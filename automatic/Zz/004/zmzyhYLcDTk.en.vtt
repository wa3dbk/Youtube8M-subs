writes<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> lengthy<00:00:20.100> question<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.000> I'm

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
writes this is a lengthy question so I'm

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.090 
writes this is a lengthy question so I'm
going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.480> kind<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.410> cut<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.769> down<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
going to just kind of cut it down and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.939 
going to just kind of cut it down and
get<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> point<00:00:23.779> he<00:00:24.779> says<00:00:25.080> many<00:00:25.500> workout

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
get to the point he says many workout

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.269 
get to the point he says many workout
videos<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.699> articles<00:00:26.939> talk<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:27.990> reps<00:00:28.710> sets

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
videos and articles talk about reps sets

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.880 
videos and articles talk about reps sets
and<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.970> type<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> exercises<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.740> often

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and the type of exercises but they often

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.580 
and the type of exercises but they often
fail<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> mention<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.480> rest<00:00:33.719> periods<00:00:34.200> between

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
fail to mention the rest periods between

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700 
fail to mention the rest periods between
sets<00:00:35.420> my<00:00:36.420> question<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.649> any

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
sets my question is are there any

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
sets my question is are there any
guidelines<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.850> give<00:00:39.030> regarding

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
guidelines that you can give regarding

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.700 
guidelines that you can give regarding
rest<00:00:39.809> times<00:00:40.110> between<00:00:40.680> sets<00:00:41.300> all<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.710> well

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
rest times between sets all right well

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
rest times between sets all right well
Kevin<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.489> absolutely<00:00:45.059> right<00:00:45.329> in

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
Kevin and you are absolutely right in

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
Kevin and you are absolutely right in
that<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> majority<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.500> workout<00:00:46.890> programs

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that the majority of workout programs

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.330 
that the majority of workout programs
only<00:00:48.300> focus<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.379> actual<00:00:49.710> sets<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
only focus on the actual sets and the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
only focus on the actual sets and the
reps<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> exercises<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.649> rest

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
reps and the exercises and the rest

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
reps and the exercises and the rest
periods<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.340> kind<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> left<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
periods are kind of left up to the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.119 
periods are kind of left up to the
individual

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
individual

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
individual
now<00:00:56.789> obviously<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.840> shorter<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> rest

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
now obviously the shorter the rest

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
now obviously the shorter the rest
period<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.520> harder<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
period the harder it's going to be the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
period the harder it's going to be the
more<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.410> involve<00:01:01.940> more<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> your

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
more it's going to involve more of your

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.899 
more it's going to involve more of your
cardiovascular<00:01:03.949> conditioning<00:01:04.949> because<00:01:05.129> when

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
cardiovascular conditioning because when

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.990 
cardiovascular conditioning because when
you<00:01:06.030> rest<00:01:06.869> less<00:01:07.320> between<00:01:07.770> sets<00:01:08.189> you're<00:01:08.820> not

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you rest less between sets you're not

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
you rest less between sets you're not
fully<00:01:09.630> recovering<00:01:10.409> between<00:01:10.950> each<00:01:11.100> set<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
fully recovering between each set so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
fully recovering between each set so
you're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.380> into<00:01:13.710> your

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you're going to get more into your

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
you're going to get more into your
conditioning<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.810> muscular<00:01:15.810> endurance<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
conditioning and muscular endurance and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
conditioning and muscular endurance and
it's<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> increase<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:18.030> lactic<00:01:18.450> acid

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it's going to increase more lactic acid

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
it's going to increase more lactic acid
build<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> system<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> don't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
build up in the system because you don't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
build up in the system because you don't
have<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> clear<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:22.280> between

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
have time to clear all that out between

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.270 
have time to clear all that out between
each<00:01:23.549> set<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.159> more

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
each set so it's going to be more

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
each set so it's going to be more
challenging<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> shorter<00:01:27.810> rest<00:01:28.200> period

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
challenging to do a shorter rest period

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
challenging to do a shorter rest period
workout<00:01:29.009> versus<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> longer<00:01:30.090> rest<00:01:30.299> period

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
workout versus a longer rest period

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.380 
workout versus a longer rest period
workout<00:01:31.009> now<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.430> pros<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> cons<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
workout now there are pros and cons to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.980 
workout now there are pros and cons to
both<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.250> there's<00:01:35.250> no<00:01:35.460> set<00:01:36.150> answer<00:01:36.390> for

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
both and there's no set answer for

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
both and there's no set answer for
what's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> best<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.909> should<00:01:39.119> do

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
what's the best and what you should do

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
what's the best and what you should do
because<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.869> depends<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> type<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
because it all depends on the type of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.580 
because it all depends on the type of
training<00:01:41.369> you're<00:01:41.490> doing<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.079> depends<00:01:43.470> on

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
training you're doing and it depends on

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
training you're doing and it depends on
where<00:01:43.950> you're<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:45.060> current<00:01:45.360> level<00:01:45.570> of

where you're at in your current level of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.230 
where you're at in your current level of

I mean a while back I actually posted up
a<00:01:52.159> great<00:01:53.180> workout<00:01:54.180> routine<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.810> uses<00:01:55.200> short

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
a great workout routine that uses short

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
a great workout routine that uses short
rest<00:01:55.950> periods<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> six<00:01:57.390> by<00:01:57.540> six

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
description below I'll have links to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.479 
description below I'll have links to
those<00:02:06.119> videos<00:02:06.469> but<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> workout

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
those videos but this is a workout

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.420 
those videos but this is a workout
routine<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.119> uses<00:02:09.770> very<00:02:10.770> short<00:02:11.190> rest

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
routine that uses very short rest

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.160 
routine that uses very short rest
periods

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
periods

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.550 
periods
literally<00:02:12.610> 15<00:02:13.610> second<00:02:14.330> rest<00:02:14.690> periods<00:02:15.200> between

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
literally 15 second rest periods between

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.339 
literally 15 second rest periods between
sets<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.120> idea<00:02:17.480> here<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:17.810> you're<00:02:18.140> going<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
sets so the idea here is you're going to

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.520 
sets so the idea here is you're going to
spur<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.680> muscle<00:02:19.580> growth<00:02:19.760> through<00:02:20.750> cumulative

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
spur on muscle growth through cumulative

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.470 
spur on muscle growth through cumulative
fatigue<00:02:21.650> through<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.550> very<00:02:22.880> short<00:02:23.239> rest

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
fatigue through the very short rest

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.290 
fatigue through the very short rest
periods<00:02:23.810> because<00:02:24.140> each<00:02:24.770> set<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.880> fatigue

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
periods because each set the fatigue

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.630 
periods because each set the fatigue
compounds<00:02:27.170> itself<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:28.280> you're<00:02:28.489> not

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
compounds itself because you're not

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.210 
compounds itself because you're not
fully<00:02:29.000> recovering<00:02:29.630> between<00:02:29.989> sets<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:30.950> mean

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
fully recovering between sets so I mean

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.790 
fully recovering between sets so I mean
it's<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.640> unique<00:02:32.030> way<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.239> training<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
it's a unique way of training and that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.740 
it's a unique way of training and that
can<00:02:34.010> work<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.489> mean<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:34.910> you're<00:02:35.239> normally

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
can work I mean if you're normally

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.900 
can work I mean if you're normally
resting<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.739> couple<00:02:37.010> minutes<00:02:37.160> or<00:02:37.400> more<00:02:37.550> between

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
resting a couple minutes or more between

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.490 
resting a couple minutes or more between
sets<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.959> sudden<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.470> change

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
sets and then all of a sudden you change

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.710 
sets and then all of a sudden you change
it<00:02:40.010> up<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> program<00:02:41.209> where<00:02:41.630> you're

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
it up and you do a program where you're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.890 
it up and you do a program where you're
resting<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:42.860> short<00:02:43.160> between<00:02:43.640> sets<00:02:44.090> such

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
resting really short between sets such

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
resting really short between sets such
as<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.230> six<00:02:45.440> by<00:02:45.560> six<00:02:45.769> program<00:02:46.220> where<00:02:46.940> you're

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
as the six by six program where you're

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.350 
as the six by six program where you're
doing<00:02:47.150> 15<00:02:47.690> seconds<00:02:48.260> rest<00:02:48.800> periods<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:50.150> is

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
doing 15 seconds rest periods that is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.330 
doing 15 seconds rest periods that is
going<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.690> totally<00:02:51.080> change<00:02:51.110> up<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.069> way<00:02:52.190> your

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
going to totally change up the way your

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.050 
going to totally change up the way your
body<00:02:52.489> works<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.390> way<00:02:53.510> your<00:02:53.750> body<00:02:53.900> is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
body works and the way your body is

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.309 
body works and the way your body is
stimulating<00:02:56.060> muscle<00:02:56.180> growth<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:56.989> mean<00:02:57.200> that

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
stimulating muscle growth so I mean that

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.580 
stimulating muscle growth so I mean that
can<00:02:57.470> work<00:02:57.620> now<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.850> flip<00:02:59.030> side<00:02:59.590> longer

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
can work now on the flip side longer

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.759 
can work now on the flip side longer
rest<00:03:00.980> periods<00:03:01.400> will<00:03:01.760> allow<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.769> fully

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
rest periods will allow you to fully

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.440 
rest periods will allow you to fully
rest<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.340> recover<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:04.880> will<00:03:05.030> allow<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.330> to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
rest and recover it will allow you to

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.350 
rest and recover it will allow you to
regenerate<00:03:06.380> your<00:03:06.890> body's<00:03:07.489> energy<00:03:07.970> systems

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
regenerate your body's energy systems

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.809 
regenerate your body's energy systems
the<00:03:08.510> ATP<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.250> going<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.549> allow<00:03:10.760> you

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
the ATP and that is going to allow you

to<00:03:10.940> lift<00:03:11.180> heavier<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.900> very<00:03:12.590> often<00:03:12.950> you'll

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
to lift heavier and very often you'll

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.449

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
long periods of time between sets I mean

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.910 
long periods of time between sets I mean
it's<00:03:19.190> common<00:03:19.489> in<00:03:19.820> powerlifting<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:21.230> rest<00:03:21.500> five

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
it's common in powerlifting to rest five

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.330 
it's common in powerlifting to rest five
minutes<00:03:22.400> or<00:03:22.670> more<00:03:23.030> between<00:03:23.390> sets<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.530> order<00:03:25.010> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
depends on what you're training for is

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.160 
depends on what you're training for is

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
long you should rest between sets then a

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.830 
long you should rest between sets then a
a<00:03:47.989> good<00:03:48.380> guideline<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.920> you<00:03:49.100> can<00:03:49.280> follow<00:03:49.519> is

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
a good guideline that you can follow is

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.870 
a good guideline that you can follow is
to<00:03:50.840> rest<00:03:51.079> between<00:03:51.320> one<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:52.040> two<00:03:52.519> minutes

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
to rest between one and two minutes

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.630 
to rest between one and two minutes

between sets for isolation exercises and
smaller<00:03:56.239> movements<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.470> things<00:03:57.769> like<00:03:59.109> leg

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
smaller movements so things like leg

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.080

like<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.510> can<00:04:08.690> rest<00:04:08.959> anywhere<00:04:09.380> between

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
like that you can rest anywhere between

those<00:04:21.349> type<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.620> exercises<00:04:22.400> you'll<00:04:22.610> probably

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
those type of exercises you'll probably

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.900 
those type of exercises you'll probably
want<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.270> stretch

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
want to stretch

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.210 
want to stretch
the<00:04:23.970> rest<00:04:24.150> period<00:04:24.480> out<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:25.260> three<00:04:25.710> minutes<00:04:26.040> or

the rest period out to three minutes or
even<00:04:26.520> more<00:04:26.700> between<00:04:27.390> sets<00:04:27.870> especially<00:04:28.500> as

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
even more between sets especially as

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.170 
even more between sets especially as
you're<00:04:29.070> getting<00:04:29.220> up<00:04:29.430> into<00:04:29.640> your<00:04:29.850> heavier

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
you're getting up into your heavier

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.380 
you're getting up into your heavier
working<00:04:30.780> sense<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:32.190> that's<00:04:32.610> some<00:04:33.030> general

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
working sense so that's some general

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.000 
working sense so that's some general
guidelines<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.050> can<00:04:34.200> follow<00:04:34.350> but

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
guidelines that you can follow but

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.890 
guidelines that you can follow but
realize<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.120> risk<00:04:36.360> periods<00:04:36.750> between

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
realize that the risk periods between

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.230 
realize that the risk periods between
scents<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.620> another<00:04:38.010> variable<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.060> can

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
scents is another variable that you can

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.870 
scents is another variable that you can
manipulate<00:04:39.510> within<00:04:40.500> your<00:04:40.680> training<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.640> help

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
manipulate within your training to help

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.330 
manipulate within your training to help
spur<00:04:42.450> on<00:04:42.570> some<00:04:42.780> new<00:04:42.900> growth<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.920> if<00:04:44.220> you're

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
spur on some new growth so if you're

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.250 
spur on some new growth so if you're
following<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.940> set<00:04:45.150> routine<00:04:45.360> right<00:04:45.780> now<00:04:45.840> and

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
following a set routine right now and

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.980 
following a set routine right now and
you<00:04:47.040> know<00:04:47.160> it's<00:04:47.640> been<00:04:47.790> working<00:04:47.970> for<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.750> up

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
you know it's been working for you up

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.840 
you know it's been working for you up
until<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.440> point<00:04:49.530> but<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.310> want<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.550> kind<00:04:50.760> of

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
until this point but you want to kind of

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.420 
until this point but you want to kind of
change<00:04:51.420> it<00:04:51.600> up<00:04:51.720> or<00:04:51.930> up<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.290> intensity<00:04:52.710> then

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
change it up or up the intensity then

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.910 
change it up or up the intensity then
rather<00:04:53.940> than<00:04:54.120> simply<00:04:54.960> try<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.290> increase<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
rather than simply try to increase the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.010 
rather than simply try to increase the
weight<00:04:56.040> each<00:04:56.370> workout<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.510> can<00:04:57.750> have<00:04:57.990> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
weight each workout you can have a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.630 
weight each workout you can have a
different<00:04:58.440> form<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.920> progressive<00:04:59.370> overload

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
different form of progressive overload

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.000 
different form of progressive overload
by<00:05:00.270> reducing<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.110> rest<00:05:01.320> periods<00:05:01.770> between

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
by reducing the rest periods between

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.600 
by reducing the rest periods between
sets

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
sets

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.210 
sets
so<00:05:03.240> strive<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.780> get<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.020> same<00:05:04.290> volume<00:05:04.890> of

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
so strive to get the same volume of

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.880 
so strive to get the same volume of
training<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.000> same<00:05:06.210> workload<00:05:06.570> done<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:07.740> with

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
training the same workload done but with

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.590 
training the same workload done but with
shorter<00:05:08.400> rest<00:05:08.610> breaks<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.390> will

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
shorter rest breaks and that will

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.300 
shorter rest breaks and that will
instantly<00:05:10.050> increase<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.530> intensity<00:05:10.920> and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
instantly increase the intensity and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.370 
instantly increase the intensity and
thus<00:05:12.000> increase<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.600> demands<00:05:12.870> on<00:05:13.080> your<00:05:13.200> body

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
thus increase the demands on your body

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.470 
thus increase the demands on your body
so<00:05:13.800> like<00:05:14.010> say<00:05:14.280> it's<00:05:14.610> just<00:05:14.820> another<00:05:15.060> variable

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
so like say it's just another variable

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.090 
so like say it's just another variable
that<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:15.990> manipulate<00:05:16.260> within<00:05:16.980> your

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
that you can manipulate within your

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.480 
that you can manipulate within your
training<00:05:18.140> so<00:05:19.140> anyway<00:05:20.070> hopefully<00:05:20.280> hopefully

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
training so anyway hopefully hopefully

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.130 
training so anyway hopefully hopefully
that<00:05:20.790> helps<00:05:21.030> answer<00:05:21.240> your<00:05:21.390> question<00:05:21.810> Kevin

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
that helps answer your question Kevin

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.230 
that helps answer your question Kevin
