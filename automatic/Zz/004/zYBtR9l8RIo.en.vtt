00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.290
 youtube friends this time 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.780
 I bring for the tablets simple 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.750
 I have found many who have asked 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.000
 this tablet does not bring the keys up or 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.950
 lower volume to do the hard reset or 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.020
 to format make them play at 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.990
 operating system as such if then 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.410
 as we see this is blocked then 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:30.880
 pattern of numbers then we're going to 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.860
 format the tablet the silver s 700 720 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.210
 and we are going to see it this other one that is a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.949
 simple also of the biggest that of 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.250
 10 inches that this is the r 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.989
 30s from here for two is a little 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.460
 complicated to get the forward of the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.160
 greatness of the small the little one is more 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.500
 easy then I'll leave the links 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.659
 download below the video while 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.269
 So he will show the method as 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:56.250
 We do proceed then the first thing 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.250
 everything that we are going to download the program 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.890
 the first program that we are going to download 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.890
 is the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.430
 it's called sweet sweet pawns that I'm going to 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.400
 give the good download after having it 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.720
 downloaded we run it is very easy to 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.280
 appear in Chinese simply gives them 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.010
 next next next lower the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.290
 link where as installing and this 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.780
 after we have it installed what 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.210
 we execute what is this 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.830
 and we have permission rights there 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.580
 appears the foot in mind is very simple 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.040
 first of all we connect the charger 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.400
 so that we generate a very 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.400
 brief 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.380
 We hope that we recognize the charger 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.380
 now we pay it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.789
 after turning off we hope that we 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.729
 look like loading list is loading 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.270
 it's very simple there is simply the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.860
 key 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.539
 power on and there 's the key 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.759
 welcome are both then do not you 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.969
 has turned on the power of no sound of 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.420
 hans or the welcome and we connect the 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.420
 USB Cable 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.950
 we connect 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.320
 we wait a little bit and hold for 10 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.640
 seconds the home key on the tablet 7 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.600
 inches 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.380
 right now we will see the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.380
 recognition 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.599
 we hope you do not recognize it 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.819
 now we see the model this model 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.439
 the sct is the same 3 738 appear 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.319
 operating system has 4 points with 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.970
 all is subject but specific we already have 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.489
 the downloaded firmware I 'm also going to 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.040
 leave the firmware from it that is 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.510
 located where we have located it but 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.190
 I already have downloads and I have it 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.959
 ready what is this 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.959
 then three of 7.20 version 3 that is 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.340
 one in ing that serves us then 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.109
 we know the route link where is 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.530
 located in mind we go where it says 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.530
 firmware 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.379
 we are located in the firmware we go here 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.329
 where it says image and we go and place it 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.829
 then I already have it in download only 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.709
 I have some specific folders 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.569
 then we choose the image that we are going to 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.280
 open we give it that we open and 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.950
 automatically forms the biche the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.989
 file 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.090
 let's download it and ask us 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.819
 If we want to delete all the data, 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.420
 we say that if we wait a little bit 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.790
 the operating system is already mounting 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.950
 asks if you want to delete all 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.209
 the data format all this in mode 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.209
 recover then we say yes 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 we wait a moment we work that 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.780
 100% charge is very easy and very 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.790
 simple is simply to use the most 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.130
 complicated in the 10-inch is 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.650
 get the original forward of it yes 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.230
 but how many of you get it the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.420
 process of installing new the new 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.060
 new forward operating system is very 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.280
 easy is very simple and any little thing 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.390
 Well, do not forget to ask the same way 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.670
 I'll leave you well 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.090
 specific to do so is very 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.090
 simple 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.830
 so you can recognize it can turn it off 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.990
 turn on with the cable connected and the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.030
 necessarily connected charger and 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.260
 some tell is that when I show you 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.640
 like the birds that talk knows because 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.740
 what we have try to appear the 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.010
 version of the tablet and there are hundreds for 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.120
 upload the image to go is very simple 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.170
 let's say we did not delay 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.170
 formerly the download 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.220
 and this has ended the process now we 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.780
 It is going on the tablet and see it 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.550
 if you want the time was delayed 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.729
 3 minutes and 59 seconds 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.960
 let's say ok and ready what you give them 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.210
 you know how they recognize them 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.340
 because this graphic appears 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.349
 welcome aircraft tour the model of the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.810
 tablet or where they can look for the firmware 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.370
 if it is another simple of the same other 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.840
 model they connect and that is the 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.159
 recognize the wall the firmware so that 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.830
 they look for it in the network and they can 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.780
 download and very simple nothing then 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.310
 we hope that we configure now 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.310
 we look with see here 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.890
 this did not ignite anymore we entered the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.030
 operating system but remember that it is 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.470
 a little slow this tablet so 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.360
 general has always been slow 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.320
 we have fully restored without 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.800
 pattern code 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.990
 with an operating system is failing 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.750
 many stay in the logo and do not advance 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.290
 also for the least 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.290
 and ready
