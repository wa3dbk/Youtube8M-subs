00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.390 

I'll<00:00:08.290> tell<00:00:08.469> you<00:00:08.620> sorry

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
I'll tell you sorry

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.250 
I'll tell you sorry
this<00:00:09.940> time<00:00:10.120> I'm<00:00:10.300> going<00:00:10.510> to<00:00:10.600> show<00:00:10.690> you<00:00:10.840> how<00:00:11.200> you

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
this time I'm going to show you how you

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.740 
this time I'm going to show you how you
can<00:00:11.500> remove<00:00:11.969> recorded<00:00:12.969> noise<00:00:13.120> from<00:00:13.540> the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
can remove recorded noise from the

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.750 
can remove recorded noise from the
guitar<00:00:14.020> amplifier<00:00:14.469> tracks

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.689 

so<00:00:19.390> if<00:00:19.689> you<00:00:19.960> have<00:00:20.109> ever<00:00:20.350> actually<00:00:20.800> recorded

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
so if you have ever actually recorded

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.269 
so if you have ever actually recorded
real<00:00:22.449> guitar<00:00:23.170> amplifiers<00:00:23.650> you<00:00:23.830> will<00:00:23.980> know

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
real guitar amplifiers you will know

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.600 
real guitar amplifiers you will know
that<00:00:24.310> they<00:00:24.849> will<00:00:25.090> create<00:00:25.449> some<00:00:25.930> noise<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:26.800> you

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
that they will create some noise and you

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.990 
that they will create some noise and you
can<00:00:27.820> even<00:00:28.150> hear<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.630> noise<00:00:28.779> during<00:00:29.349> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
can even hear the noise during the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.939 
can even hear the noise during the
performance<00:00:31.000> so<00:00:31.239> you<00:00:31.840> just<00:00:32.110> have<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.349> get<00:00:32.920> rid

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
performance so you just have to get rid

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.200 
performance so you just have to get rid
of<00:00:33.190> it

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
of it

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.510 
of it
and<00:00:37.090> how<00:00:38.090> we<00:00:38.150> get<00:00:38.360> rid<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.630> it<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.020> that<00:00:39.620> we<00:00:40.070> use

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
and how we get rid of it is that we use

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.600 
and how we get rid of it is that we use
the<00:00:40.820> waves<00:00:41.510> Z<00:00:42.050> noise<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.920> can<00:00:43.100> find<00:00:43.400> it<00:00:43.520> under

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
the waves Z noise you can find it under

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.330 
the waves Z noise you can find it under
restoration<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.570> Cubase<00:00:44.960> okay<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:45.590> first<00:00:46.040> what

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
restoration in Cubase okay so first what

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.790 
restoration in Cubase okay so first what
we<00:00:46.520> need<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:46.820> do<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:47.360> that<00:00:47.720> we<00:00:47.900> open<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.590> Z

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
we need to do is that we open the Z

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.980 
we need to do is that we open the Z
noise<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:49.580> we<00:00:49.700> see<00:00:49.970> this<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.300> then<00:00:50.840> you

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
noise and then we see this and then you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.260 
noise and then we see this and then you
might<00:00:51.170> be<00:00:51.350> why<00:00:51.800> there's<00:00:52.280> too<00:00:52.580> many<00:00:52.700> controls

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
might be why there's too many controls

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.670 
might be why there's too many controls
oh<00:00:53.420> no<00:00:53.930> don't<00:00:54.230> panic

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
oh no don't panic

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040 
oh no don't panic
so<00:00:55.280> first<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:55.760> need<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.090> find<00:00:56.240> a<00:00:56.390> spot<00:00:56.660> in<00:00:56.870> the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
so first we need to find a spot in the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.850 
so first we need to find a spot in the
song<00:00:57.290> when<00:00:57.590> there<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:58.100> only<00:00:58.810> noise<00:00:59.860> for

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
song when there is only noise for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.780 
song when there is only noise for
example<00:01:01.160> here

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.380 

or<00:01:04.860> after

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380 

anyway<00:01:10.390> but<00:01:11.200> if<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.340> listen<00:01:12.640> closely<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.210> can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
anyway but if you listen closely you can

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.039 
anyway but if you listen closely you can
hear<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.900> same<00:01:14.080> noise<00:01:14.140> during<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.159> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
hear the same noise during the this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:25.450 
hear the same noise during the this
actual<00:01:17.049> performance<00:01:17.799> part

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.110 

it's<00:01:26.420> quiet<00:01:26.750> but<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.170> there<00:01:27.440> anyway<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:28.610> what

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's quiet but it's there anyway so what

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.060 
it's quiet but it's there anyway so what
we<00:01:29.270> do<00:01:29.480> is<00:01:29.690> that<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:30.050> click<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.920> noise

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
we do is that we click on the noise

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.880 
we do is that we click on the noise
profile<00:01:31.610> learn<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.140> part<00:01:33.380> where<00:01:33.590> there<00:01:33.800> is

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
profile learn in the part where there is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.920 
profile learn in the part where there is
only<00:01:34.190> noise<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.550> have<00:01:34.700> looped<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.180> as<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:35.810> can

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
only noise I have looped it as you can

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.530 
only noise I have looped it as you can
see<00:01:36.170> I<00:01:36.350> have<00:01:36.590> looped<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:37.010> part<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:38.330> will

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
see I have looped this part so it will

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.239 
see I have looped this part so it will
only<00:01:38.750> capture<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:40.070> noise<00:01:40.250> from<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:40.820> part

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.300 

and<00:01:46.049> when<00:01:47.049> we<00:01:47.200> are<00:01:47.319> done<00:01:47.439> with<00:01:47.679> just<00:01:47.829> unclick

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
and when we are done with just unclick

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.469 
and when we are done with just unclick
learn

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
learn

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.130 
learn
and<00:01:50.800> we<00:01:51.800> are<00:01:51.860> done<00:01:51.979> okay<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:53.030> next<00:01:53.570> what<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.960> do

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
and we are done okay so next what we do

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.840 
and we are done okay so next what we do
is<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.650> we<00:01:54.710> go<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.250> part<00:01:55.490> where<00:01:55.820> we

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
is that we go to the part where we

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.230 
is that we go to the part where we
actually<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.990> music<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.729> then<00:01:58.729> we

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
actually have the music and then we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.800 
actually have the music and then we
increase<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.409> reduction<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.659> decrease<00:02:02.659> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
increase the reduction and decrease the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.990 
increase the reduction and decrease the
threshold<00:02:03.020> all<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.619> way<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.979> then<00:02:04.670> what<00:02:04.850> we

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
threshold all the way and then what we

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.840 
threshold all the way and then what we
do<00:02:05.150> is<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.510> go<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.070> monitor<00:02:07.070> difference

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
do is we go to the monitor difference

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.540 
do is we go to the monitor difference
mode<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.570> we<00:02:08.840> want<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.200> only<00:02:09.410> hear<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.369> noise

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
mode and we want to only hear the noise

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.320 
mode and we want to only hear the noise
and<00:02:11.380> then<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.530> increase<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.250> threshold<00:02:13.490> until

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and then we increase the threshold until

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.860 
and then we increase the threshold until
we<00:02:14.600> are<00:02:14.750> at<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.140> point<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:17.750> reference

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
we are at that point and for reference

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.470 
we are at that point and for reference
let's<00:02:18.320> listen<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.000> guitar<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.239> know

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
let's listen to the guitar so you know

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.910 
let's listen to the guitar so you know
what<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:21.020> coming<00:02:21.440> through<00:02:26.650> okay<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.770> have

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
what is coming through okay we have

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.460 
what is coming through okay we have
something<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.820> coming<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.630> when<00:02:30.320> we

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
something like that coming so when we

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.920 
something like that coming so when we
hear<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.940> usually<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.570> high<00:02:32.720> end

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
hear that that usually the high end

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.620 
hear that that usually the high end
comes<00:02:33.200> first<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.680> let's<00:02:34.040> try<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.880> get<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
comes first so let's try to get it so

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.199 
comes first so let's try to get it so
that<00:02:35.870> we<00:02:36.050> only<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.430> turn<00:02:37.820> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
that we only get that so I turn the
