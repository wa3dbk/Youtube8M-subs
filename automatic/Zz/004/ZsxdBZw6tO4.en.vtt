00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
wanted to get the skin color all I do is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
wanted to get the skin color all I do is
type<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.530> slash<00:01:22.920> skin<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.880> smooth<00:01:25.729> then

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
type in slash skin and then smooth then

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310

it'll give him the skin color so I quite
like<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.280> looks<00:01:29.430> pretty

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
like that one I think that looks pretty

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
like that one I think that looks pretty
close<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.240> he<00:01:30.329> looks<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.920> other

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
close to what he looks like the other

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.030 
close to what he looks like the other
two<00:01:32.280> options<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.790> had<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.420> skin<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
two options you had our skin the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.170 
two options you had our skin the
player's<00:01:35.460> name<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.500> then<00:01:37.500> either<00:01:37.799> clay<00:01:38.280> or

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
player's name and then either clay or

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840 
player's name and then either clay or
glass<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.530> depending<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.670> want

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
glass so depending on which one you want

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
glass so depending on which one you want
personally<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.170> playing<00:01:43.619> glass

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
personally I don't think playing glass

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
personally I don't think playing glass
that<00:01:44.189> great<00:01:44.430> certain<00:01:45.360> skins<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.930> look

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that great certain skins would look

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660 
that great certain skins would look
