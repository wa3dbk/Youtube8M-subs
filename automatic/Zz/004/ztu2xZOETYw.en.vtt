00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 the ever- popular lego fans often three 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.240
 from famous brands continues cheerfully 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 after batman the marvel super heroes and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 Tolkien's hobbit is now also the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 current cinema hits the racing world in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.910
 poured virtual plastic 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.800
 the total of 20 story missions of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.270
 lego dressing world not only treat 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.550
 the events from the new strip 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 but also all important scenes 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 the previous three episodes so experienced 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.859
 for example, the chase 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.720
 with the gigantic terex as 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.520
 action packed mix of blocks 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.050
 Collect and baller insert 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
 significantly exciting runs in which it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.410
 the famous kitchens fight against the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.149
 ravenous raptors from the first part 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.250
 even if there are developers tt games 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.899
 not typical for serials 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 the template holds there it can already 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.379
 times happen that the virtual dinos 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.379
 to orient slapsticks 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.150
 far less ridiculous is the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.440
 actual gameplay you walk with 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.600
 a little hero troop through 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.520
 colorful 3d areale and deppert 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.170
 as many objects as possible 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 not only collector items but 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.350
 also action-relevant objects 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.670
 Uncovered the puzzles work 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.890
 always with the same character 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.510
 change the principle while he is one 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.220
 recke hidden things can dig 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.140
 the other one has a grip hook 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.550
 with which one objects such as these 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.860
 squeaky duck through the area 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.690
 catapulted is much more innovative 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.150
 The integration of the dinosaur Rex 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.740
 triceratops and co dive not only as 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.869
 opponent but also as playable 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.220
 figures on during the large-scale 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.350
 duels like this fight against the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.360
 spinosaurus east racing pack 3 just bare 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.760
 quick time events are coming others 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 levels are much funnier 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.060
 For example, we hunt in shape 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.920
 a raptors duo a piggy 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.550
 that partout does not feed 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.930
 wants to let 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.220
 it is quite silly that the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.320
 prehistoric to the lego kits 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.880
 assemble can make this mood 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 but sections anyway 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.380
 also and especially if you have one 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.020
 player as offline co- op partner 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 Add something at any time to simple 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.310
 Button pressure works 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.470
 off the story missions one is waiting 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.080
 kind of ddr light on discovery funny 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.790
 player with isla saona and isla nobler 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 Two islands are freely explored 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.990
 partly on foot or on board one of the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.460
 numerous vehicles to 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.570
 discovering contents turn out to be 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.400
 however, as quite thin 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.200
 no matter if you have golden lego bricks 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.780
 Collected or photos of important 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.030
 Locals shoot far more amusingly 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.740
 there is the dino editor with which you look 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 from unlocked items one 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.480
 stÃ¶pseln individual dinosaur together 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 Lego titles can live on forever 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.740
 her charming staging and racing 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.660
 world is no exception 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.370
 thanks to the original speaker from the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.380
 cinematographic and wonderfully staged 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.120
 between sequences full of gags one comes 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.250
 barely out of the smirk 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.990
 whether you are a cinema fan or not 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.490
 playfully converts title games 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.920
 but on trodden paths 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.140
 This can also be distraction maneuvers 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.760
 the playable dinosaurs do not change anything like that 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.920
 the basic concept of lego weighs heavily 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.170
 It may take a little time to play 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.760
 a general overhaul maybe yes 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.760
 already at the next blocks game
