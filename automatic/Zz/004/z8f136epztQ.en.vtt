we have redwood and this is actually a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.040 
we have redwood and this is actually a
glaze<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.149> dark<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> looks<00:00:48.899> in

the tube it will go on with a
semi-translucent<00:00:52.289> color<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.320> layer

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
semi-translucent color and you can layer

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
semi-translucent color and you can layer
it<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.890> other<00:00:56.190> colors<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.850> where<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> itself

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840

is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.949> lip<00:01:02.129> gloss<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> more

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
is a lip gloss so this one is more

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
is a lip gloss so this one is more
pigmented<00:01:03.840> than<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> red<00:01:04.350> winners<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
pigmented than the red winners and it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
similar to the color in the tube and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.690 
similar to the color in the tube and
then<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:12.860> Viridian<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> dark

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
then we have Viridian which is a dark

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.679 
then we have Viridian which is a dark
green<00:01:16.280> eyeshadow<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.509> bit

of<00:01:18.750> shimmer<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.189> harder<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> see

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
