00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
come together they sort of happened it's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.860 
come together they sort of happened it's
not<00:03:18.710> very<00:03:18.860> obvious<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.030> basically<00:03:20.570> what<00:03:20.810> it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
not very obvious but basically what it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.720 
not very obvious but basically what it
does<00:03:20.990> is<00:03:22.360> when<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.560> there<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.520> see<00:03:25.700> that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
does is when it's there you can see that

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.690 
does is when it's there you can see that
a<00:03:25.880> little<00:03:26.210> bit

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.559 

that<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.569> basically<00:03:35.930> makes<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.440> lay<00:03:36.980> flat

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
that just basically makes it lay flat

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.800 
that just basically makes it lay flat
totally<00:03:38.569> when<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.410> hanging<00:03:40.330> even<00:03:41.330> if<00:03:41.480> it's

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
totally when it's hanging even if it's

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.630 
totally when it's hanging even if it's
on<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.260> curve<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:42.890> if<00:03:43.040> you're<00:03:43.160> sitting<00:03:43.370> down

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
on a curve like if you're sitting down

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.589 
on a curve like if you're sitting down
still<00:03:44.239> lays<00:03:44.510> flat<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.790> can<00:03:46.910> feel<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.239> once

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
still lays flat and you can feel it once

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.020 
still lays flat and you can feel it once
when<00:03:48.200> done<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.980> enters<00:03:49.280> your<00:03:49.430> pocket<00:03:49.879> which<00:03:50.000> is

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
when done it enters your pocket which is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.920 
when done it enters your pocket which is
good<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.510> case<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.840> pickpockets<00:03:52.599> what<00:03:53.599> else<00:03:53.840> is

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
good in case of pickpockets what else is

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.070 
good in case of pickpockets what else is
interesting<00:03:54.080> yeah<00:03:54.709> there's<00:03:55.040> also<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:56.080> little

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
interesting yeah there's also a little

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.610 
interesting yeah there's also a little
loop<00:03:59.980> how<00:04:00.980> best<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.580> show<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:01.910> there<00:04:02.620> well

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
loop how best to show that there well

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.559 
loop how best to show that there well
loop<00:04:03.860> just<00:04:04.370> inside<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.790> pocket<00:04:07.030> for<00:04:08.030> hanging

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
loop just inside the pocket for hanging

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.539 
loop just inside the pocket for hanging
stuff<00:04:08.599> on<00:04:09.880> um<00:04:10.880> that's<00:04:11.390> basically<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.250> I

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
stuff on um that's basically it so I

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.909 
stuff on um that's basically it so I
still<00:04:14.090> need<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.269> do<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:16.299> right-hand<00:04:17.299> pocket

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
still need to do the right-hand pocket

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.890 
still need to do the right-hand pocket
so<00:04:18.919> where<00:04:19.609> there's<00:04:19.790> going<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.239> be<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.389> pocket

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
so where there's going to be a pocket

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.900 
so where there's going to be a pocket
right<00:04:21.079> now<00:04:21.139> there's<00:04:21.620> just<00:04:22.180> pins<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:24.729> it's<00:04:25.729> not

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
right now there's just pins and it's not

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.100 
right now there's just pins and it's not
even<00:04:25.940> cut<00:04:26.450> opens<00:04:26.810> that's<00:04:27.110> solid<00:04:27.860> cloth<00:04:30.220> and

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
even cut opens that's solid cloth and

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.219 
even cut opens that's solid cloth and
yeah<00:04:33.110> that's<00:04:33.970> next<00:04:34.970> step<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.389> make<00:04:36.050> this

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
yeah that's next step is make this

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.460 
yeah that's next step is make this
pocket<00:04:36.680> same<00:04:37.250> as<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.460> other<00:04:37.580> one<00:04:37.820> except

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
pocket same as the other one except

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.350 
pocket same as the other one except
fancier<00:04:39.470> because<00:04:40.310> it's<00:04:40.490> under<00:04:40.729> underneath

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
fancier because it's under underneath

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.840 
fancier because it's under underneath
and<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:45.229> can<00:04:45.380> make<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.830> underneath<00:04:46.580> one

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
and and I can make the underneath one

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.340 
and and I can make the underneath one
bigger<00:04:47.120> because<00:04:47.389> it's<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.750> right<00:04:47.870> side<00:04:48.139> one

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
bigger because it's the right side one

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.850 
bigger because it's the right side one
and<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:48.860> under<00:04:49.930> whereas<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.260> left<00:04:51.620> had

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
and so it's under whereas the left had

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.580 
and so it's under whereas the left had
one<00:04:52.220> is<00:04:52.490> on<00:04:52.700> top<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.180> bottom<00:04:53.479> apron<00:04:54.190> so

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
one is on top of the bottom apron so

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.560 
one is on top of the bottom apron so
it<00:04:57.100> can't<00:04:57.310> be<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.490> big<00:04:57.850> but<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.150> right<00:04:58.300> side

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
it can't be that big but the right side

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.570 
it can't be that big but the right side
pocket<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.380> just<00:04:59.620> sort<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.070> hanging<00:05:00.280> between

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
pocket is just sort of hanging between

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.570 
pocket is just sort of hanging between
the<00:05:00.880> legs<00:05:01.060> without<00:05:01.540> anything<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.460> can

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
the legs without anything and that can

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.240 
the legs without anything and that can
be<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.330> little<00:05:04.690> girl<00:05:04.900> can<00:05:05.140> be<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.590> little<00:05:05.980> more

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
be a little girl can be a little more

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
be a little girl can be a little more
more<00:05:07.680> central<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:09.100> instead<00:05:09.550> of<00:05:09.610> hanging

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.000 

instead<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.420> hanging<00:05:17.730> approximately<00:05:18.730> here

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
instead of hanging approximately here

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:37.500 
instead of hanging approximately here
which<00:05:21.010> is<00:05:21.810> where<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:32.970> here<00:05:35.940> my<00:05:36.940> camera<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.330> not

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
which is where the here my camera is not

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.270 
which is where the here my camera is not
cooperating<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:40.600> left-hand<00:05:41.080> pocket<00:05:41.380> rests

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
cooperating the left-hand pocket rests

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.340 
cooperating the left-hand pocket rests
basically<00:05:42.790> right<00:05:42.970> on<00:05:43.090> top<00:05:43.360> of<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.630> leg<00:05:43.810> the

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
basically right on top of the leg the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.020 
basically right on top of the leg the
right-hand<00:05:44.740> pocket<00:05:44.950> can<00:05:45.370> rest<00:05:45.550> between<00:05:45.880> the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
right-hand pocket can rest between the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.120 
right-hand pocket can rest between the
legs<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.450> so<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.930> can<00:05:47.110> carry<00:05:47.380> more<00:05:47.650> can<00:05:47.950> be

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
legs and so it can carry more can be

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.320 
legs and so it can carry more can be
wider<00:05:49.120> it<00:05:49.390> can<00:05:49.510> be<00:05:49.830> fancier<00:05:50.830> etc<00:05:52.380> then<00:05:53.380> there's

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
wider it can be fancier etc then there's

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.990 
wider it can be fancier etc then there's
adding<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.420> couple<00:05:55.750> more<00:05:55.870> pots<00:05:56.410> possibly<00:05:57.190> maybe

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
adding a couple more pots possibly maybe
