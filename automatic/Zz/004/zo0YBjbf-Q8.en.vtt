and of course Rochelle Goyle he's not
one<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.030> likes<00:01:51.270> dying<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:51.869> much<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.380> least

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
one that likes dying very much at least

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.520 
one that likes dying very much at least
staying<00:01:52.979> dead<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.369> long<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.899> at<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.290> end<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
staying dead for long so at the end of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.789 
staying dead for long so at the end of
Arkham<00:01:55.860> City<00:01:56.280> many<00:01:56.640> attest<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.320> lazarus

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
Arkham City many attest that the lazarus

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
Arkham City many attest that the lazarus
pit<00:01:58.829> was<00:01:59.189> destroyed<00:01:59.579> by<00:01:59.759> Clayface<00:02:00.240> however<00:02:00.600> I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
pit was destroyed by Clayface however I

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
pit was destroyed by Clayface however I
think<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.740> lazarus<00:02:02.130> pit<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.430> still

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
think that the lazarus pit is still

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.969 
think that the lazarus pit is still
fully<00:02:02.850> functional<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.680> despite

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
fully functional and you know despite

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
fully functional and you know despite
the<00:02:05.130> fact<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.700> Clayface<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> his

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the fact that Clayface was all in it his

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050 
the fact that Clayface was all in it his
his<00:02:07.530> basically<00:02:07.920> entire<00:02:08.129> body<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.670> engulfed

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
his basically entire body was engulfed

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.479 
his basically entire body was engulfed
in<00:02:09.270> um<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.530> large<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.280> still

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
in um the large but I think it's still

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.490 
in um the large but I think it's still
fully<00:02:12.180> functional<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
fully functional so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
fully functional so
that<00:02:13.860> may<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.220> hint<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.580> something<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that may be a hint at something in this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.020 
that may be a hint at something in this
Harkin<00:02:15.480> verse<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.890> ratio<00:02:16.890> may<00:02:17.340> very<00:02:17.670> well<00:02:17.850> be

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
Harkin verse that ratio may very well be

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.880 
Harkin verse that ratio may very well be
alive<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.690> he<00:02:19.020> wasn't<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> sword<00:02:19.830> and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
alive because he wasn't on the sword and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.260 
alive because he wasn't on the sword and
of<00:02:20.010> course<00:02:20.250> Thalia<00:02:20.550> didn't<00:02:20.820> save<00:02:20.970> him<00:02:21.150> because

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
of course Thalia didn't save him because

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.860 
of course Thalia didn't save him because
Thalia<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:23.010> dead<00:02:23.580> Noblet<00:02:24.420> ten<00:02:24.660> minutes

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
Thalia was a dead Noblet ten minutes

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.870 
Thalia was a dead Noblet ten minutes
later<00:02:25.020> after<00:02:25.200> her<00:02:25.470> father<00:02:25.740> who<00:02:26.490> we<00:02:26.670> thought

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
later after her father who we thought

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.270 
later after her father who we thought
was<00:02:27.060> dead<00:02:27.240> but<00:02:27.540> his<00:02:28.260> body<00:02:28.470> certainly<00:02:28.770> missing

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
was dead but his body certainly missing

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.790 
was dead but his body certainly missing
so<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:30.060> course<00:02:30.330> maybe<00:02:30.630> their<00:02:30.840> servants<00:02:31.380> um<00:02:31.560> all

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
so of course maybe their servants um all

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.180 
so of course maybe their servants um all
those<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.180> rogue<00:02:33.920> assassins<00:02:34.920> might

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
those you know rogue assassins might

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.860 
those you know rogue assassins might
have<00:02:35.370> picked<00:02:35.670> his<00:02:35.820> body<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.450> done<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
have picked his body up and done a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.440 
have picked his body up and done a
proper<00:02:37.200> ceremonial<00:02:37.830> burial<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.400> his<00:02:38.580> body<00:02:38.850> but

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
proper ceremonial burial of his body but

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.000 
proper ceremonial burial of his body but
I<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> hint<00:02:40.830> by<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
I think that this is a hint by the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.130 
I think that this is a hint by the
developers<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.760> racial<00:02:42.510> Ghul<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.780> still<00:02:43.020> out

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
developers that racial Ghul is still out

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.710 
developers that racial Ghul is still out
there<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.790> intrigued<00:02:45.540> by<00:02:45.660> this

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
there so if you are intrigued by this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.210

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
single one of these it's very

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.540 
single one of these it's very
interesting<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.040> there's<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.220> lot<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.430> little

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
wouldn't get otherwise just by playing

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.190 
wouldn't get otherwise just by playing
the<00:02:59.340> story<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.880> any<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.570> three<00:03:00.720> games<00:03:00.959> so
