just<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.240> little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:49.520> okay<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.580> it's<00:00:51.180> starting

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
just a little bit okay so it's starting

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020

to<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> point<00:00:52.380> now<00:00:52.560> where<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.670> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to get to the point now where I can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.280 
to get to the point now where I can
barely<00:00:54.210> even<00:00:54.450> touch<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> water<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
barely even touch the water in the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.480 
barely even touch the water in the
inside<00:00:55.560> that's<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:56.040> nice<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.250> warm

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
inside that's getting nice and warm

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.319 
inside that's getting nice and warm
which<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.450> good<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:59.040> only<00:00:59.160> bad<00:00:59.790> part<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
which is good the only bad part is that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
which is good the only bad part is that
most<00:01:00.810> of<00:01:01.020> my<00:01:01.050> firewood<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.829> picked<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
most of my firewood that I picked up is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
most of my firewood that I picked up is
really<00:01:03.240> dry<00:01:03.540> it's<00:01:04.470> probably<00:01:04.739> been<00:01:04.829> sitting

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
really dry it's probably been sitting

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
really dry it's probably been sitting
around<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> ground<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.570> quite<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> while

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
around on the ground for quite a while

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
around on the ground for quite a while
and<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.770> burned<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.130> quite<00:01:08.400> quickly<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and it's burned up quite quickly and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.789 
and it's burned up quite quickly and
this<00:01:09.600> wind<00:01:09.840> isn't<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.229> helping<00:01:10.530> either

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this wind isn't really helping either

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.490 
this wind isn't really helping either
but<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> top<00:01:13.110> I'm

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
but you can see here in the top I'm

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
but you can see here in the top I'm
starting<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> little<00:01:14.759> bit<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> bubbling

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
starting to get a little bit of bubbling

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.980 
starting to get a little bit of bubbling
going<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:17.360> it's<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.960> know

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
going which is good it's the you know

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
going which is good it's the you know
starting<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.040> simmer<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.030> little

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

bit<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.110> getting<00:01:22.380> close<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> point

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
bit but it's getting close to that point

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
bit but it's getting close to that point
and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.940> before<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.420> know<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:24.870> gonna
