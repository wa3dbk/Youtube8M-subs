00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
some of the burberry make up with you I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
some of the burberry make up with you I
never<00:00:38.309> thought<00:00:38.430> I'd<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:38.850> love<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.329> as

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
never thought I'd actually love it as

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
never thought I'd actually love it as
much<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.710> mean<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.280> price<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.969> was

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
much as I do I mean the price of it was

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.490 
much as I do I mean the price of it was
something<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.510> was<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> bit<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.350> know

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
something that was a bit you know

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
something that was a bit you know
keeping<00:00:44.280> me<00:00:44.520> away<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.730> buying<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
keeping me away from buying it but I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.520 
keeping me away from buying it but I
figured<00:00:46.430> price<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> pay<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.300> quality<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
figured price you pay is for quality so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.610 
figured price you pay is for quality so
why<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.370> try<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.469> me

as for whether it helps my foundations
stay<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> longer<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:52.140> not<00:01:52.259> too<00:01:52.500> sure<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.159> can't

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.880 
stay on longer I'm not too sure I can't
really<00:01:54.329> notice<00:01:54.509> any<00:01:54.899> difference<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> makes

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
really notice any difference that makes

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429

make<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.680> break<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.070> didn't<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.549> anything

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
make me break out didn't do anything

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
make me break out didn't do anything
negative<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.570> also<00:02:00.719> didn't<00:02:01.170> seem<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> do

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
negative but it also didn't seem to do

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.410 
negative but it also didn't seem to do
anything<00:02:01.829> positive<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.909> feels<00:02:03.149> nice

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
anything positive it just feels nice

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.830 
anything positive it just feels nice
almost

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

backup so i'm going to be using that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.449 
backup so i'm going to be using that
anyway<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.830> not<00:02:10.950> something<00:02:11.160> out

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
anyway so it's not something out

so I had the choice of this one or their

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.970 
so I had the choice of this one or their
other<00:02:18.690> foundation<00:02:19.379> which<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.620> believe<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.830> just

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
other foundation which I believe is just

other foundation which I believe is just
called<00:02:20.370> sheer<00:02:20.879> glow<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.510> can't<00:02:21.810> remember<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.349> be

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
called sheer glow I can't remember to be

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.289 
called sheer glow I can't remember to be
honest<00:02:22.769> but<00:02:23.040> um<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.459> chose<00:02:23.849> this<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.239> because

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
honest but um I chose this one because

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.970 
honest but um I chose this one because
it<00:02:24.480> has<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.660> bit<00:02:24.810> more<00:02:24.959> coverage<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.680> other<00:02:25.830> one

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it has a bit more coverage the other one

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.759 
it has a bit more coverage the other one
didn't<00:02:26.640> provide<00:02:27.000> anything<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.780> me<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.110> don't

didn't provide anything for me I don't
really<00:02:28.890> need<00:02:29.099> coverage<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.150> at

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
really need coverage and I like to at

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.930 
really need coverage and I like to at
least<00:02:30.360> look<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.870> my<00:02:31.049> face<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.500> even<00:02:32.069> even<00:02:32.790> out

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
least look like my face is even even out

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.089 
least look like my face is even even out
intoned<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:34.440> one<00:02:34.560> does<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.739> really<00:02:34.890> good<00:02:35.040> job

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
intoned this one does a really good job

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.220 
intoned this one does a really good job
it<00:02:35.459> covers<00:02:35.730> really<00:02:36.030> well<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.690> cakey

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
it covers really well but it's not cakey

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.440 
it covers really well but it's not cakey
and<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.890> also<00:02:38.040> matches<00:02:38.310> my<00:02:38.610> skin<00:02:38.670> tone<00:02:38.880> perfect

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and it also matches my skin tone perfect

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.030 
and it also matches my skin tone perfect
day<00:02:39.599> because<00:02:39.870> I'm<00:02:39.989> really<00:02:40.230> pale<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.769> I'm<00:02:40.860> more

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
day because I'm really pale and I'm more

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.970 
day because I'm really pale and I'm more
like<00:02:41.190> yellow<00:02:41.400> toned<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.720> 201<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.620> great

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
like yellow toned and the 201 is great

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.979 
like yellow toned and the 201 is great
so<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.579> sort<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.880> yellowish<00:02:45.510> fair

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
so if you have a sort of yellowish fair

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.500 
so if you have a sort of yellowish fair
skin<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:46.829> would<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:46.950> good<00:02:47.220> for<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.519> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
skin this one would be good for you and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.600 
skin this one would be good for you and
then<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.079> lightest<00:02:49.650> shade<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:50.280> their

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
then this is the lightest shade in their

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.490 
then this is the lightest shade in their
range<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.810> want<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.049> try<00:02:52.200> it's

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
range so if you want to try it's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.319 
range so if you want to try it's
probably<00:02:52.620> best<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.069> try<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.579> in<00:02:53.849> store<00:02:54.209> if

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
probably best to try one on in store if

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.960 
probably best to try one on in store if
you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.799> but<00:02:55.799> yeah<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.400> reference<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:56.849> your

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
you can but yeah for reference if your

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.970 
you can but yeah for reference if your
skin<00:02:57.120> looks<00:02:57.329> like<00:02:57.480> mine<00:02:57.720> toooo<00:02:58.349> what<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.829> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
skin looks like mine toooo what is the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.240 
skin looks like mine toooo what is the
one<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.250> get<00:03:00.079> so<00:03:01.079> say<00:03:01.349> coverage<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.890> probably

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
one to get so say coverage is probably

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.119 
one to get so say coverage is probably
medium<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.810> build<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.349> up<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.620> be<00:03:04.739> heavier

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
medium you can build it up to be heavier

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.009 
medium you can build it up to be heavier
but<00:03:05.519> again<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.060> don't<00:03:06.329> need<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.870> haven't

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
but again I don't need that so I haven't

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.979 
but again I don't need that so I haven't
really<00:03:07.110> bought<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.530> bother<00:03:07.859> trying<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.840> not

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
really bought it bother trying it's not

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.990 
really bought it bother trying it's not
very<00:03:10.139> light<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:11.069> light<00:03:11.310> coverage<00:03:11.760> so

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
very light it's not light coverage so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.879 
very light it's not light coverage so
for<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.389> one<00:03:12.569> I'd<00:03:12.690> get<00:03:12.900> there<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.769> other

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
for that one I'd get there the other

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.410 
for that one I'd get there the other
foundation<00:03:14.489> by<00:03:14.609> brewery<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.150> probably

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
foundation by brewery it's probably

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.050 
foundation by brewery it's probably
better<00:03:15.600> off<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:16.079> your<00:03:16.230> skin<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.940> what<00:03:17.940> else

darker<00:04:06.480> skins<00:04:06.810> they<00:04:07.079> don't<00:04:07.260> have<00:04:07.380> any<00:04:07.560> that

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
darker skins they don't have any that

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.830 
darker skins they don't have any that
would<00:04:07.919> go<00:04:08.099> well<00:04:08.130> sadly<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.419> hopefully<00:04:09.690> they

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
would go well sadly so hopefully they

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.010 
would go well sadly so hopefully they
change<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:11.400> picked<00:04:11.730> this

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
change that and I picked this

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.420 
change that and I picked this
for<00:04:12.200> myself<00:04:12.320> because<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.860> is<00:04:12.950> more<00:04:13.100> yellow

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
for myself because it is more yellow

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.760 
for myself because it is more yellow
toned<00:04:13.700> suits<00:04:14.570> my<00:04:14.780> skin<00:04:14.840> better<00:04:15.320> on<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.740> other

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
toned suits my skin better on the other

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.130 
toned suits my skin better on the other
one<00:04:16.010> was<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.130> bit<00:04:16.310> more<00:04:16.430> pinky<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:18.050> be

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
one was a bit more pinky and to be

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.720 
one was a bit more pinky and to be
honest<00:04:18.440> they're<00:04:18.590> both<00:04:18.739> about<00:04:18.860> the<00:04:19.010> same<00:04:19.100> level

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
honest they're both about the same level

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.050 
honest they're both about the same level
of<00:04:19.910> like<00:04:20.480> darkness<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:22.130> don't<00:04:22.700> know<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:22.910> don't

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
of like darkness so I don't know I don't

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.250 
of like darkness so I don't know I don't
know<00:04:23.150> who<00:04:23.300> they're<00:04:23.450> really<00:04:23.630> made<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.930> for<00:04:24.140> it

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
know who they're really made it for it

know who they're really made it for it
is<00:04:24.380> quite<00:04:24.590> transparent<00:04:24.950> so<00:04:25.430> may<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.730> make

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
is quite transparent so may not make

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.610 
is quite transparent so may not make
much<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.300> difference<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.720> people<00:04:27.050> but<00:04:27.260> they

much of a difference to people but they

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.100 
much of a difference to people but they
definitely<00:04:27.860> should<00:04:28.070> have<00:04:28.250> different<00:04:28.700> colors

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110

definitely should have different colors
it<00:04:30.110> looks<00:04:30.290> like<00:04:30.410> this<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:32.180> I'm<00:04:32.510> not<00:04:32.690> hard<00:04:33.080> to

every makeup try it I love it it's like
you'd<00:05:23.900> think<00:05:24.140> fashion<00:05:25.100> house<00:05:25.430> like<00:05:25.610> Burberry

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
you'd think fashion house like Burberry

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.730 
you'd think fashion house like Burberry

wouldn't really excel and makeup and I

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.800 
wouldn't really excel and makeup and I
think<00:05:27.980> they<00:05:28.070> do<00:05:28.130> even<00:05:28.610> better<00:05:28.760> than<00:05:29.120> say<00:05:29.450> some

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
think they do even better than say some

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.680 
think they do even better than say some
of<00:05:30.590> do<00:05:30.740> your<00:05:30.920> nails<00:05:31.310> products<00:05:31.820> but<00:05:32.150> if<00:05:32.510> it

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
of do your nails products but if it

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.270 
of do your nails products but if it
doesn't<00:05:32.840> do<00:05:33.080> better<00:05:33.410> I'd<00:05:33.710> say<00:05:33.920> they're<00:05:34.100> quite

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
doesn't do better I'd say they're quite

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.090 
doesn't do better I'd say they're quite
on<00:05:34.490> par<00:05:34.520> they're<00:05:35.210> very<00:05:35.390> equal<00:05:35.840> even<00:05:36.440> Tom<00:05:36.770> Ford

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
on par they're very equal even Tom Ford

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.520
