00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.270
 we print the downloaded model e 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.270
 cut out the hearts 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.809
 we report the outline of the heart that we are 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.559
 interested in a cardboard pressed from a 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.559
 millimeter 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.130
 then we cut out 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.189
 let's take some felt now and with the shape 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.640
 of the heart resting on it we cut out the 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:31.740
 shape if you prefer with a pencil 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 you can go over the outline 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.110
 now and we choose the fabric with which 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.110
 we will clothe the heart 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.320
 we place the cardboard template on top 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.930
 and go back over the outline leaving around 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.930
 4 centimeters of margin 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.489
 and cut out 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:48.769
 for the stuffing we can use the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:51.260
 foam rubber or even wadding 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.130
 which we need two layers of two 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.130
 centimeters 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.720
 now with hot glue we glue to the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.220
 cardboard shape 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 the two layers of cotton wool 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:48.950
 then we put the heart on the fabric 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:51.050
 upside down with the cardboard facing upwards e 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.500
 with hot glue bend and 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.940
 we glue the fabric to the cardboard in 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.820
 this way we remember not to pull 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:20.870
 too much fabric to not flatten the 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:25.240
 heart in the central part at the top 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.240
 instead we pull with more strength 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.669
 we apply a satin ribbon in the center 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.669
 to be able to hang it 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.530
 let's take some lace now 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.330
 and folding it over itself every other 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.620
 centimeters 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.620
 we create a contour 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.070
 at this point we can use the felt 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.760
 clipped first to close the back 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.760
 of the heart 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.800
 or as in this case create a 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.220
 second half of the heart for an effect 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.220
 three-dimensional 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.600
 we can also decorate the destination with 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.600
 lace and string 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.890
 so finally we glue them together 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.890
 two parts 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.180
 and the heart is finished 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.870
 and here are all the variations 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.620
 next time and good work
