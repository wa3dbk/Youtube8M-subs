 hello youtube friends today I will inform you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.330
 about two things that are from the versions 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.820
 of ios and the jailbreak for you to stay 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.350
 to watch this video I will not do it very long 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.690
 so that you do not take much time 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.840
 The first thing I want to talk about is the 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.520
 new version of ios 6.0 point 1 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.040
 obviously we all have that version 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.980
 on our apple devices but 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.980
 recently the 6.0 point version came out 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.320

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.629
 ipad mini because only for these 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.450
 two devices will ask then 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.250
 this use went out as you know they are the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.739
 last devices that came out of the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.050
 apple company they came with some 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.970
 flaws of the wifi and with this version the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.750
 arranged for that is that only 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.510

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.650

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.270
 brick have for 6 points 0.1 the unted and 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.700
 we are not very sure when it will come out 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.030
 but we are sure that obviously 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.750
 will come out in 2013 we do not expect anything this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.570
 year to the next 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.630
 and as you know we are already in the version 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.110
 6.0 point 1 but for the designers already 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.850
 we are in version 6.1 beta 4 this 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.090
 it means that she will leave on 6.1 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.369
 official to the public very very soon and 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.710
 maybe the jove for this in all the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.430
 devices since it is iphone 4 iphone 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.050
 3g and ipod touch fourth generation and the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.159
 who follow these ie newest 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.469
 but still nothing is certain 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.450
 and well this was pretty much everything 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.549
 I wanted to tell you that I do not think 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 will be for these times so that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.250
 do not go looking for videos on youtube and not 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.920
 waste your time 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.280
 I want to inform you that the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.950
 very soon 6.1 is changed on 6.2 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.810
 it came out but not for everyone to be 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.090
 informed about this world of apple and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.369

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.420
