00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello such a greeting and welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.820
 I am they are more lenient watching this video we will see 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.739
 a young Saharawi in Brussels that happened in the military archives 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.869
 Jews 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.359
 of the programs that we open 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.599
 which the most r our ram memory 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.599
 and good occupy the necessary space 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.390
 could serve to work on the applications that we are working on 

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:31.179
 the moment 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.760
 and good is the solution to this continues to make direct downloads of memory 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.310
 with programs like 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.660
 memo and mechanics 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.510
 they remember in another video that and not stay off the hook 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.400
 the corrupt client files that are not occupied and good if you choose a 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.930
 solution 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.050
 with programs 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.610
 and good in this video 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 let's see how to fix it in another way 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 in which is creating a value in the windows registry 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.410
 thus forces three points without the need of the temple but loves 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 from them to these memory downloads 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 and good 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 in this way we will be able to 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.050
 work faster our computer 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
 and well for that we are going to do the following 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.780
 let's go mission we select 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.250
 run 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.810
 showed alders 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 once we made people enrolled in their helmet we tightened the pools 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.340
 finally buried 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 elche editor of the registry we will move them with the following chains 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.420
 which is being dedicated a description of the video so that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.970
 have 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.890
 once here we are going to go to jail after we knew months 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.570
 southwest 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.070
 if here we are going to look for the folder called teachers 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.469
 very well we move it 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:09.639
 and here we have 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.639
 Oscar the certainty and demands 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:18.029
 we were to move it again they found the folder 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.989
 concurrent talks we move 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.649
 and well let's do it select the fight explorer folder without judging them 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.309
 iihs 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.739
 Ok here 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.449
 let's give right click we select 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.559
 new and I choose alphanumeric value 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.769
 Well, once this is done, let's write the next ball 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.099
 which is leaving them in the description for here 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.829
 those who do not have 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.589
 have no problem 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.589
 we activate write 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.749
 colby lewis 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.269
 tel does not 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.269
 tíflis the exile 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.000
 in 2009 the Romans are expected 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 owens a sterile debate of l we accept 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.679
 and let's see where about that to modify guillén that the value of this 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:15.739
 same 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.159
 very well here we are going to put dunlop 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.999
 and we are going to click on accept 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.129
 history census office we can close our our director of the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.279
 registration and good and what is next is to restart our team for Chile 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.729
 These two acts made changes 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.729
 in the windows registry there is an effect 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.229
 Well, once this is done 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.619
 we will notice that in our computer 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.749
 ng when it was working 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:54.319
 to expose a little better since he said he's occupying the percent files 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.980
 my previously open programs 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:02.679
 and well I hope you serve this video I am and I will be makintouch 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.449
 i do not have to leave a greeting 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:11.419
