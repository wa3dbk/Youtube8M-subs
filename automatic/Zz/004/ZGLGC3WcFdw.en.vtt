00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.919
 uploaded by me 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.320
 they will need employment 3 in order to have their 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.400
 speedometer but I'll leave it on 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.400
 description of the video 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.590
 You will see that the link is mine so I do not 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.590
 has a virus 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.879
 they wait for 45 or if they have 25 and 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.879
 they download it 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.220
 once downloaded the first thing we go 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.140
 to install is the kernel 3 I'm not going to 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.020
 install but I'll tell you how it comes with 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.940
 installer is very easy what we have 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.680
 what to do is open the kernel installer 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.680
 3 that is inside the file 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.840
 we describe and install I do not 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.340
 I install because I already have it but they have 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 what to put ninet and finish 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.880
 now the last thing we need is 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.880
 install the speedometer and ready to vitiate 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.180
 andreas 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.620
 when we open the sub folder is 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.230
 san andreas we open the folder kernel and 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.250
 we copy speed cs and paste it into the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.740
 folder I think 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.810
 I get copy and paste because I already 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.590
 I have installed and that's why I get that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.590

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.670
 now let's open models and we 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.530
 txt will appear we open it and copy and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.160
 winrar file that says blue we copy what 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.390
