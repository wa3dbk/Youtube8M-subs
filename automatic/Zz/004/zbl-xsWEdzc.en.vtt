00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.750
 I see something in my kitchen 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.960
 is this a tin can a box 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:16.220
 mailbox a metal box a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 bin b no it's a meat smoker 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 I already made a little video keith you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.180
 explain how did I smoke my 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.039
 vehicle ultimately excellent against 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 liked more or less details about 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 the smoking room as such 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.840
 so January the tuque to settle the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 problem 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.329
 so March 4 that you have in front of us 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 a galvanized steel metal bin 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.320
 obviously metal to not have any 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 place and that will melt 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.719
 so I took a medal-covered 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.739
 galvanic very important this the moment 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.379
 at the beginning of a video what the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.649
 investments 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.079
 I use an electrical element that is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.780
 mounts on a plastic case so 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 who is already his wish isolated to the heat 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.010
 all this to tell you that the company 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.159
 galvanized when overheated is going 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.040
 to release dena vapors very harmful 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 as many senestis as much under the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.119
 breathe that if his life in touch with 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
 the smoker's food so when you 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.740
 tell me I use an element 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.350
 electric so it gives off the heat 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.720
 but not as much as this fake if you 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.880
 decide to do something like me but 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 with charcoal brief with real 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.689
 wrong beware 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.790
 it can overheat the trash good this 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.920
 being told we start I give you the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.310
 details how do you notice the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790
 trash can 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.640
 I still cuddle on amazes 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.260
 16 points 5 gallons so that's it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:57.270
 translated by 83 liters in total is 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.780
 in other words those already a very good 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.520
 enough amount of everything I did 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.720
 like predict the lid seems 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.080
 suffer from apnea 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.080
 but in reality these are nuts and 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.150
 metal washers I do not know 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.100
 how to say in French and if I 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.920
 returns for sailboats that inside 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.320
 I hung mourning so these are 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.870
 two there that are longer and I write 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.970
 why alain stas because with a 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.010
 meat smoker like mine I want 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
 look around 200 degrees celsius the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 scrap pardon so that allows me to 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.300
 cook at very low temperatures so 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.950
 a long time and for some pieces of 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.180
 meat like your site be it can 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.910
 to go for very good results 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.700
 thanks to that so what I do is that 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.730
 I take his metal rod which is 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.410
 just a metal stud that chenu 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.810
 cut the tip at the bevel and at the other 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.980
 tip makes a small steeple 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.880
 I just have the entry into the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.910
 first we are like that and then 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680
 others that I stole through the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.680
 piece of meat that I want to kill and 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.570
 to smoke and I then slip it into the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.260
 second to us so obviously when 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.720
 you look at this here soma metal rods 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.820
 theirs at thiviers here is fixed by 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.799
 the hooks and the other side the piece 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.310
 becomes so much a language too so 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.250
 roast go nowhere otherwise for 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.620
 the most piece of bacon sum meat 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.380
 we not pay that just clinched school 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.720
 shaped like this one of which I 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.120
 will just hung after 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.980
 covered and at the same time then move 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.500
 a simple two and then in the meat 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.400
 so it can hang on 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.200
 that's what i'm going to do i'm doing 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.910
 squeeze his praise of accelerated souls because 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.470
 that I show you I have already passed 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.140
 movement senses it so well 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.300
 ayse kept in the bottom of the trash I 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.820
 simply made a hole for 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.450
 let the electrical wire of my 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.880
 heating element and its two goals here 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.260
 it's connected to two metal bars 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.310
 you may not see very well but 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.050
 here and here 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.000
 this metal bar that allows me to 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.710
 put my shield which is an old 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.870
 metal plate for cooking 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.060
 so I'd like to ask here in the background 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.260
 and that prevents the group from being banned or 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.490
 it does not matter the meat of listened on 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.090
 this is the essential 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.890
 the other component is the machine to 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.820
 smoke so as I said it's a 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.040
 electric element 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.240
 I simply bought no young 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.870
 tailor a round equivalent of a 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.220
 stove and I simply put 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.610
 metal container with me chips from 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.340
 wood on top this burner the discomfort 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.270
 will be deposited in the bottom of my trash and the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.700
 you're done 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.740
 so this being said that concludes the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.350
 confection of my choice I will go out 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:55.110
 it outside as soon as possible 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:05:08.430
 before you die asphyxiation so here is a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:09.360
 little moment that we can see it moves 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.820
 Verry much 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.729
 so in this trash the water is not 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.970
 very well we will fill on two 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.400
 books my god like my apartment 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.640
 I do not know if they could see him there 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.440
 there is a slut everywhere dapper 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.990
 so here are the last details only 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.150
 lid when I deposited 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.949
 I have a hole here next to the handle that 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.539
 has no mourning and inside 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.780
 found was pretty simple it's 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.569
 why judge my temperature which I 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.919
 do not like my meat masson and seen 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.530
 that I am I am at a low temperature 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.139
 in my son I do not need a 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.330
 thermometer that will go up very very 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:54.470
 up this system to his 2 for meats 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.639
 if you mount on axis man at 190 Â° whose 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.900
 five years ahead being the last 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.090
 red dot here 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.889
 I have the equivalent of another 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.669
 red dot that a cache not my strong 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.870
 like that so that gives me about 220 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.690
 degrees fahrenheit 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.659
 so I'm not you here it is 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.159
 the machine the one in beirut 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:16.099
 it 's very good bacon that's what 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.509
 I have made pork chicken 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.710
 beef 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.009
 it does not hurt everything you 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.069
 want to follow a little imagination so 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.389
 comment give me your opinion on my 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:31.150
 boyfriend and I what you think 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.150
 and here's thanks hi
