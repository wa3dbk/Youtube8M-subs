00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 my friends and welcome to the next 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 follow here at the sochi 2014 olympia 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.580
 special and yes we continue with the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.340
 German chances on 9 February so 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.039
 now on sunday morning day 2 there is 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.260
 a total of eight gold medals so eight 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.660
 decisions here the first one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.320
 Decision will be made directly at eight o'clock 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 were morning at the departure of the Lords 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 By the way , everything runs on zdf and the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 The departure of the gentleman is on here 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.250
 unfortunately we do not know if we 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.440
 somehow German also start in the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 But the chances will be finale 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 are zero so the other teams 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 have much better chances here and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.800
 that will probably be nothing for us 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 have some more 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.510
 Decisions where it will be something 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.050
 and yes the first maybe directly 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.030
 here's snowboard slopestyle 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.320
 The Lisa Zimmermann in the extended 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.710
 circular favorites 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.390
 the best german silvia mittermüller 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 unfortunately could not participate in such 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.010
 since she's just injured that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 by the way, already at 7:30 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 since will then decide 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.610
 even in the final at 10 o'clock 15 here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 is at 11 o'clock then we have the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.450
 cross-country skiing the ski eagle of the men instead 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.630
 then I have everything in you already 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.040
 the previous follow tells what 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.070
 What is here is the 15 kilometer 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.350
 with classic course and 15 km with 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.650
 This skating technique is the freestyle 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.930
 so tab tobias angerer is here really 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.270
 Being in very good shape has good chances 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 on a medal and even gold is 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 while petter northug here of course 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.149
 then small adds and the performance 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.409
 but is not the medal chances 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.390
 are very very good 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.310
 and we also go with it 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.700
 I'm satisfied with 80 percent silver 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.820
 here at 12:30 then the first 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 occurs the speed skating ladies 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.439
 Claudia Pechstein also starts here 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.479
 the longer discipline also has good 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.759
 chances are still there 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.400
 outsider chances though 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 better than nothing about just above 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.299
 That's just over 50 percent 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.349
 this is a medal there would be yes 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:22.349
 Well then we have at 15 30 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.930
 biathlon 75 km sprint the ladies and the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.329
 biathlon is unfortunately our care child 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.129
 here at the olympic games that was 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.060
 always a very strong one in the past 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.099
 discipline of the German meanwhile is 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.680
 it's kind of deteriorating that way 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.299
 But it is also because that some 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.859
 German athletes then also injured 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.650
 are 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:47.099
 right here with the ladies is here now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.150
 I'm not on the name white 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.190
 I'm not sorry right now 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.379
 but you already know who I mean the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.609
 unfortunately can not start 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.040
 injury caused by miriam gössner 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.780
 it is the same as they are 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.730
 Probabilities already 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.629
 a little bigger that one here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.549
 medal would take away at 16 o'clock then 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.280
 figure skating in the team final 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.650
 dance the first disciplines or the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.859
 the first runs were already in the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.160
 I have been meeting since the 6th of february 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.109
 already and yes here are the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.970
 international other teams actually 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.129
 so a little better, I guess 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.230
 that the Germans here look it up 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.459
 we have on 25 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.650
 Probability that it is a medal 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:34.169
 there are then sledding at 17 clock 40 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.019
 by the way, the third run already at 15 o'clock 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.940
 30 and today were already the runs 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.760
 1 and 2 I do not know like that 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.949
 results are why I had to 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.590
 Now stick to it like two days 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.849
 Before that is because I always have to 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.359
 two days before the record otherwise 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.370
 I can not do that at all 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.199
 sledging, we sure gold can 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.040
 Let's just say that for the women 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.079
 with the gentlemen 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.239
 We'll all be mine 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.959
 pretty sure that's why 100 percent 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.340
 that felix hole here the gold medal 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.169
 he really won everything 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.389
 has had most recently has become vancouver 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.879
 won eight times at a wm 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.919
 in the overall world cup so that really drives 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.370
 in his own league that is yes 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.900
 By the way, also the son of 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.919
 Bundestrainers and the ladies will 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.609
 probably not be different 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.189
 So top here 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.840
 the first golden maybe even the 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:28.840
 second role after what the other depending 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.129
 But there is definitely something here 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.530
 Gold then 18.30 we still have one 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.569
 little worried child of german that 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.039
 skis on the normal hill of 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.099
 Men's 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.840
 Of course that always depends on how 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.430
 the german then in form are so it 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.900
 must be better in any case than 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.810
 at the Four Hills Tournament now at 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.469
 sat there in between the competitions 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.389
 certainly not so bad from the 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.039
 he also has severin friend i believe 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.379
 even brought world cup or was 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.879
 already far ahead with the lay 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.889
 But I also believe that the top 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.169
 Favorites are not everywhere at the start 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.120
 the preparatory phase to olympia so 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.060
 now it definitely counts and if 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.860
 Here now a medal should come from 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.180
 we need two super jumps I am 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.219
 very curious what the Germans do 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.379
 would be nice if you are after the weak 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.719
 four hills tour again come back 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.719
 at olympia, yes tomorrow, then it goes 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.580
 continue with five gold medals 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:28.750
 decisions and I want it now 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.819
 not anticipate but there is also one 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.349
 medal more or less sure that 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.729
 I'll explain the rest to you tomorrow 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.650
 is then rather mixed 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.810
 who definitely beautiful if you the 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.469
 tomorrow at 21 o'clock again with it 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.330
 and then we look at each other like that 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.879
 probabilities for the monday are 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.500
 that the Germans get medals here 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.729
 if he liked the video 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.050
 very happy to thumb up that only lasts 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.669
 a second really helps me a lot 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.370
 Please feel free to leave a comment 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.770
 leave if anything else looks 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.689
 I am open for everything and would like to 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.789
 also share the video if your friends 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.370
 here as olympia are crazy as well 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.990
 we are beautiful who we see us 21 clock 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.990
 until then it'll be good
