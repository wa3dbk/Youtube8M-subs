astrobiologists Lynn Rothschild explains
the<00:00:48.329> reason<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.379> obliquity<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the reason we have this obliquity that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.569 
the reason we have this obliquity that
holds<00:00:50.820> steady<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.920> moon<00:00:53.160> helps

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
holds steady is because the moon helps

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400 
holds steady is because the moon helps
to<00:00:53.730> stabilize<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.719> obliquity<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> earth

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to stabilize the obliquity of the earth

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
to stabilize the obliquity of the earth

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
if we had no moon we would end up with

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
if we had no moon we would end up with
what<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> astronomers<00:00:58.559> call<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> chaotic
