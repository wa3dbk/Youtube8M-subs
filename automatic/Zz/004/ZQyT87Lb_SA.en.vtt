sharing and subscribing right now I was
learning<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.259> memory<00:00:04.799> we're<00:00:05.100> upgrading<00:00:05.549> my

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
learning about memory we're upgrading my

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.179 
learning about memory we're upgrading my
computer<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.230> told<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.950> is

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.379 
before you came along and I had to get a
video<00:00:10.860> card<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:12.090> I'm<00:00:12.210> already

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
video card right because I'm already

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.999 
video card right because I'm already
upgrading<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.110> if<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.290> upgrade<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.769> part

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
upgrading so if you upgrade one part

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.589 
upgrading so if you upgrade one part
usually<00:00:14.219> FF<00:00:14.700> grade<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> next<00:00:15.210> part<00:00:15.420> which<00:00:15.570> is

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
usually FF grade the next part which is

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.130 
usually FF grade the next part which is
also<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.350> video<00:00:16.590> right<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.869> whoever<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.109> on

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
trying to install my own memory this is

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
trying to install my own memory this is
scary<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.030> much<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.570> doing<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.960> yeah

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
scary that much I was doing this yeah
memory<00:00:40.500> memory<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.100> me<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> makes<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.940> but

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
memory memory of me that makes not but

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.060 
memory memory of me that makes not but
not<00:00:42.840> hard<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.350> were<00:00:43.410> keep<00:00:43.620> telling<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
not hard but they were keep telling me I

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
not hard but they were keep telling me I
had<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> add<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.969> things<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.960> started

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
had to add more things as as I started

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.360 
had to add more things as as I started
doing<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> memory<00:00:46.800> than<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> what

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
doing the memory than they're like what

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.860 
doing the memory than they're like what
you<00:00:47.489> need<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you need to do this to you because the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.299 
you need to do this to you because the
memories<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.320> run<00:00:49.440> separate<00:00:49.800> good<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.219> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
memories I can run separate good if you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
memories I can run separate good if you
don't<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.289> second<00:00:52.710> guy<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
don't do this so the second guy was on

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
don't do this so the second guy was on
the<00:00:53.129> phone<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.460> he's<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.760> he<00:00:54.210> did<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.570> tell

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the phone with he's like he did not tell

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
the phone with he's like he did not tell
you<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> buy<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.890> kitty<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.520> they

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.880 
is vista a TI is far more stable as far
more<00:01:32.250> mature<00:01:32.400> drivers<00:01:33.000> than<00:01:33.150> nvidia<00:01:33.329> does

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
more mature drivers than nvidia does

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
more mature drivers than nvidia does
okay<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> doesn't<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:36.030> does<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.150> mean

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
okay it doesn't what does that mean

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.380 
okay it doesn't what does that mean
mature<00:01:36.810> drivers<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:38.340> works<00:01:38.579> better<00:01:38.790> than<00:01:39.119> with

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
mature drivers it works better than with

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
working by the car windows works better

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
finding a low-budget video card so we

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.300 
finding a low-budget video card so we
started<00:02:04.350> talking<00:02:04.649> about<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
started talking about you know what a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.719 
started talking about you know what a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
video card is basically helps you render

video on the screen and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.140 
video on the screen and
cards<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.070> actually<00:02:11.340> very<00:02:11.460> important<00:02:11.910> beyond

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
video cards because the better video

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.680 
video cards because the better video

going to be able to support that lower
end<00:02:31.740> video<00:02:32.010> cards<00:02:32.220> won't<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.840> I've<00:02:33.960> got

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
end video cards won't so like I've got

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.170 
end video cards won't so like I've got
tool<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.650> mana<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.130> 30<00:02:35.400> inch<00:02:35.550> monitors<00:02:35.610> plugged

tool to mana to 30 inch monitors plugged
into<00:02:36.360> one<00:02:36.630> video<00:02:36.810> card<00:02:37.230> right<00:02:37.410> now<00:02:37.560> it's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
into one video card right now it's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
into one video card right now it's
because<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.550> video<00:02:38.820> card<00:02:39.090> supports

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
because that video card supports

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.750 
because that video card supports
something<00:02:39.900> called<00:02:40.080> dual<00:02:40.350> link<00:02:40.590> DVI<00:02:40.760> which

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
something called dual link DVI which

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.370 
something called dual link DVI which
basically<00:02:42.090> means<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:42.510> powerful<00:02:42.810> enough<00:02:43.020> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
basically means it's powerful enough to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.190 
basically means it's powerful enough to
run<00:02:44.100> monitor<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:45.150> big<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> reckless

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
run monitor this big this is reckless

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.020 
run monitor this big this is reckless
it's<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.310> size<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> monitors

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
it's not just the size of the monitors

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.490 
it's not just the size of the monitors
it's<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.360> resolution<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.140> monitors

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
it's the resolution of the monitors

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.020 
it's the resolution of the monitors
there's<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.740> lot<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.920> pixels<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.460> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
there's a lot of pixels that the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.550 
there's a lot of pixels that the
computer<00:02:51.630> has<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:52.020> able<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> manage<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
computer has to be able to manage and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.170 
computer has to be able to manage and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
higher and video cards going to be able

higher and video cards going to be able
to<00:02:54.240> take<00:02:54.390> advantage<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.200> had<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.890> make

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
to take advantage of that I had to make

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.890 
to take advantage of that I had to make
sure<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.460> before<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> had<00:02:57.030> these<00:02:57.240> monitors<00:02:57.690> or

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
sure that before I had these monitors or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.090 
sure that before I had these monitors or
before<00:02:58.110> i<00:02:58.170> got<00:02:58.290> these<00:02:58.410> monitors<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
before i got these monitors that the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.860 
before i got these monitors that the
video<00:02:59.490> card<00:02:59.730> or<00:02:59.940> video<00:03:00.180> cards<00:03:00.540> would<00:03:00.600> be<00:03:00.750> able

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
video card or video cards would be able

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.770 
video card or video cards would be able
to<00:03:00.990> support<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> i<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.760> question<00:03:02.970> sure<00:03:03.390> so

if you upgrade your video card you get
this<00:03:06.180> like<00:03:06.360> awesome<00:03:06.960> video<00:03:07.230> card<00:03:07.590> because

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
this like awesome video card because

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.830 
this like awesome video card because
there's<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.490> much<00:03:08.610> more<00:03:08.940> information<00:03:09.690> being

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840

equally fast processor or do you have to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.620 
equally fast processor or do you have to
upgrade<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.670> processor<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.480> upgrade

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
upgrade the processor when you upgrade

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.480 
upgrade the processor when you upgrade
the<00:03:15.900> video<00:03:16.170> card<00:03:16.530> because<00:03:16.890> does<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.340> to

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
the video card because does it have to

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.820 
the video card because does it have to
move<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.940> information<00:03:18.660> yeah<00:03:19.020> well<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
move that information yeah well the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740 
move that information yeah well the
beauty<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.730> video<00:03:20.940> card<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.600> off

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
beauty of the video card is that it off

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
beauty of the video card is that it off
loads<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.650> lot<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.840> working<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:26.640> offloads

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
loads a lot of that working it offloads

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.690 
loads a lot of that working it offloads
a<00:03:27.120> lot<00:03:27.270> of<00:03:27.390> them<00:03:28.100> have<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.460> say<00:03:29.550> this

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
a lot of them have I going to say this

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.400 
a lot of them have I going to say this
I'll<00:03:30.150> try<00:03:30.270> I'm<00:03:30.480> trying<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.720> put<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.930> into

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
I'll try I'm trying to put this into

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.060 
I'll try I'm trying to put this into
something<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.830> you're<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
something that you're going to

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.040 
something that you're going to
understand<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> cpo<00:03:33.060> CPU<00:03:33.690> does<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.870> lot<00:03:33.990> of

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
understand so the cpo CPU does a lot of

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.540 
understand so the cpo CPU does a lot of
computing<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.530> does<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.860> processing<00:03:35.460> it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
computing it does the processing it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.490 
computing it does the processing it
figures<00:03:36.000> everything<00:03:36.240> out<00:03:36.420> having<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.350> video

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
figures everything out having a video

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.920 
figures everything out having a video
card<00:03:37.910> having<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.000> extra<00:03:39.150> hardware<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.750> takes

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
card having this extra hardware it takes

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
card having this extra hardware it takes
a<00:03:40.020> lot<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> load<00:03:40.500> off<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.830> cpu<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.490> puts<00:03:41.670> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
a lot of load off the cpu and puts it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.650 
a lot of load off the cpu and puts it
onto<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> video<00:03:42.360> card<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:44.010> theory<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.390> can

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
onto the video card so in theory you can

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.760 
onto the video card so in theory you can
upgrade<00:03:45.810> your<00:03:45.990> video<00:03:46.320> card<00:03:46.530> without

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
upgrade your video card without

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.380 
upgrade your video card without
necessarily<00:03:46.950> having<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.460> upgrade<00:03:47.580> your<00:03:48.000> CPU

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
necessarily having to upgrade your CPU

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.930 
necessarily having to upgrade your CPU
at<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.570> same<00:03:48.720> time<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.740> that<00:03:49.770> being<00:03:50.010> said<00:03:50.280> you

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
at the same time and that being said you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000 
at the same time and that being said you
know<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.630> course<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.020> faster<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> CPU<00:03:52.800> goes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
know of course the faster the CPU goes

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.290 
know of course the faster the CPU goes
the<00:03:53.280> faster<00:03:53.430> your<00:03:53.730> system<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.240> be

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
the faster your system is going to be

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.430 
the faster your system is going to be
the<00:03:54.390> more<00:03:54.480> responsive<00:03:54.990> it's<00:03:55.110> going<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.350> be

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
the more responsive it's going to be

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.960 
the more responsive it's going to be
you're<00:03:56.070> going<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.280> be<00:03:56.340> bottlenecked<00:03:56.700> by

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
you're going to be bottlenecked by

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.180 
you're going to be bottlenecked by
something<00:03:57.270> and<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.750> bottleneck<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.620> piece<00:03:58.920> or

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
something and a bottleneck is a piece or

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.620 
something and a bottleneck is a piece or
component<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.940> your<00:04:00.030> system<00:04:00.330> that's<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
component of your system that's the

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.930 
component of your system that's the
slowest<00:04:00.990> flavor<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:02.040> now<00:04:02.460> it's<00:04:02.700> getting<00:04:02.880> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
slowest flavor so now it's getting to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.980 
slowest flavor so now it's getting to
the<00:04:02.970> point<00:04:03.030> where<00:04:03.240> hard<00:04:03.600> drives<00:04:03.840> are

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
the point where hard drives are

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.150 
the point where hard drives are
typically<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.440> bottom<00:04:04.680> line<00:04:04.800> because<00:04:05.010> it's

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
typically the bottom line because it's

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.470 
typically the bottom line because it's
physical<00:04:05.520> media<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:06.060> something<00:04:06.330> that's

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
physical media it's something that's

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.330 
physical media it's something that's
writing<00:04:06.690> something<00:04:07.590> that's<00:04:07.800> moving<00:04:07.950> around

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
writing something that's moving around

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.980 
writing something that's moving around
it's<00:04:08.640> all<00:04:08.910> your<00:04:09.060> data<00:04:09.240> sits<00:04:09.480> on<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.780> got<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
it's all your data sits on it's got to

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.190 
it's all your data sits on it's got to
be<00:04:10.050> pulled<00:04:10.290> from<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.360> for<00:04:12.360> years<00:04:12.570> memory

able to take advantage of a faster cpu

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.300 
able to take advantage of a faster cpu
but<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.620> don't<00:04:32.800> necessarily<00:04:32.860> have<00:04:33.190> to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
but you don't necessarily have to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.590 
but you don't necessarily have to
upgrade<00:04:33.460> your<00:04:33.670> cpu<00:04:34.030> at<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> same<00:04:34.300> time<00:04:34.450> you

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
upgrade your cpu at the same time you

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.990 
upgrade your cpu at the same time you
upgrade<00:04:34.870> your<00:04:34.930> video<00:04:35.230> card<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:36.160> question<00:04:36.550> was

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
upgrade your video card the question was

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.990 
upgrade your video card the question was
driven<00:04:37.600> towards<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.260> budget<00:04:38.890> video<00:04:39.370> card<00:04:39.730> and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
driven towards a budget video card and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.290 
driven towards a budget video card and
the<00:04:40.660> way<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.810> always<00:04:41.080> approach<00:04:41.410> video<00:04:41.680> cards<00:04:42.040> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the way I always approach video cards is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.970 
the way I always approach video cards is
get<00:04:43.300> whatever<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.050> can<00:04:44.230> afford<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.590> get<00:04:44.740> and

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
get whatever you can afford to get and

what we did was we went out and got a

what we did was we went out and got a

but<00:05:26.710> hundred<00:05:27.130> dollars<00:05:27.430> or<00:05:27.550> whatever<00:05:27.790> but<00:05:28.120> that

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
but hundred dollars or whatever but that

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.940 
but hundred dollars or whatever but that
