so<00:00:02.540> what<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.720> preparing<00:00:04.470> for<00:00:05.190> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
so what we're preparing for the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.660 
so what we're preparing for the
freescale<00:00:06.509> Technology<00:00:07.080> Forum<00:00:07.319> next<00:00:07.649> week<00:00:07.799> we

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
freescale Technology Forum next week we

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.970 
freescale Technology Forum next week we
thought<00:00:08.820> we'd<00:00:08.940> take<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.090> moment<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.630> just<00:00:10.080> show

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
thought we'd take a moment and just show

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980 
thought we'd take a moment and just show

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
actually does you know take up pretty

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
actually does you know take up pretty

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
GStreamer and a 1080p video but you can

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.499 
GStreamer and a 1080p video but you can
see<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.390> cores<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.590> idle

see that the the other cores are idle
they<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:30.900> together<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.920> camera

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
they also put together a little camera

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.230 
they also put together a little camera
application<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.090> it's

got gauges that allow you to see what

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.969 
got gauges that allow you to see what
the<00:01:51.930> CPU<00:01:52.320> utilization<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.860> there

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the CPU utilization is and then there

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.149 
the CPU utilization is and then there
are<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> number<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> other<00:01:56.700> demos<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.390> just

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
are a number of other demos here just

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.440 
are a number of other demos here just
showing<00:01:59.159> other<00:01:59.430> things<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
showing other things this this is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.719 
showing other things this this is
actually<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:00.869> interesting<00:02:01.049> demo<00:02:01.579> that<00:02:02.579> you'll

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
actually an interesting demo that you'll

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.280 
actually an interesting demo that you'll
probably<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> lot<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
framework that's very easy to to produce

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.440 
framework that's very easy to to produce
content<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:30.420> makes<00:02:31.140> use<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
content for and it makes use of the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.020 
content for and it makes use of the
OpenGL<00:02:33.560> implementation<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.100> imx6

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
OpenGL implementation on the imx6

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.940 
OpenGL implementation on the imx6
it's<00:02:36.690> got<00:02:36.810> various<00:02:37.110> features<00:02:37.530> such<00:02:37.770> as<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
it's got various features such as a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.330 
it's got various features such as a
framerate<00:02:38.370> test<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:41.070> here

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
framerate test so you can here see here

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.830 
framerate test so you can here see here
that<00:02:41.490> we're<00:02:41.640> seeing<00:02:41.880> over<00:02:41.970> 100<00:02:42.420> frames<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that we're seeing over 100 frames a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.290 
that we're seeing over 100 frames a
second<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:45.350> again<00:02:46.350> really<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.250> just

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
second of again really just this is just

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.240 
second of again really just this is just
GPU<00:02:48.300> exercise<00:02:49.250> at<00:02:50.250> 720p<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:52.980> also<00:02:53.100> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
GPU exercise at 720p there are also a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.130 
GPU exercise at 720p there are also a
couple<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.730> demos<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:56.209> they<00:02:57.209> were<00:02:57.330> produced<00:02:57.990> by

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
couple of demos of they were produced by

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.570 
couple of demos of they were produced by
Vivante<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.760> showcase<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.300> power<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.020> the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
Vivante to showcase the power of the

Vivante to showcase the power of the
graphics<00:03:02.580> processing<00:03:03.000> unit<00:03:03.980> really<00:03:04.980> mostly

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
graphics processing unit really mostly

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.330 
graphics processing unit really mostly
just<00:03:05.900> animated<00:03:08.510> renderings<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.220> we're

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
just animated renderings and then we're

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.520 
just animated renderings and then we're
showing<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.670> couple<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.000> other<00:03:12.140> things<00:03:13.140> here

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
showing a couple of other things here

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.620 
showing a couple of other things here
demos<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.340> cute<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.300> QTE<00:03:16.100> WebKit<00:03:17.100> browser

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
demos of cute of the QTE WebKit browser

there's a very full-featured html5
browser<00:03:31.519> we've<00:03:32.519> got<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> link<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.540> time

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
browser we've got a link to the time

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.509 
browser we've got a link to the time
sets<00:03:34.140> web<00:03:34.320> site<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:34.739> well<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.680> we've<00:03:38.370> got

another webpage that shows basically
some<00:03:41.700> html5<00:03:42.650> graphics<00:03:43.650> rendering<00:03:44.540> again

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
some html5 graphics rendering again

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.680 
some html5 graphics rendering again
under<00:03:45.810> cube<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:47.400> we'll<00:03:48.150> be<00:03:48.269> showing<00:03:48.480> that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
