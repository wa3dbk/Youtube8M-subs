00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
with this the first thing we do it's all

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
with this the first thing we do it's all
visual<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> look<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> wine<00:01:01.230> what

visual we have to look at the wine what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
visual we have to look at the wine what
we're<00:01:02.219> looking<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.940> color<00:01:03.379> now

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
we're looking for here is color now

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
we're looking for here is color now
color<00:01:04.739> tells<00:01:05.129> us<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> lot<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.760> things<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
color tells us a lot of things about a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
color tells us a lot of things about a
one<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.260> start<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.799> first<00:01:08.159> part<00:01:08.490> if

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
one when we start at this first part if

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.270 
one when we start at this first part if
we're<00:01:09.150> assessing<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.380> about<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> wine

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
we're assessing it's about what the wine

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
we're assessing it's about what the wine
isn't<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.240> understand<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
isn't to understand what it is so I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
excellent okay so straight away all the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.340 
excellent okay so straight away all the
white<00:01:21.030> varieties<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.930> possibly<00:01:22.290> could

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
white varieties that this possibly could

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.580 
white varieties that this possibly could
be<00:01:22.680> we've<00:01:23.720> removed<00:01:24.720> from<00:01:25.049> our<00:01:25.229> thought

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
be we've removed from our thought

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
be we've removed from our thought
process<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.670> other<00:01:26.820> thing<00:01:27.060> we're<00:01:27.210> looking

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
process the other thing we're looking

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
process the other thing we're looking
for<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.689> impurities<00:01:28.350> within<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> wine<00:01:29.220> so

sediments<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.640> wine<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.240> sediment<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:54.869> be

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
sediments in a wine now sediment will be

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
sediments in a wine now sediment will be
dark<00:01:55.560> red<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.520> bits<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.820> pieces<00:01:57.210> and

dark red and little bits and pieces and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.819 
dark red and little bits and pieces and
it's<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.979> tannin<00:01:59.460> from<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> grapes

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
sediment is a good thing so but it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.539 
sediment is a good thing so but it
should<00:02:04.439> form<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> bottom<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> glass

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
should form in the bottom of the glass

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.530 
should form in the bottom of the glass
down<00:02:05.850> here

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
down here

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
in from the table here we swirl like

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.949 
in from the table here we swirl like
this<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:47.370> coat<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.850> side<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.330> glass<00:02:48.540> now

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
this to coat the side of the glass now

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.199 
this to coat the side of the glass now
coating<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.980> side<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> glass<00:02:50.550> give<00:02:51.090> us

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
coating the side of the glass give us

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.780 
coating the side of the glass give us
more<00:02:51.390> surface<00:02:51.900> area<00:02:52.050> which<00:02:52.890> allows<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.459> aroma

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
more surface area which allows the aroma

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.199 
more surface area which allows the aroma
to<00:02:54.300> escape<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.500> swirling<00:02:56.010> motion<00:02:56.160> also<00:02:56.610> sucks

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
to escape the swirling motion also sucks

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.290 
to escape the swirling motion also sucks
air<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.720> into<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.080> glass<00:02:58.670> again<00:02:59.670> giving<00:03:00.209> us

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
air down into the glass again giving us

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.290 
air down into the glass again giving us
the<00:03:00.450> ability<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.870> smell<00:03:01.020> more<00:03:01.350> okay<00:03:02.300> boiling

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
