00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
take a look through a frou-frou specs on

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.440 
take a look through a frou-frou specs on
this<00:00:49.260> product<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.070> has<00:00:50.100> slim<00:00:50.700> two<00:00:51.060> millimeter

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
this product it has slim two millimeter

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.080 
this product it has slim two millimeter
key<00:00:51.660> caps<00:00:51.930> allowing<00:00:52.320> faster<00:00:53.070> response<00:00:53.610> when

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
key caps allowing faster response when

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.550 
key caps allowing faster response when
you're<00:00:54.450> press<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.200> those<00:00:55.350> buttons

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
you're press and all those buttons

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.380 
you're press and all those buttons
basically<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.580> they<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.060> the<00:00:57.180> sense

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
basically I think they have the sense

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.120 
basically I think they have the sense
that<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.720> thinner<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.080> key<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.650> closer<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
that the thinner the key the closer is

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.470 
that the thinner the key the closer is
to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.400> button<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> quicker<00:01:00.330> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to the button so the quicker the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.990 
to the button so the quicker the
response<00:01:00.930> they're<00:01:01.380> basically<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.850> also

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
response they're basically now it also

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
response they're basically now it also
has<00:01:03.229> anti-ghosting<00:01:04.229> capabilities<00:01:04.949> which

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
has anti-ghosting capabilities which

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.249 
has anti-ghosting capabilities which
allows<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.939> 10<00:01:06.360> commands<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:07.020> once

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
allows you to have 10 commands at once

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.340 
allows you to have 10 commands at once
so<00:01:07.860> let's<00:01:08.070> say<00:01:08.390> you're<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.420> Counter<00:01:09.840> Strike<00:01:09.869> go
