00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 Speak, I'm a Rodrigo, and see. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.090
 we have here the second generation motogp with 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.700
 4g that was released in 2015 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.770
 3rd when that's the vote, people always 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 which came out last year but gave a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430
 Look now, just bring yellow that comes 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.960
 in the box is the only visual difference in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.609
 relation to model 3g and I 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 I particularly think that he is a baron. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 combine so much but finally the bowels 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.189
 they also changed almost nothing then 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 This means that you already know 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.469
 this device almost entirely is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.260
 the same memory processor are the same 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.980
 same cameras support two chips everything 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 equal 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.079
 only two points changed the first clear 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 now it supports the network 4g function 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 more than natural since even the motel is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.539
 supposedly faster connection than the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 second thing that is also very well 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.390
 coming is that the battery has been increased 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 while version 3g holds 2070 million 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.899
 for now the one with 4g takes 2390 moment 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 even though many people have 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 said that it is only enough to support 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 the additional consumption of 4g networks in my 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.869
 I realized that this is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.939
 an exaggeration and the battery of this 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.729
 here is considerably longer 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.530
 that the 3g version of download covering 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 and my conventional use of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.780
 applications he held about 16 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 hours being four hours and 40 minutes of 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 connected this when he accused the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 15 percent mark remaining 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.439
 when it arrived at 6 percent load I 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.540
 already had more than 17 hours of use being 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.400
 five hours and half screen on or 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.470
 it is a great brand that even 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.780
 approaches the second generation flex engine 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.270
 known for the good battery then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.210
 basically that same old button from 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.909
 war but now with 4 gb and battery that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.860
 yes it lasts longer for those who ask my 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.590
 general opinion on the device today 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.170
 I would say that it is not the intermediary 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.270
 market is not what it has. 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.159
 the best cameras is not the best either 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 Cheap but anyway it goes 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.299
 relatively well in all these 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.399
 technical aspects have these 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.899
 sounds that are cool and clear 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.179
 almost pure android offered by 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.670
 which is one of the great assets of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.200
 it's worth to buy 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.000
 a lot of personal taste even 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 often the citizen prefers to pay a 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.870
 little more and even lose a little bit of 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.630
 nothing in power to have the experience 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.670
 of use that is more pleasant and 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.040
 Overall it has an ok performance for the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.650
 intermediate nothing to complain also half 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.630
 exalt and end up getting stronger a bit 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 in comparison with engine is second 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 generation as it also has 4g and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.420
 very close battery then it may be the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.360
 best option for those who prefer the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.769
 big camera better with flash 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.590
 it was released for an absurd price 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.420
 near the house of 1000 worship but in 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.090
 online stores are already downloading bit and 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.930
 until getting close to the 3g version with tv 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.450
 digital 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.980
 so this one does not have digital tv only 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.160
 remembering are 16 gb of storage 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.440
 with expansion via micro sd card 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.480
 hence the intention of the video was only gives a 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.640
 quick update and talk a little about the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.739
 differences of this model I hope you 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.880
 have enjoyed it if you liked do not forget 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.260
 to click and enjoy 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.209
 if your first time here on the channel 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.380
 write that you follow the next 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.989
 on youtube videos 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.590
 follow me social networks and people talk a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.590
