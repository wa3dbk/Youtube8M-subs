00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.350
 congratulations the twente swimming championships but the three points of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.719
 I think this afternoon will be even more important 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.379
 the hand 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.549
 started badly 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.310
 weak in the competition I thought 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.680
 we have talked about it 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.759
 it's a good start 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.519
 so first of all there was no good on our part and second half was very good 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.619
 our side 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.109
 so important that I have the smoking group of the week already had that 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.309
 we will call the winter break again with six points or more so that is 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 well succeeded with also nice opportunity 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.760
 but coming back to the first half, it was perhaps the worst 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.860
 stavenisse in this first half of the season 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.990
 no I am already bad 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.230
 as another game out that what went into this morning's this morning knife 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.250
 the first half hour mainly 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.890
 well there were late everywhere and there 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.650
 yes not fanatic enough in which the duels 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.710
 if you could not come loose and saw in the fit it already started just look 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.090
 but to kick off that actually says enough 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.150
 the second half we have them talking about and the second half 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.630
 picked it up well 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.230
 despite being in a state of theirs it does not stand behind but it is such a shame 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.340
 and are for sale so much energy 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.010
 to the CIA if we do 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.250
 he scored chances, the chances always get the two fixed as well 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.100
 other nsc what have you discussed in the west with those guys that too 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 really one every once and then 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 we of course also speak certain institution 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.580
 and that it is not just that mvv year 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.020
 Based on that the better of the game has received us all 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.720
 as an asset in a certain struggle and have talked about it and have that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.780
 the second or well done 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.789
 and now with six points for jumps 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.289
 the Christmas period one 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.280
 and how nice is to thank the fans who will be with you just before Christmas because you will be 

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.370
 sung that does your personality 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.110
 and always i enjoy the audience 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.710
 it is a good interaction they saw that it was also difficult that it 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.319
 yes it was just bad and even the second afan drachten are 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.310
 although that beautiful goal made the centuries 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.630
 and a good year to see that it is a nice interaction and hopefully that 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.879
 says that saying 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.369
 until the end of the season 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.410
 because that is also the critical note of the public, a positive critical one 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.440
 note what they demand that at the end of the season you can hear that from the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.549
 grandstands do echo 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.400
 you have to become a champion yes but we are also very eager to promote and 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.179
 the top teams now seen who do everything but 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.709
 yes the real number one to name it so to win 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.329
 but well hopefully other tasks will get some boys back 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.599
 a rest now 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.319
 enjoy Christmas until a new year 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.319
 Rijswijk, good days are good year changes 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.940
 yes we will see each other again in 2015
