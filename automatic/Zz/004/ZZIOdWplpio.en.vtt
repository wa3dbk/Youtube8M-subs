 wonderful 3 especially since we are today 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.659
 talking about cults that have developed 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.090
 a cinch inside various games and the first 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.800
 what we want to talk about today 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.500
 tell this is an interesting project 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.890
 deduction from pokleva this is actually 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.030
 exactly what led us to create 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.270
 of this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.299
 strange video strange but very 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.039
 good I wonder what started as 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.380
 social experiment but 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.630
 turned into something bigger the most 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.730
 viewed stand on twitch in this 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 moment whose idea is quite simple 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.220
 three times starts pokemon happy 98 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.560
 years and and rts under accepts commands from 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780
 chat and knocks them battery that is 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.580
 it turns out that everyone who watches stream 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.160
 can play the same game 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.540
 pokemon and and here begins the most 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 interesting 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.760
 attempts to somehow influence the events of nerves 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 and expectations give rise to local memes that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.050
 add up to a whole religion 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.959
 there is a god and creator of all things and 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.090
 his prophets and the embodiment of universal evil 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.160
 in general at the moment it is possible 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.380
 write a whole story which i think 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.900
 we can even lay out individual files and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.900
 by the way in 16 days collective wisdom 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.700
 nevertheless passed pokemon red and on this 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 moment pores over the next generation 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.989
 let's see what it will bring to us 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.880
 you want to play tens of thousands 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.040

 h-what are you black in the epam church of children 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.769

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.959
 every atomic nucleus contains a whole 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.450
 the universe and therefore the division of the nucleus 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.549
 new universes of fans appear 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.620
 of this cult they think that I am cereal on 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.250
 which led to the world of Fallout current 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.660
 condition was damn good 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.430

 entities allowed many games but 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.340
 perhaps the most revealing talk about 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.530
