00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.250 
considering this question then we assume
the<00:05:21.890> above<00:05:22.100> is<00:05:22.280> true<00:05:22.310> if<00:05:23.140> acceptance<00:05:24.140> of

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
the above is true if acceptance of

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.470 
the above is true if acceptance of
Christ<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:24.680> necessary<00:05:25.160> for<00:05:25.340> salvation<00:05:25.490> then

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
Christ is necessary for salvation then

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.090 
Christ is necessary for salvation then

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
any religion that does not accept Christ

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.100

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
does not offer salvation and therefore

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.710 
does not offer salvation and therefore
useless<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:31.040> untrue<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:32.210> definition<00:05:32.690> of

useless and untrue the definition of

compatibility with other religions

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.320
