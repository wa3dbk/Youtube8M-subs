work<00:01:19.119> on<00:01:19.300> any<00:01:19.600> skin<00:01:20.050> tone<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.340> second

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
work on any skin tone so the second

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.380 
work on any skin tone so the second
color<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.300> knock<00:01:22.960> out<00:01:23.259> how<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.700> color<00:01:25.240> is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.330 
in it so I really really like this color
so<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.360> actually<00:02:57.570> went<00:02:57.840> through<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.590> swapped

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
so I actually went through and I swapped

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.220 
so I actually went through and I swapped
all<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> colors<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:01.050> how

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
all the colors because I like to see how

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.650 
all the colors because I like to see how
colors<00:03:01.560> look<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.890> their<00:03:02.040> dry<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.390> first

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
colors look in their dry and the first

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.090 
colors look in their dry and the first
kind<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.050> covering<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:04.680> last<00:03:04.890> color

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
kind is covering that's last color

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.229 
kind is covering that's last color
because<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.520> not<00:03:05.670> actually<00:03:05.970> part<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
because it's not actually part of the

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.780 
because it's not actually part of the
palette<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.650> first<00:03:07.950> color<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.670> color

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
palette so the first color is the color

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
palette so the first color is the color
that<00:03:08.910> i<00:03:09.030> have<00:03:09.270> on<00:03:09.480> which<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.930> really<00:03:10.410> nice
