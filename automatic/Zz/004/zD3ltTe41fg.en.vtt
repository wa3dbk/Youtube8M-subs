00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.390
 g This is a political expression 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.390
 Congress democracy . I would say democracy. 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.459
 In the end, this is the ultimate end of history, 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.540
 It can be called a product. 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:23.050
 Itguyo and we chose Examples 2-9 but the historical process of creating yogeoyi 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.600
 I have many roots in Spain and Portugal for example. 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.769
 Is not it time to catch some disciples too 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.879
 It's local, too. 0 minutes Revolution happens throughout the 17th century. 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:39.040
 Civil Revolution picked up the king from the dual yes 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:42.100
 Korea Civil War of the Revolution, written in the books, and then rise up and give 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.140
 So what we got was a civil class 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.660
 He was sovereign. 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.450
 Until then, the monarch was killed or the owner of the country , so to speak, 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.830
 I became the owner of the contrast . 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.510
 Like the past, every citizen has a policy to set a policy in the Joe viewing environment. 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.160
 Is not it? 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.940
 So who did kill a few handpicked the six expressions of poetry for the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.020
 In order to represent the region, it is basically an extension of the national sovereignty of direct democracy 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.370
 It's true. 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.810
 Because the people are picking that love, there is a concept that has created a citizen class 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.950
 More Than Possible 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.750
 Citizen planning and twinning is a country 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:29.660
 I like the country that what we are English and the stack from the enemy if you think the country 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.970
 You can go to all the countries in the narrow sense, or to the house. Jeonbukjae 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:37.610
 There is this and a general civil society. 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:41.600
 LA Was made to this Article accomplished yogeot This is the final product of Western Europe 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.150
 Specifically, the UK and France listen to countries that have undergone civil revolution. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 It is the purpose of this development model, Lee Mi-ja 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.429
 But by all means do so, but Western countries called civil society and the State 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.690
 I have a country that only develops so well that it develops well. 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.360
 Yes. 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:03.430
 Germany and Italy were leading when the domination of the Middle Ages in Europe 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.440
 The Italians and Italians begin writing in the 19th century as a country name. 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.070
 You can look at the name of the land. 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.640
 There were 3000 effects when I agreed. 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.050
 It's the same with 3000 cities . 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.100
 In fact, it is also the art. 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.190
 I wake up 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.840
 Politically, there 's nothing wrong with it. 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:29.430
 So they also hooked art cities of Italy, Kim and two other regions in Italy 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.920
 Became a supporter and such people became Shosha of art . 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.640
 So the rising technology is developing. 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.040
 Then , three hundred years later, our famous musicians will come in. 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.030
 France is not Britain by the 19th century, such as Ahmed Handel blouse what Brown 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.780
 It's a person, but Mozart Beethoven , German or Austrian. 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.620
 How come there's music did the talking as many consumers as 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.060
 Britain and France, where the territory was built quickly after 17 years of civil revolution 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.830
 Unlike the country that wrote it 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.280
 German and Italian city-state system. Oh, so still that politics 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:08.400
 I was not able to do this unification . 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.400
 Geojiman I not pray anyone interested in how the dwaeteuni What good would remove 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.560
 As I told you right now, 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:21.390
 Citizen's plan did not come up as a political sovereignty through the Civil Spirit 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.690
 Before that, countries such as Europe, Britain and Finland, 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 You like to help the tactics of alternatives across Europe 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.739
 Purely because of what I have contracted for a 1 ns college without espana 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.049
 Because of the river, Michiko still has two Latinos all Latin called Latin 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.799
 All get Spain 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.849
 Surprisingly , as I said last time, except for Brazil 1, 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:46.620
 Brazil has walked only this colonial port almost no hot water anyway UK 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:52.829
 Wrote late'm eaten in North America, for example, and then something new division of Africa 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:56.579
 Also I do not like doing right now is bust him on a long molding minutes and Africa 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.739
 Jakeunde Germany and Italy must come through a country-led form in the 19th century, ylang 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.730
 Memorize unified country 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:07.849
 So let 's slow down now that we're once a century's colonies . 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:12.379
 How about the three of them have already been appointed? 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.580
 Lots of islands are in fact sick with the poison of the South Pacific named recognizes poverty is keen eye 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.269
 Someone will do it. 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.190
 Do you know why? It happened late and I went colonizing the colony . 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.370
 I did not eat it, but I was selfish. 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.600
 Here in March, the army's small castle 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.710
 It's also an introduction. 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.880
 Keep the world behind Germany and Italy were back as a colony is divided 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.740
 I got into the market. 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:42.380
 So how do you ask for re-eruption to interfere with differentiation? 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:45.529
 So the challenge advanced imperial weeks, starting imperialist countries 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.759
 So it 's the First World War. 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:53.899
 Oh, we've reorganized the world . 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.939
 Germany, of course. 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:59.719
 So it's Trooper's Turkey . 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:01.549
 Here again, once in Germany. 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:07.239
 It will be the Italian clerk. 

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:07.239
 Italy is also close to the original heard the turn of the weakness seen the way the UK 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.450
 Solving such an option only after domestic requirements here moon told the Yugoslav side gusset 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.140
 There is 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.950
 I mean, it's a waste of meaning. 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:24.310
 It's Italy. It's the last car. Yes. 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:28.000
 So, eventually, the war criminals are going. 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:32.200
 Yes , what do you do? 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.070
 Yes, and after the war ended in Germany in the 20th century, 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.910
 In the 1920s and 20s I heard a lot of dry season industry Weimar Republic 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.600
 It 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:44.740
 But the Great Depression is so low that it's 1929. 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.250
 At that time inflation remembers as a bee wave during the Keno picture at that time. 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.610
 Because 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.780
 It takes over Karo-down agreement on the next screen mark between hated for some 5 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.110
 Yes Yes 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.440
 Having called up the bass is the mother earlier 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.580
 In the end, people want their leaders to be distracted and empowered. 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.020
 Victor emerges as a powerful leader Chassis tenor wakes up with Pasumira 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.920
 Mounts 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.100
 Do not misunderstand one thing here, it's easy for dictatorship to be around 8 o'clock. 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:13.300
 Dictatorship is a politics of the regime . 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.310
 I do not admit my worries, but I can not 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.030
 For fear of being held did go 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:23.750
 But it's not fascism . It's supported by the people . 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:29.030
 Oh, surprisingly, the Germans elected Hitler . 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:31.250
 So far, not even convenience malyijyo are still two people Youtube Adults 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.700
 Fascism . 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.720
 Then his father simyeon wave'll take a blood mark 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.090
 When are you coming? If you break the truth, dictatorship is different. 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.240
 I'm supporting you. 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.360
 So I'm going to put on these new weapons again and challenge again. 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:52.790
 Once again and then finally 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:57.110
 Something that the modern experience that is prevalent in Europe, while inside the establishment 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.610
 There will be no internal war inside Europe at least in the future 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.870
 Value 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.450
 From the seventeenth century to the twentieth century, there was a fierce civil war for about 150 years . 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.870
 In Europe or in the car body 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:13.250
 That's not the end of 1945, 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.480
 You will know that you do not have a European country listening selection. 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:20.810
 It's a person with nitrogen. 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:24.200
 I found a point in the center. Now, this is the German class in the 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.550
 If it was two members of the civil class 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:33.550
 Rice has life on one side 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:36.610
 I intentionally omitted the civil revolution of the Kim In-gyeong class and the sovereignty process of the civil class 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.750
 In this case, this was fascism. 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.750
 Case is social room 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:48.040
 According to the original socialist theory, it has to be done in my advanced capitalist state 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.970
 That's it. 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:55.000
 In the advanced capitalist easier to capitalism in Maro very well live following him 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.950
 Take hold, then we live in makes the board more equitable society in the developed 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.420
 Let's create a society . 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:03.970
 In Russia, Mann did not go through such a stage, 

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:07.570
 It was an imperial capitalist state. 

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:11.770
 Both politically, let's try socialist tendencies for us. 

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:14.100
 Let's skip the civil process, one that came out why 

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.100
 Rush
