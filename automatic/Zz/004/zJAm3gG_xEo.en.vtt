00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.109
 black ops nÃ© 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.109
 but much commented and mayors in the court 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.789
 110 min 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.189
 milk ferry 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.820
 the psychological 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.339
 for the band very secret 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.339
 I'm staying 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.470
 fachetti in order to search within the mind 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.720
 although high the greatest gift that is not proc 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 it's one thing 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.850
 within that framework 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.050
 I was calm in that part that is the mixed, but montero joked from here 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 little 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150
 as well as who is dead in the door 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.470
 Let's try putting it in 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.470
 without the real kind so 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.880
 many claim team leaving will die 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.840
 credit for high death 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.940
 In this house in a little bit 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 then the manufacturer 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 stays a basic blog 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.400
 however the minivans 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
 but I think that the two of us together 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.370
 scott sharp they go from mines 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.850
 has a part of planes 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.340
 in concert decision 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 Then he talked about the fritz museum 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.680
 it was my mother 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.730
 all around the world 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.640
 can be beneficial 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 less than half an hour 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.670
 when I always stay 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 in this position 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 kill lots of friends here 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.220
 during the action 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.339
 and it's even difficult 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:11.969
 it's difficult 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.789
 I did not have any 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.249
 15/4 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.249
 each box 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.029
 and that 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.789
 in this way to fulfill his sentence tadinha 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.789
 the little houses 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.809

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 myrtle cheer 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 We need to score more goals. 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 reflection of this evil 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.859
 my video is inside edemar talking 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:07.739
 this network 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.739
 to close 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.909
 however they say that it serves the sea 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.179
 applying this awareness is good 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.179
 pick up the box 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.729
 It was announced that he had armani proof 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.009
 how cristina 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.009
 symbol of a box 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.509
 if I died, I got it 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.769
 carolina calculated by other 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.769
 Only draw that you can exchange 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 in the attack felipe guerra that did shit 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.849
 not time 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.849
 for now I want to set the agreement time 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.239
 in this field that they 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.639
 supercross and kills very dynamic 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.849
 main field 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 playing hide and seek 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.029
 controversial game he also 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.029
 my expectation 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.400
 Claudia also helping us a lot, huh? 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 helm is too 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:01.620
 inside the court 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.569
 after all it dilates 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.150
 a sentence you have 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.770
 pieces of 65 years he always stays this part of the 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.529
 the dardenne brothers 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.509
 on the ball that was 26/8 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.430
 on the other hand 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.939
