off road and the thing that struck me

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
off road and the thing that struck me
the<00:01:40.799> most<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.609> was<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.030> how<00:01:42.149> quiet<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the most about it was just how quiet it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.170

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.219 
under the hood and even with the windows
down<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.850> could<00:01:48.000> hardly<00:01:48.240> tell<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> was<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> diesel

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
down I could hardly tell it was a diesel
