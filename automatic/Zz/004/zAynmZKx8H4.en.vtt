00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
really not doing anything and in today's

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.810 
really not doing anything and in today's
world<00:03:55.970> that's<00:03:56.600> hard<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.080> do<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.560> leave<00:03:58.550> that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
world that's hard to do and leave that

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.720 
world that's hard to do and leave that
balance<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.800> not<00:04:00.800> task<00:04:01.220> all<00:04:01.580> the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
balance you have to not task all the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.880 
balance you have to not task all the
time<00:04:01.970> we're<00:04:02.360> not<00:04:02.540> we're<00:04:02.780> not<00:04:02.960> wired<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.650> do

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
time we're not we're not wired to do

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.260 
time we're not we're not wired to do
that<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:04.460> this<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.210> an<00:04:05.510> excellent<00:04:05.810> place<00:04:06.110> to

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
that so this is an excellent place to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.960 
that so this is an excellent place to
find<00:04:08.270> that<00:04:08.480> balance
