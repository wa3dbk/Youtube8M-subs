00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
hi everyone this is Peter today I want

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.940 
hi everyone this is Peter today I want
you<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.630> introduce<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.740> light<00:00:10.920> that

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
you to introduce you is the light that

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.270 
you to introduce you is the light that
surrounding<00:00:11.700> me<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.630> loop<00:00:12.870> Lux<00:00:13.170> LED<00:00:14.099> for

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
surrounding me is the loop Lux LED for

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.670 
surrounding me is the loop Lux LED for
now<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.450> front<00:00:15.750> which<00:00:16.020> doing<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> key

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
now so in the front which doing the key

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
now so in the front which doing the key
Enfield<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.220> actually<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> tungsten

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
Enfield is actually the tungsten

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.540 
Enfield is actually the tungsten
versions<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> back<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.130> doing<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
versions and at the back which doing the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
versions and at the back which doing the
kick<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.180> daylight<00:00:21.600> versions<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.619> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
kick is the daylight versions so you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.929 
kick is the daylight versions so you
will<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.430> actually<00:00:23.730> two

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
will see they it's actually two

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.210 
will see they it's actually two
different<00:00:24.359> size<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.930> then<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> small

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
different size and then for the small

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.269 
different size and then for the small
ones<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.090> 650<00:00:27.750> difference<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.680> then

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
ones this is a 650 difference and then

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
ones this is a 650 difference and then
is<00:00:29.810> 45<00:00:30.810> volt<00:00:31.399> power<00:00:32.399> consumptions<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.239> then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is 45 volt power consumptions and then

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.030 
is 45 volt power consumptions and then
the<00:00:34.410> big<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> 1k<00:00:36.350> equivalent<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.559> then

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the big one is a 1k equivalent and then

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.380 
the big one is a 1k equivalent and then
it's<00:00:38.250> 90<00:00:38.670> volt<00:00:38.910> power<00:00:39.660> consumptions<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
it's 90 volt power consumptions so a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's 90 volt power consumptions so a
loop<00:00:42.390> Lux<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.780> actually<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> company<00:00:44.010> which

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
loop Lux is actually a company which

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
loop Lux is actually a company which
doing<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.600> light<00:00:46.410> since<00:00:47.450> 1928<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.440> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
doing a light since 1928 and then this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.439 
doing a light since 1928 and then this
year<00:00:50.489> they<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.789> launched<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> very

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
year they have launched a very

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.639 
year they have launched a very
innovative<00:00:51.809> LED<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
innovative LED for now and so for the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979 
innovative LED for now and so for the
lights<00:00:55.829> itself<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.780> AC

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
lights itself and then you can do the AC

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
lights itself and then you can do the AC
and<00:00:58.379> DC<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> four<00:01:00.149> pin

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and DC and then they have a four pin

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
and DC and then they have a four pin
input<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> back<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:01.949> using

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
input at the back and then you can using

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
input at the back and then you can using
a<00:01:02.430> rebound<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.449> drive<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> power

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a rebound and then just drive the power

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
a rebound and then just drive the power
and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.949> AC<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.670> no<00:01:05.880> problem<00:01:06.330> even

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and then with AC with no problem even

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.080 
and then with AC with no problem even
you<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.049> talking<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.710> 1k<00:01:08.310> versions

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you are talking about that 1k versions

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.410 
you are talking about that 1k versions
too<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.070> actually<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.760> lightly

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
too and if you are actually on lightly

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
too and if you are actually on lightly
beer<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.010> outdoor

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
beer is actually very good for outdoor

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
beer is actually very good for outdoor
because<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> middle<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because if you are like in the middle of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.219 
because if you are like in the middle of
nowhere<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.220> maybe<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.930> middle

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
nowhere or maybe you are in the middle

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
nowhere or maybe you are in the middle
of<00:01:19.259> street<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.830> definitely<00:01:20.280> cannot<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of street you definitely cannot get the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
of street you definitely cannot get the
power<00:01:21.240> AC<00:01:21.509> power<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.350> ya<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
power AC power and then ya put on a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
power AC power and then ya put on a
remount<00:01:23.909> batteries<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.600> just

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
remount batteries and then just

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.969 
remount batteries and then just
switching<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:28.229> if

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
switching on and if you actually like if

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
switching on and if you actually like if
you're<00:01:29.310> using<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.820> indoor<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> studio<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you're using for indoor for a studio I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
you're using for indoor for a studio I
think<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.040> actually<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.610> trend<00:01:32.909> because

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
think this is actually the trend because

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
think this is actually the trend because
nowadays<00:01:33.900> especially<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.979> Hong<00:01:35.159> Kong<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
nowadays especially in Hong Kong and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
nowadays especially in Hong Kong and
then<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.180> electricity<00:01:36.869> fee<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.979> expensive

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
then the electricity fee is so expensive

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.020 
then the electricity fee is so expensive
and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.250> put<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.579> too<00:01:41.820> many

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and then and then if we put on too many

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then and then if we put on too many
like<00:01:42.479> tungsten<00:01:43.229> light<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:44.070> studio

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like tungsten light and then your studio

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
like tungsten light and then your studio
will<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.909> super<00:01:45.450> hot<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
will be super hot and then you have to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.399 
will be super hot and then you have to
put<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.520> aircon<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.840> light

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
put on your aircon and then as light

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.980 
put on your aircon and then as light
maybe<00:01:49.710> Co<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.220> possible<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.360> Drive<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
maybe Co as possible and then is Drive a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.370 
maybe Co as possible and then is Drive a
little<00:01:52.320> electricity<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:53.850> okay

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
little electricity but now okay

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.770 
little electricity but now okay
1k<00:01:55.380> equipment<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.909> actually<00:01:57.149> 90

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
1k equipment this one is actually 90

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.260 
1k equipment this one is actually 90
vote<00:01:57.960> only<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.469> actually<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.219> only<00:01:59.340> 10%<00:01:59.850> from

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
vote only is actually just only 10% from

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.709 
vote only is actually just only 10% from
the<00:02:00.570> lights<00:02:01.250> from<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.280> original<00:02:03.090> tungsten<00:02:03.479> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the lights from the original tungsten so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
the lights from the original tungsten so
you<00:02:03.990> gain<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.189> loss

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you gain a lot of you loss

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
you gain a lot of you loss
you<00:02:06.329> earned<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.930> lot<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> light<00:02:07.530> maybe<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.860> power

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you earned a lot of light maybe a power

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.729 
you earned a lot of light maybe a power
and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.360> no<00:02:09.869> need<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.530> maybe

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and then you no need to just like maybe

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.280 
and then you no need to just like maybe
switch<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.250> your<00:02:11.400> aircon<00:02:11.819> so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
switch on your aircon so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.000 
switch on your aircon so
Co<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.069> then<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.700> make<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:16.010> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Co and then just make the the

Co and then just make the the
environmental<00:02:17.610> friendly<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.240> then<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:19.020> is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
environmental friendly and then this is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.809 
environmental friendly and then this is

looks and and also I like this light
because<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.510> very<00:02:48.810> simple<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.860> they

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
because it's very simple because they

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.949 
because it's very simple because they
don't<00:02:50.610> have<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.940> any<00:02:51.150> light<00:02:51.630> may<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.810> a

don't have like any light may be a

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.500 
don't have like any light may be a
mechanical<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:53.010> maybe<00:02:53.250> motorized<00:02:53.880> system

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
mechanical or maybe motorized system

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.960 
mechanical or maybe motorized system
which<00:02:54.870> make<00:02:55.170> maybe<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.519> maybe<00:02:56.790> so

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
which make maybe it's like maybe so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.509 
which make maybe it's like maybe so
complicated<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:57.750> big<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.560> heavy<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.100> then

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
complicated so big or so heavy and then

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.300 
complicated so big or so heavy and then
you<00:02:59.640> just<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.330> LCD<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> back<00:03:01.950> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
you just have like a LCD and a back and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.970 
you just have like a LCD and a back and
a<00:03:02.430> sigh<00:03:02.640> which<00:03:02.940> aside<00:03:03.510> ER<00:03:03.810> DMX<00:03:04.230> control<00:03:04.709> and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
a sigh which aside ER DMX control and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.120 
a sigh which aside ER DMX control and
also<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.670> society<00:03:06.480> me<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.440> whole<00:03:07.650> design

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
also is society me and the whole design

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.780 
also is society me and the whole design
is<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.370> based<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:10.340> HMI<00:03:11.340> which<00:03:11.580> they

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
is just based on the the HMI which they

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.360 
is just based on the the HMI which they
have<00:03:12.030> already<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:13.140> professional<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.010> use<00:03:14.040> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
have already like professional to use it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.580 
have already like professional to use it
maybe<00:03:14.610> maybe<00:03:15.360> do<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.840> many<00:03:15.989> years<00:03:16.410> and

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
maybe maybe do it for many years and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.789 
maybe maybe do it for many years and
then<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.730> simple<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.630> always<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.110> best<00:03:19.290> it's

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
then so simple is always the best it's

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.150 
then so simple is always the best it's
much<00:03:20.280> easy<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.880> handle<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.299> lighter<00:03:22.049> easy<00:03:22.890> to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
much easy to handle it lighter easy to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.509 
much easy to handle it lighter easy to
fix<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.820> then<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.890> don't<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:25.980> any<00:03:26.130> point<00:03:26.340> why

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
fix and then I don't see any point why

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.880 
fix and then I don't see any point why
why<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.299> make<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.600> make<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.290> le<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
why you have to make it make the le the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.530 
why you have to make it make the le the
lights<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.430> complicated
