00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.270
 well and today we are going to do other 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.309
 cards with lots of love other 4 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.040
 recalls that the previous four 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.509
 You can find the link in the box 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.190
 information just like all 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.750
 you will be able to find it there 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 to be able to do each and every one of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189
 these super cute cards and with 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 a lot of love let's start with the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.180
 first for which you will need your 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 kisses that you can put them with lipstick 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.960
 or with paint if you want extremis' art 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.609
 like me that the truth I did with 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.250
 painting because with life I feel that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.870
 I was going to beat then you put them 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.239
 all in one leaf all that you 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.270
 you want and they start trimming super 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.910
 well then you're going to flip them all and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 let's start making the leaf with him 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.620
 of your preference some banners or 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 pennants that they will hold and they will be 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.539
 like eyelashes to pull these kisses and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.270
 that our beloved person can see them 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.710
 the two to hit the back and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.840
 the next procedure is to make a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.780
 pocket for which nothing else you use 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.650
 your base a rectangle 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.810
 and paste certain banks without without 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.850
 without closing a part so that the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.190
 pocket after finally you mind 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.150
 the kisses and the one of coras to your pleasure 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.310
 and here I put a writing and kisses in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.110
 the part there and I also did a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 fake cooked and well that way we have the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 card is super super easy it was 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.190
 question of a minute that will explain them 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 how to do it and really that is super 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.390
 cute it makes me super personalized and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.090
 I love it here is the freedom 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 of the boyfriend that they can see that what 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.369
 decorate a lot more different and there 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.670
 are the kisses later for the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.610
 next we will occupy a card 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.130
 a decorated sheet or a drawing that you have 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.990
 done had a letter what you want and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.229
 Well, let's start filling it with 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.270
 post-it are us adhesive or can you 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.039
 choose the design you want me 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.979
 I had these little arrows that I do not know 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.720
 they do the most beautiful thing in life but the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.090
 SÃ©nia and I took them for the tutorial 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.150
 I start to clog until you see what 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.729
 less possible and then you're going to start 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.800
 fill those notes with super messages 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.260
 nice that well who we like that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.050
 fill us with beautiful things right 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.000
 so if there are as you can see already 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.620
 I'm finishing putting the messages and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.510
 it's that easy to make this card that 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.520
 they really liked it in the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.920
 notepad to me it was not done to me because the great 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.200
 thing but I wanted to teach them because if 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.030
 they were asking me enough the tutorial 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.950
 or how he had done it and then 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.320
 unclog it and then discover the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.870
 message in the tutorial I made a sheet 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.060
 decorated and in the notebook and stamp the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.959
 drawing then of us for the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.280
 next let's take our envelope and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.670
 open it and stick it in the back 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.250
 in our base sheet you have to take care 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.040
 make it at the bottom so that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.350
 let's have space for our hearts 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.090
 now you are going to take them in the hearts 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.850
 that you could have cut out of magazines 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.620
 made yourself drawn what you want 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.170
 and we are going to start to accommodate them as 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.230
 more we like after obviously the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.520
 we have to paste to make it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.430
 literally an exploration of love and 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.460
 of hearts that for me is super pretty 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.320
 and super cute finally I put piece and 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.300
 he saw that wife is love you and a fake 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.580
 sewn to the envelope that the truth for me 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.100
 They give super nice touches and that's what we have left 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.530
 the super pretty bang card 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.970
 of love and hearts and as I say 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.040
 The freedom of the groom is a 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.690
 little bit more detailed are different 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.940
 colors and they are many more 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.010
 little hearts and magazines that come 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.040
 more detailed and then finally 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.580
 for the last card I will use this 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.230
 small piece of black paper to make it look like 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.360
 that my base is completely black 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.620
 although they are short opaline and then 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.660
 let's make an envelope with paper 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 decorator that you choose or a sheet of 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.910
 color what you want after we go to 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.280
 take our vinyl record site that 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.580
 you can find it in bazaars or today 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.250
 just print it draw it if I 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.690
 I had this is that my mom brought me but 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.910
 but if you can find it out there 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.900
 print it and decorate it at your leisure and 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.510
 here I put a paper 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.890
 purple and then I wrote it over for 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.829
 that it was not seen only the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.660
 district that if there were a little bit more 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.340
 personalized the matter I put you I love you and 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.750
 Happy masters, you understand, we're going to 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.180
 put in our pocket that we did 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.370
 previously and here and then nothing else 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.740
 is decorating at your whim I put two 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.139
 cards that say songs for you that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.970
 because they are the songs for you and in the 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.520
 another one, the little songs that 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.220
 I wanted to dedicate to that I put some pieces 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.050
 of tape and it's more super nice because 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.380
 you can dedicate songs and others is 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.050
 a super cute detail which is very 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.120
 retro fashion now and we have left 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.740
 the card and I loved this idea when 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.860
 it occurred to me I did not think that to stay 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.630
 so nice but I said I liked it 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.430
 more and you 're done for the tutorial that 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.710
 the other because the one in the notebook is like 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.199
 very dull now and super cute 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.990
 but rather because you liked 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.050
 obviously there are more songs and if 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.300
 Well, these were the ideas that I have 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.410
 for this valentine for you I hope 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.990
 what did you like 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.539
 remember again that I have the first 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.889
 part in the information box I'll 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.139
 I wish you have a lot 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.449
 always every day of life that you 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.949

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.159
