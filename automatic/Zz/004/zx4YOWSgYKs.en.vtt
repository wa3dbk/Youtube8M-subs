00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.829
 the last report labor 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.679
 and the board and the public in general 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.389
 is 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.389
 puerto rico marcos ayala and familiar 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.759
 claim 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.169
 the republic we can grow 3 stand up to save a minute of 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.169
 silence 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.049
 the durango team 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.059
 jump planted the field very well 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.329
 he came to get his point 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.199
 if he takes it we ask we are working well 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.609
 you destroyed some clear goal opportunities 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.629
 we did not know how to concretize now I will warn verse of what is it in the 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.439
 previous match no 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.789
 this is just all starting because we have to work a lot 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.779
 a draw at home is not good 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.169
 here the three points have to be left the opposing team has to 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.979
 be very very superior 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.069
 we 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.319
 nor is that how it is to get a job 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.519
 I am tiger 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.909
 chivas 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.900
 good before anything cnh have seen a great game with the two teams 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.029
 trying to 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:22.119
 efe achieve the goal that is the goal 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:26.629
 certainly in a closed match in which the tumults and work as 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.669
 Durango's team always try to do it by doing it 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.719
 is actually the reality is that the people this this 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.959
 or it's just a baseball game 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.409
 but in reality one battle was lost but not the war 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.010
 so to come and support the people with more enthusiasm here actually gives me 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.379
 I still like mine and that the older people come and that 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.239
 know how to support the team we need a bit of culture in that aspect proved 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.419
 keep fighting for that because we are fighters although very well very well 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.959
 fifteen minutes after the hotel videos 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.939
 this is a single for all those who watch other videos hear forced to all 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:06.520
 children 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.780
 what yes and that this the fighters the reality was that I can
