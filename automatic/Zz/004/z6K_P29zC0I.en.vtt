00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
two one so we came up with a concept

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.630 
two one so we came up with a concept
where<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.780> only<00:00:45.960> needs<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.829> one

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
where there really only needs to be one

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.959 
where there really only needs to be one
internet<00:00:48.539> mall<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:49.800> fifteen<00:00:50.280> percent<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
internet mall over fifteen percent of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.930 
internet mall over fifteen percent of
all<00:00:51.230> commerce<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.920> done<00:00:53.250> via<00:00:53.730> the

all commerce is now done via the
internet<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:55.140> equates<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.920> excess<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
internet that equates to in excess of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
internet that equates to in excess of
three<00:00:57.590> billion<00:00:58.590> dollars<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.789> day<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.989> our

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
three billion dollars a day and so our

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.650 
three billion dollars a day and so our
goal<00:01:01.469> through<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.250> internet<00:01:02.699> mall<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.329> to
