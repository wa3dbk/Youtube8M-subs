but literally just that much just a tiny

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.630 
but literally just that much just a tiny
little<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.500> now<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> same<00:01:58.950> time<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
little bit now at the same time you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.580 
little bit now at the same time you
always<00:01:59.880> want<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.390> keep<00:02:00.539> that<00:02:00.720> pasta<00:02:01.200> moving

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
always want to keep that pasta moving

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.920 
always want to keep that pasta moving
very<00:02:01.830> very<00:02:02.190> important<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> always<00:02:03.509> moves

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
very very important that it always moves

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
very very important that it always moves
around<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:05.220> we're<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.850> wait<00:02:06.000> for

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
around so we're just going to wait for

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
around so we're just going to wait for
that<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.330> come<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> boil<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.260> thicken

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that to come to the boil and thicken

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.590 
that to come to the boil and thicken
slightly<00:02:07.860> before<00:02:08.519> we<00:02:08.820> start<00:02:09.149> adding<00:02:09.269> all

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
slightly before we start adding all

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.420 
slightly before we start adding all

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
really see that that cream after about

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.870 
really see that that cream after about
two<00:02:13.500> minutes<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:14.070> starting<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.489> come<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
two minutes is starting to come to the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.699 
two minutes is starting to come to the
boil<00:02:15.030> now<00:02:15.269> that's<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.870> perfect<00:02:16.110> time<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
boil now that's the perfect time to

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.270 
boil now that's the perfect time to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
need to just keep it moving around

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
need to just keep it moving around
because<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.470> want<00:02:22.650> those<00:02:22.830> cheeses<00:02:23.340> to

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
because you don't want those cheeses to

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.120 
because you don't want those cheeses to
stick<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.660> bottom<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.380> goes<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.920> nice

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130

sharp<00:02:26.489> cheddar<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.470> what<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> cheese's<00:02:29.190> do

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
sharp cheddar and what the cheese's do

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.210 
sharp cheddar and what the cheese's do
is<00:02:29.610> they<00:02:30.120> act<00:02:30.299> as<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> fantastic<00:02:31.220> thickening

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.190 
is they act as a fantastic thickening
agent<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.850> when<00:02:33.360> they<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:33.870> into<00:02:34.019> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
off the heat because there's actually

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.580

to melt those cheez-its the last thing
we<00:02:57.659> want<00:02:57.689> is<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.109> cheese<00:02:58.590> sticking<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.099> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that really gives the macaroni a very

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.589 
that really gives the macaroni a very
distinct<00:03:11.159> flavor<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.700> that's<00:03:12.030> some<00:03:12.239> fresh

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
distinct flavor and that's some fresh

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.330 
distinct flavor and that's some fresh
nutmeg<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:14.159> in<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.639> goes<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:17.159> bring

nine minutes so I think that's perfectly
ready<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.760> strain<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.660> over<00:03:35.320> here<00:03:35.500> we<00:03:35.770> have<00:03:35.890> our

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
ready to strain so over here we have our

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.050 
ready to strain so over here we have our
strainer<00:03:36.400> ready<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.260> goes<00:03:38.470> be<00:03:39.220> very<00:03:39.640> very

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
strainer ready and it goes be very very

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.900 
strainer ready and it goes be very very
careful<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:41.890> don't<00:03:42.070> burn<00:03:42.340> yourself<00:03:42.520> at

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
careful that you don't burn yourself at

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.560 
careful that you don't burn yourself at
this<00:03:43.030> stage<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:44.260> once<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.560> straight<00:03:45.070> enough

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
this stage so once that straight enough

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:52.140
