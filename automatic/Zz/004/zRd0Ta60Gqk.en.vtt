00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.030

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.469
 retired and expresses his worldview 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.679
 carving your talent in wood 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.289
 in his atelier assembled outdoors 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.900
 your body creates rustic and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.380
 objects of decoration in full contact 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.109

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.230
 green interior of ibotirama sir 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.599
 jesus boy does what he likes the most 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.790
 Since childhood I had the will I had 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.790
 willingness to work as an artist 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.930
 in the beginning was guided by intuition giving 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.700
 form trunks and pieces of wood that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.500
 found in nature 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.200
 with the passage of time he felt the need 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.450
 to improve the technique and went to 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.730
 where he learned more 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.340
 sophisticated wooden notch 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.860
 after living for more than 20 years in the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.410
 the big city decided to go back to the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.600
 small place I came back because it gave 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.880
 I miss my beloved people's land 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 from the northeast so I came back to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.460
 to reverse my relatives who were 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 long time since I had not seen 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 in the midst of nature the imagination wins 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 lonely work that requires 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.180
 a lot of sensitivity 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 by the skilled hands of Lord Resino 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 the rustic and the delicacy meet 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.490
 expressing the strength of the culture of a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.490
 people 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.649
 each wood chip removed from the block 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.359
 revealing what previously existed in the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.399
 artist thinking 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.890
 dedication to creating the details is 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.359
 so much that he seems to plunge into a 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.030
 another dimension 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.789
 It's a therapy for me and it makes me very well. 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.780
 for mental health and also for the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.240
 spirit 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.479
 the time to complete each piece varies 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.609
 much your example can take only one 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.489
 day to complete a notch as was the 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.709
 case dsk lang pt which is a mixture of 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.019
 calango with pt but can take more 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.180
 time is the case of this cross that he is 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.190
 holding and took a month to complete 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.709
 this work, your example that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.930
 time and took a lot of time to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.440
 do this job because the team 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.090
 has developed a tool for me to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.040
 give me this opportunity to do this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.400
 kind of work here that has the name of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.170
 lion and they would become so I had 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 involve another technique to make 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.140
 this work here detail that would be the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.989
 my trademark that is half 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.989
 difficult for another artist to 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.359
 kind of make the tools used in the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.180
 notches are called goiÃ¡s 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.669
 each blade produces a different effect and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.569
 are applied to carve from pieces 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:01.250
 more abstract to figurative works 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.280
 Mr. Resino says perfection does not 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.090
 exists but always seeks to improve 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.709
 the key is the effort and humility have 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.230
 that work every day working with 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.230
 courage and the will to work and much 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 creativity and thus develop this 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 Labor thank God
