so here I am she is someone knowledge
legal<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:49.170> how<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.410> things

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.219 

the<00:02:07.860> rugby<00:02:08.100> site<00:02:08.400> when<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> first<00:02:09.660> heard<00:02:09.900> of<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the rugby site when I first heard of it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.680 
the rugby site when I first heard of it
in<00:02:10.470> first<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.130> will<00:02:11.250> look<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:12.300> something

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
in first I will look at it was something

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
in first I will look at it was something
that<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:12.930> thought<00:02:13.230> was<00:02:13.380> fascinating

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that I just thought was fascinating

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
that I just thought was fascinating
obviously<00:02:14.520> for<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> number<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.810> reasons

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
obviously for a number of reasons

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800 
obviously for a number of reasons
largely<00:02:16.730> from<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> people<00:02:18.180> involved<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.780> mean

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
largely from the people involved I mean

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.240 
largely from the people involved I mean
people<00:02:19.320> are<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.620> over<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.920> top<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
people are right over the top of the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.650 
people are right over the top of the
world<00:02:20.540> return<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.840> coaching<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.530> Planck

initiated the site that's always
interest<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.630> it's<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> way<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.730> it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
interest and it's just the way that it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.960 
interest and it's just the way that it
approaches<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> game<00:02:30.660> because<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.700> could

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
approaches the game because it could

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760 
approaches the game because it could
well<00:02:33.000> be<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.140> three<00:02:34.500> or<00:02:34.560> four

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
well be that you have three or four

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.350 
well be that you have three or four
coaches<00:02:35.040> from<00:02:35.490> different<00:02:35.880> parts<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
coaches from different parts in the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.480 
coaches from different parts in the
world<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:37.110> addressing<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.710> same<00:02:38.010> topic

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
world actually addressing the same topic

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.340 
world actually addressing the same topic
but<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.090> complete<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.540> different<00:02:39.810> ways<00:02:39.960> I

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
but it complete in different ways I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.680 
but it complete in different ways I
think<00:02:40.860> for<00:02:41.130> people<00:02:41.280> looking<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.270> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
think for people looking in on that and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.510 
think for people looking in on that and
that<00:02:42.930> will<00:02:43.020> requite<00:02:43.380> fascinating<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.310> see

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
that will requite fascinating to see

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.850 
that will requite fascinating to see
that<00:02:44.760> actually<00:02:45.210> even<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.110> top<00:02:46.320> cultures<00:02:46.770> in

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
that actually even the top cultures in

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.860 
that actually even the top cultures in
the<00:02:46.950> world<00:02:46.980> don't<00:02:47.550> always<00:02:47.820> approach<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.660> same

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the world don't always approach the same

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.290 
the world don't always approach the same
subject<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> same<00:02:49.740> way<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.760> actually<00:02:50.910> get

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
subject in the same way but actually get

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.860 
subject in the same way but actually get

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.199 
learn or to teach the scrum I never I
never<00:03:10.830> think<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.400> people<00:03:11.670> want<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.940> listen

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.280 

as<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.070> coach<00:03:55.400> having<00:03:56.000> coached<00:03:56.300> NPC<00:03:57.050> in<00:03:57.170> New

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
as a coach having coached NPC in New

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.430 
as a coach having coached NPC in New
Zealand<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.860> super<00:03:58.700> super<00:03:59.300> 14<00:03:59.750> as<00:03:59.930> it<00:04:00.050> was<00:04:00.170> in

in<00:04:00.680> New<00:04:00.860> Zealand<00:04:00.890> going<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.820> Clermont<00:04:02.690> and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
in New Zealand going to Clermont and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.480 
in New Zealand going to Clermont and
being<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.500> France<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:04.040> then<00:04:04.100> going<00:04:04.460> to

being in France and then going to
Ireland<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.090> think<00:04:05.960> it<00:04:06.050> definitely<00:04:06.980> gives<00:04:07.250> you

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.160 
Ireland I think it definitely gives you
a<00:04:07.460> whole<00:04:07.970> lot<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.180> flavors<00:04:08.600> that<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:08.960> meld

a whole lot of flavors that you can meld

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.020 
a whole lot of flavors that you can meld
together<00:04:09.380> into<00:04:09.950> it's<00:04:10.400> your<00:04:10.580> own<00:04:10.700> particular

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
together into it's your own particular

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.360 
together into it's your own particular
pot<00:04:11.480> for<00:04:11.990> me<00:04:12.110> getting<00:04:12.320> involved<00:04:12.710> in<00:04:12.830> rugby

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
pot for me getting involved in rugby

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.520 
pot for me getting involved in rugby
saath<00:04:13.610> kaam<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.240> just<00:04:14.810> an<00:04:14.930> opportunity<00:04:15.080> to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
saath kaam is just an opportunity to

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.699 
saath kaam is just an opportunity to
share<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.190> bit<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.430> experience<00:04:16.880> really<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:17.900> think
