00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.590
 a role you have to live it and you have to 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.660

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.620
 can I talk so far about calling 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.890

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.630
 I'm getting into the company 's 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.260
 client in the client's office and in 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.360
 the mind as very easy step 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.730
 gradually to prevent that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.220
 potential client feels invaded and 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.920
 What I'm looking for is making him feel comfortable and 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.480
 achieve a dialogue that usually only 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.750
 you have to give the telephone operators the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.150
 people call you turn on a cassette speech 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.900
 instead of listening to the sale that 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.420
 listen I call with listening and for 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.750
 put myself at the disposal of the other and good 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.730
 this is a very important issue that there 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.160
 to keep in mind because generally 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.310
 it produces a lot of frustration the people who 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.989
 It communicates by phone calls ago 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.989
 many calls for days usually 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.519
 If we are wrong path or not 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.400

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.120

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.930
 convenient but it is very important that 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.210

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.370
