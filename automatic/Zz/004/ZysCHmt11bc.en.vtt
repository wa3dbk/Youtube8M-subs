00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
the three prongs at the end just gives

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.540 
the three prongs at the end just gives
you<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.780> lot<00:00:57.500> of<00:00:57.560> confidence<00:00:58.010> because<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.399> feels

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
you a lot of confidence because it feels

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.830 
you a lot of confidence because it feels
like<00:00:58.760> if<00:00:59.329> you<00:01:00.200> just<00:01:00.320> have<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.560> person<00:01:01.190> in<00:01:01.840> in

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
those in the mail gaps of those prongs

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.160 
those in the mail gaps of those prongs
it<00:01:05.180> feels<00:01:05.360> like<00:01:05.479> you're<00:01:05.600> just<00:01:05.750> going<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.020> get

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
and I get a nice little wall shot there

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.760 
and I get a nice little wall shot there
but<00:01:40.579> thus<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.479> statistics<00:01:42.320> for<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.619> xm8<00:01:44.770> with

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
but thus the statistics for the xm8 with

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.880 
but thus the statistics for the xm8 with
normal<00:01:46.100> ammo<00:01:46.340> at<00:01:46.549> close<00:01:46.789> range<00:01:47.259> 20.8<00:01:48.259> fire

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
normal ammo at close range 20.8 fire

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.999 
normal ammo at close range 20.8 fire
range<00:01:49.630> 17.99<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.170> goes<00:01:51.350> down<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.649> little<00:01:51.859> bit

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
range 17.99 so it goes down a little bit

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.639 
range 17.99 so it goes down a little bit
in<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.310> effectiveness<00:01:52.789> at<00:01:53.119> long<00:01:53.600> range<00:01:53.899> but

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
in the effectiveness at long range but

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.050 
in the effectiveness at long range but
it's<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.920> pretty<00:01:55.069> average<00:01:55.310> con<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:55.850> it's<00:01:55.969> not

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
it's a pretty average con so it's not

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.160 
it's a pretty average con so it's not
bad<00:01:56.409> close<00:01:57.409> range<00:01:57.770> really<00:01:58.459> good<00:01:58.610> effect<00:01:58.909> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
bad close range really good effect of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.569 
bad close range really good effect of
effectiveness<00:02:00.880> 26.1<00:02:01.880> with<00:02:02.689> Magnum<00:02:03.110> ammo<00:02:03.380> and

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
effectiveness 26.1 with Magnum ammo and

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.880 
effectiveness 26.1 with Magnum ammo and
22.4<00:02:04.579> at<00:02:04.759> fire<00:02:05.000> range<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.539> which<00:02:06.289> armor<00:02:06.709> goes

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
22.4 at fire range and which armor goes

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.719 
22.4 at fire range and which armor goes
out<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> lot<00:02:07.599> 15.7<00:02:08.599> close<00:02:08.959> range<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.729> 13.4

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
out a lot 15.7 close range and 13.4

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.770

percent<00:02:11.090> damage<00:02:11.269> at<00:02:11.630> fire<00:02:12.110> range<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:13.780> that's

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
percent damage at fire range and that's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.330 
percent damage at fire range and that's
that's<00:02:14.959> pretty<00:02:15.140> good<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.190> I

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
that's pretty good this is this is I

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.509 
that's pretty good this is this is I
must<00:02:16.670> say<00:02:16.849> one<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.120> my<00:02:17.269> favorite<00:02:17.720> assault<00:02:18.110> guns

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
must say one of my favorite assault guns

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.420 
must say one of my favorite assault guns
so<00:02:19.519> normal<00:02:20.299> range<00:02:20.569> close<00:02:21.230> shots<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.829> kill<00:02:22.010> five

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
so normal range close shots to kill five

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.819 
so normal range close shots to kill five
at<00:02:22.760> fire<00:02:23.030> range<00:02:23.299> which<00:02:23.450> normal<00:02:23.780> m.o<00:02:24.019> six<00:02:24.440> shots

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
at fire range which normal m.o six shots

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.819 
at fire range which normal m.o six shots
to<00:02:25.069> kill<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:26.269> Magnum<00:02:26.690> mo<00:02:26.870> only<00:02:27.290> takes<00:02:27.470> four

to kill with Magnum mo only takes four

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.400 
to kill with Magnum mo only takes four
shots<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.459> kill<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.630> armor<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.170> takes

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
shots to kill and with armor it takes

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.940 
shots to kill and with armor it takes
seven<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.950> eight<00:02:31.160> shots<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.970> kill<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.390> person

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
seven to eight shots to kill the person

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.309 
seven to eight shots to kill the person
the<00:02:33.950> rate<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.130> fire<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.640> pretty<00:02:35.180> average<00:02:36.730> 750

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
the rate of fire is pretty average 750

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.940 
the rate of fire is pretty average 750
per<00:02:39.319> minute<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.510> time<00:02:41.510> between<00:02:41.690> shots<00:02:43.690> 0.08

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
per minute and time between shots 0.08

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.530 
per minute and time between shots 0.08
so<00:02:45.950> that's<00:02:46.459> not<00:02:46.579> bad<00:02:46.790> that's<00:02:47.150> pretty<00:02:47.359> average

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
so that's not bad that's pretty average

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.400 
so that's not bad that's pretty average
you<00:02:47.930> know<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:48.560> gone<00:02:48.799> FSA<00:02:49.459> oil<00:02:50.030> average<00:02:50.420> time

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
you know it's gone FSA oil average time

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.690 
you know it's gone FSA oil average time
the<00:02:51.590> kill<00:02:51.799> with<00:02:52.790> normal<00:02:53.120> MO<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.560> 0.32<00:02:54.700> seconds

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the kill with normal MO is 0.32 seconds

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.000 
the kill with normal MO is 0.32 seconds
and<00:02:55.880> was<00:02:56.420> Magnum<00:02:56.959> ammo<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.730> very<00:02:58.730> short<00:02:59.120> time<00:02:59.209> of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and was Magnum ammo a very short time of

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.099 
and was Magnum ammo a very short time of
0.2<00:03:01.010> four<00:03:01.400> seconds<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.299> is<00:03:02.510> actually

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
0.2 four seconds and that is actually

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.819 
0.2 four seconds and that is actually
the<00:03:03.319> fastest<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.250> all<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.299> assault<00:03:05.630> kits<00:03:05.930> so

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
the fastest of all the assault kits so

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.830 
the fastest of all the assault kits so

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
close like combat close combat in

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.180 
close like combat close combat in
buildings<00:03:12.700> definitely<00:03:13.700> goes<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.030> xm8<00:03:15.190> best

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
buildings definitely goes the xm8 best

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.240 
buildings definitely goes the xm8 best
gun<00:03:16.639> for<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.769> it's<00:03:18.769> pretty<00:03:18.950> good<00:03:19.069> gun

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
gun for that and it's pretty good gun

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.589 
gun for that and it's pretty good gun
for<00:03:19.430> long<00:03:19.549> range<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.120> just<00:03:20.269> gotta<00:03:20.450> learn

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
for long range to you just gotta learn

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.979 
for long range to you just gotta learn
how<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.900> tap<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:23.150> reload<00:03:23.540> time<00:03:23.569> for

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
how to tap it and the reload time for

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.670 
how to tap it and the reload time for
the<00:03:24.049> xm8<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.769> actually<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.310> shortest<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.680> 2.1

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
the xm8 is actually the shortest to 2.1

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.479 
the xm8 is actually the shortest to 2.1
to<00:03:28.130> 2.8<00:03:29.120> seconds<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.769> actually<00:03:31.160> really

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
to 2.8 seconds that is actually really

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.750 
to 2.8 seconds that is actually really
short<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.889> it's<00:03:33.889> pretty<00:03:34.130> good<00:03:34.340> because<00:03:34.669> you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
short and it's pretty good because you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.420 
short and it's pretty good because you
don't<00:03:34.940> have<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.239> do<00:03:35.419> any<00:03:35.709> bolt<00:03:36.709> action<00:03:37.250> or

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
don't have to do any bolt action or

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.400 
don't have to do any bolt action or
anything<00:03:37.730> like<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.209> just<00:03:38.239> pop<00:03:38.690> pop<00:03:39.169> the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
anything like that you just pop pop the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.620 
anything like that you just pop pop the
ammo<00:03:39.590> okay<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.700> pop<00:03:40.819> it<00:03:40.970> back<00:03:41.000> in<00:03:41.299> it's<00:03:41.450> all

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
ammo okay so and pop it back in it's all

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.420 
ammo okay so and pop it back in it's all
good<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.870> go<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:43.480> hip<00:03:44.480> spread<00:03:44.989> 1.5<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.250> while

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
good to go so hip spread 1.5 and while

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.820 
good to go so hip spread 1.5 and while
you're<00:03:46.459> moving<00:03:46.959> 2.5

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
you're moving 2.5

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.880 
you're moving 2.5
just<00:03:49.460> like<00:03:50.000> all<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.330> other<00:03:50.780> guns<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.410> the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
just like all the other guns and the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.120 
just like all the other guns and the
recoil<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.660> 0.37<00:03:53.660> seconds<00:03:54.470> that's<00:03:54.950> pretty

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
recoil is 0.37 seconds that's pretty

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.530 
recoil is 0.37 seconds that's pretty
good<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.890> all<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.280> statistics<00:03:58.540> for

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
good so that is all the statistics for

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.490 
good so that is all the statistics for
the<00:03:59.600> XM<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.620> prototype<00:04:01.300> either<00:04:02.300> in<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.810> very

conquest<00:04:45.860> mode<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:49.330> yeah<00:04:50.330> overall<00:04:50.810> xm8<00:04:51.440> very

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
conquest mode so yeah overall xm8 very

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.050 
conquest mode so yeah overall xm8 very
good<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.810> looks<00:04:54.200> like<00:04:54.320> you<00:04:54.650> can't<00:04:54.980> put<00:04:55.550> the

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
good and it looks like you can't put the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.060 
good and it looks like you can't put the
dot<00:04:56.300> scope<00:04:56.660> or<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:57.110> four<00:04:57.320> times<00:04:57.560> acog<00:04:58.040> scope

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
dot scope or the four times acog scope

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.730 
dot scope or the four times acog scope
on<00:04:58.550> here<00:04:59.000> because<00:04:59.450> it<00:04:59.780> just<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.230> just<00:05:00.290> it's

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
on here because it just it just it's

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.870 
on here because it just it just it's
just<00:05:00.800> nice<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.070> fine<00:05:01.400> on<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.580> time<00:05:01.760> it

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
just nice and fine on the time it

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.790 
just nice and fine on the time it
doesn't<00:05:01.940> look<00:05:02.180> like<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.450> put<00:05:02.600> online<00:05:02.720> but<00:05:03.620> you

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
doesn't look like you put online but you

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.740 
doesn't look like you put online but you
can<00:05:04.070> put<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.490> dot<00:05:04.669> scope<00:05:04.970> or<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.330> four<00:05:05.510> times

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
can put the dot scope or the four times

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.080 
can put the dot scope or the four times
ACOG<00:05:06.110> scope<00:05:06.140> on<00:05:06.650> like<00:05:07.370> any<00:05:07.669> other<00:05:08.060> gun<00:05:09.100> so<00:05:10.100> this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
ACOG scope on like any other gun so this

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.230 
ACOG scope on like any other gun so this
gun<00:05:11.380> very<00:05:12.380> good<00:05:12.700> I'd<00:05:13.700> have<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.270> say<00:05:16.000> use<00:05:17.000> this

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
gun very good I'd have to say use this

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.180 
gun very good I'd have to say use this
gun<00:05:17.770> if<00:05:18.770> you<00:05:19.580> want<00:05:19.820> to<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.650> pretty<00:05:22.070> decent

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
gun if you want to get a pretty decent

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.240 
gun if you want to get a pretty decent
average<00:05:22.880> score<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.680> I'm<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:24.860> testing<00:05:25.040> with

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
average score and I'm just testing with

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.790 
average score and I'm just testing with
a<00:05:25.340> long-range<00:05:25.760> effectiveness<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.840> wasn't

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
a long-range effectiveness I wasn't

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.170 
a long-range effectiveness I wasn't
aiming<00:05:28.010> very<00:05:28.310> good<00:05:28.430> cuz<00:05:28.550> he<00:05:28.610> was<00:05:28.669> running<00:05:29.000> but

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
aiming very good cuz he was running but

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300 
aiming very good cuz he was running but
the<00:05:29.900> long-range<00:05:30.320> in<00:05:30.410> this<00:05:30.560> gun<00:05:30.710> is<00:05:30.740> pretty

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
the long-range in this gun is pretty

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.740 
the long-range in this gun is pretty
decent<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:32.060> was<00:05:32.300> pretty<00:05:32.840> far<00:05:33.229> away<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:34.750> it

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
decent that was pretty far away and it

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.420 
decent that was pretty far away and it
doesn't<00:05:36.110> really<00:05:36.169> make<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:36.470> there<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.860> kind<00:05:37.400> of

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
doesn't really make it there it kind of

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.140 
doesn't really make it there it kind of
spreads<00:05:37.640> it<00:05:37.850> at<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.030> end<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.669> just<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.120> just

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
spreads it at the end and I just I just

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.760 
spreads it at the end and I just I just
run<00:05:41.479> up<00:05:41.600> in<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:41.840> little<00:05:42.020> crater<00:05:42.350> and<00:05:42.500> he<00:05:42.590> runs

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
run up in this little crater and he runs

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.020 
run up in this little crater and he runs
by<00:05:43.010> and<00:05:43.160> I<00:05:43.220> get<00:05:43.460> them<00:05:43.580> but<00:05:44.590> yeah<00:05:45.590> XM<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.190> good<00:05:46.820> gun

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
by and I get them but yeah XM a good gun

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.740 
by and I get them but yeah XM a good gun
and<00:05:47.300> I<00:05:48.200> also<00:05:48.740> like<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:48.950> style<00:05:49.340> it<00:05:50.270> doesn't

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
and I also like the style it doesn't

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.500 
and I also like the style it doesn't
take<00:05:50.900> up<00:05:51.110> very<00:05:51.770> much<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.250> screen<00:05:52.729> when<00:05:53.419> you

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
take up very much the screen when you

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.380 
take up very much the screen when you
have<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:53.720> down<00:05:53.990> low<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:55.580> have<00:05:55.760> pretty<00:05:56.060> much<00:05:56.120> all

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
have a down low you have pretty much all

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.529 
have a down low you have pretty much all
your<00:05:56.570> focus<00:05:57.250> straight<00:05:58.250> ahead<00:05:58.340> you<00:05:59.210> know<00:05:59.330> get

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
your focus straight ahead you know get

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:00.940 
your focus straight ahead you know get
that<00:05:59.660> in<00:05:59.780> your<00:05:59.810> face

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
that in your face

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.340 
that in your face
like<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.280> f2000<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.330> thing<00:06:02.630> is<00:06:02.840> just<00:06:03.050> way

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
like the f2000 that thing is just way

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.610 
like the f2000 that thing is just way
too<00:06:03.410> chunky<00:06:03.890> for<00:06:04.220> me<00:06:04.370> and<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.990> mobility<00:06:06.590> of

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
too chunky for me and the mobility of

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.890 
too chunky for me and the mobility of
this<00:06:06.890> gun<00:06:07.100> is<00:06:07.130> pretty<00:06:07.490> good<00:06:07.760> and<00:06:08.000> by<00:06:08.270> mobility

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
this gun is pretty good and by mobility

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.160 
this gun is pretty good and by mobility
I<00:06:08.930> mean<00:06:10.030> it<00:06:11.030> just<00:06:11.180> feels<00:06:11.420> light<00:06:11.720> in<00:06:11.810> your<00:06:11.870> hand

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
I mean it just feels light in your hand

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.620 
I mean it just feels light in your hand
and<00:06:12.410> it<00:06:13.340> doesn't<00:06:13.640> feel<00:06:13.700> like<00:06:13.790> your<00:06:14.030> candy<00:06:14.330> was

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
and it doesn't feel like your candy was

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.570 
and it doesn't feel like your candy was
really<00:06:14.810> heavy<00:06:14.960> machine<00:06:15.410> guns<00:06:15.650> it's<00:06:15.950> it's<00:06:16.250> just

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
really heavy machine guns it's it's just

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.450 
really heavy machine guns it's it's just
a<00:06:16.700> very<00:06:17.030> nice<00:06:17.320> average<00:06:18.320> gun<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.980> start<00:06:19.250> off

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
a very nice average gun to start off
