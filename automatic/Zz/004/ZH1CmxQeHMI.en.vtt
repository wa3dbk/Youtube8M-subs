00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.390
 hi girls so me it's her and 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.799
 me it's coraline so we'll you 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.410
 present a little all our products for 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.460
 the hair and we will start with the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.640
 champions then I'm using the little 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.279
 Marseille honey shea butter is for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.920
 dry and damaged hair 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.140
 I do not necessarily have dry hair but 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.150
 I like them because he makes me 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.840
 gifted and shiny hair 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.860
 that's after I use the after 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.810
 shampoo in the same range and I love him 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 good because I have a lot of volume 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.390
 still and big loops so 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.340
 Sam weighs a little hair and that's it 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.570
 so I have three shampoo because 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.760
 I alternate to not that my hair 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.040
 gets too used to a shampoo knowing 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 that I have super fine hair and who 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.120
 gets involved very easily so in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.010
 first I have the very soft dock shampoo 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.650
 with vegetable milk 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.640
 so it's a little basic shampoo 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.739
 committed to when we wash 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 hair every day me I used it 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.310
 especially in summer when I went to the beach 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.400
 like that it does not interest the hair in 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.880
 plus it must cost less than 2 euros 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 in all large areas 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.050
 then I have a second field point 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 their melons that I have since not really 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:28.110
 long name this bot and quam so 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.340
 it's a shampoo but my lamps and I 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.780
 find that it works pretty well you 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.550
 like the hair with it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 remember finally frozen since not too much 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.450
 a long time so I can not see too much 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.460
 effects 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.119
 listening fifteen euros and it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.549
 revenge among hairdressers 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.360
 then I have the flowers of the male of that 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.630
 auch it costs ten euros and he 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.950
 has a violet scent a little they 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.750
 are very strong when we put on the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.920
 hair but after actually there is the smell 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.509
 that remain in the hair and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.060
 moving boundaries we feel the gas is 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.450
 super nice and he's supposed to do some 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.909
 red blond glare it is meant 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.280
 normally with white and gray hair 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.289
 but the saleswoman told me that it disturbs 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.090
 not if I had brown hair so 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.430
 I'm using a mask 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.730
 once in two always the small 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.599
 Marseille honey shea butter and it is 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.989
 on sale in all major 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.209
 surfaces and I do not know the price anymore but 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.040
 it is not very expensive and I like them 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.060
 because it makes super soft hair 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.420
 and light I find it super nice and 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.519
 they are three years old this is then 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.010
 go when I finish washing them 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.739
 hair I support that his cell quan on 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.720
 lengths and spikes 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.230
 it turns out that years at the hairdressers 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 and customs dozens of euros actually 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.010
 it's a balm that has several effects 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.340
 repairs the hair turn on the forks 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.310
 it helps to control the friezes aa the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.040
 structures and saha protects the leather 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.500
 haired 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.770
 it protects 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.600
 uv it's dry for the blow-dry that's them 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.450
 makes you talented and can also be used 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.990
 for the bodies so it's super convenient 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.400
 and it smells super good there I go quickly or 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:34.140
 not here in the same brand as my 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.270
 shampoo area so it's a detangler 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.620
 that by applying this price finally in 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.320
 hell mix because there are two 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 phases it was called so after being 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.440
 washed the hair it just marks super 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.180
 well I used it as never I can 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.300
 very very long because I live endlessly 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.160
 which are intertwined and his 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.360
 share in three cuts brush so much 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.890
 it is convenient 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.630
 so I really could to everyone 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.760
 it costs 10 euros and it is also in 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.760
 sale in hairdressers and disorders 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.590
 so me then when my hair is 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.060
 dry I use mitonne l'oreal so 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.010
 it's a hair oil 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.310
 rebellious but 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.519
 Here I used before mixing them 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.460
 hair and that makes the hair super 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.220
 sweet and it highlights but reflections 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.680
 blond and suddenly I think it's too good 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:34.110
 and I say them or not how everything is 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:36.900
 that among friends here and it costs to 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.680
 about 7 euros and finally he is 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.070
 black 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.760
 wendel life so that's the spread is 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.190
 salted baguette 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.210
 there are others that are for the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.070
 curls and for hairstyles I thought 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.490
 and so in fact we applied it precedes 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.320
 hair styled by ac / dc hair earlier 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.660
 and it helps to keep smoothing 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.440
 when it rains and where everything and it works 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.930
 really well actually 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.479
 well there I have not read I read because 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.669
 I love it I say now we were greeting a 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.919
 a little late but inhabitant attached to 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.750
 movement 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.600
 here and see that I tell myself the hair 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.979
 I'm going to show you my sister bed that 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.710
 is the remington it's the one that makes 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.199
 loops because he's red he's 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.560
 fine enough and it allows you to make the most 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.419
 for me it can go up to 230 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.620
 degrees and one can smooth one's hair 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.419
 even when 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.570
 wet hair because there are some 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:37.169
 little holes to let the 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.820
 evaporation and it is sold with a cd 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.820
 which explains how to deflate 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:46.320
 I explain this hairstyle to do with 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.430
 so it's really practical really 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.320
 straightener it is sassum sy dredge the bone I 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.780
 the payais forty red I 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.030
 believe it goes when we remember more 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.240
 too much he bought in supermarkets 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.240
 it seems to me and they also show 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.650
 up to 230 degrees good it is 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.789
 normally we can not do two 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.199
 loops with but I do it anyway 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.620
 here 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.889
 and you can also smooth your hair 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.550
 wet 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:24.090
 so it's quite practical and in addition it 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:26.000

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.410
