underneath the scarf and I put a bobby
pin<00:01:57.260> back<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.040> measures<00:01:58.190> the

pin back there and it measures the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.860 
pin back there and it measures the
further<00:02:00.680> back<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.070> tuck<00:02:01.550> it<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.510> more

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
further back you tuck it the more

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.620 
further back you tuck it the more
security<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:04.220> actually<00:02:04.940> if<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.270> don't<00:02:05.450> just

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
security and actually if you don't just

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.980 
security and actually if you don't just
want<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.710> be<00:02:06.830> super<00:02:07.160> secure<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:08.720> tuck

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it and bobby pin it and I think that's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.830

what<00:02:10.670> I'm<00:02:10.759> going<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.910> do<00:02:11.090> because<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.780> don't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
what I'm going to do because I don't

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.980 
what I'm going to do because I don't
want<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.290> move<00:02:14.200> okay

want it to move okay

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.900 
want it to move okay
so<00:02:17.990> then<00:02:18.170> you'll<00:02:18.320> end<00:02:18.560> up<00:02:18.740> with<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:20.180> look

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:47.430 

this<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.780> look<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.340> first<00:02:27.640> look

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:03:05.130
