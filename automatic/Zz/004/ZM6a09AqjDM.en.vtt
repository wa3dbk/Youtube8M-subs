00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 if you can't play at all 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.780
 guitar and god and we will teach you hello 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 my name is morphi all my life i play on 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 guitar playing brought me a lot 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
 free beer of the day i will teach you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.230
 playing guitar just frets and guitar 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 are counted from pegs 1 lat 2 la third 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.529
 fret 4 string on the guitar are considered the bottom 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 the thinnest string 1 then 2 3 and so on 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.060
 6 so start now we will play 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.710
 first chord the first chord is called 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.489
 up to c 5 string 3 fret 4 string 2 fret 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 second string 1 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.780
 notice not one finger not 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 touched another string 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.809
 if this happens it will be very 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.730
 the ugly sound of that we start with the fact that 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 correctly put your hand to hand 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.800
 every finger was right 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 put on one fret and you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.420
 automatically the hand will stand in the right 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 position remember this position 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 she will always be with you right hand wow 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.549
 britain on guitar put your fingers on 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.220
 strings means there will be a sharp sound 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.370
 there will be a softer sound 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.160
 well, I play somewhere in the middle 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.190
 let's start learning some sorting 5 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.040
 string 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.760
 third string first two then again 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.860
 third string 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.660
 simple brute force sounds fine 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
 pay attention so that the fingers do not 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.450
 hit the adjacent strings clamp chord 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.450
 c 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.640
 then carry this finger on 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.909
 third string 2 fret play the same 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.909
 bust 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.580
 so we found the most simple 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.610
 chord sequence which 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.320
 can play acoustic guitar 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.490
 play one brute once 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.590
 this one 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.969
 without pausing immediately go to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.259
 second year 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.259
 without pausing, go back 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.680
 do not pause come back 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.560
 not to lose the rhythm I advise 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.360
 knocking it out with his foot is okay 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 if brute force fails first 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.560
 Can we just fuck first 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 let's start with the fact that we remember a little bit 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.520
 this search and this sequence 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.470
 chords and a couple of days and by play if u 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.330
 You have difficulty with desire 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.580
 chords try to carry your guitar 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.290
 to the master if this is the old guitar the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.500
 master will help you will be much 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.020
 easier to add two chords first chord 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.330
 the first string and the second string is clamped 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.030
 on the first fret the third string is clamped 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.520
 on the second fret it sounds very much there 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.060
 beautiful simple chord brute a little 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:07.390
 changes instead of 5 strings and play 4 not 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.480
 changing these chords you get used no me 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.310
 their dick knows how to say these by the way 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.340
 chords are chords of a song which 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.150
