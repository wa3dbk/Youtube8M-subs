00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.270
 do not 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.550
 if you are interested in a car 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.040
 sports and purist the new alligator gt4 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.890
 is what you are looking for comes with a 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.080
 very modern technique of medium engine like 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.690
 in the supercars and the cars of 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.310
 Formula 1 and is characterized by a 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.770
 huge power of 385 horses plus 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.290
 has a spoiler that generates load 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.329
 descending aerodynamics that a lot is 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 you need on a race track and 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.060
 now you accelerate that same house 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060
 no no 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.490
 It is started naturally with the key of the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.910
 left immediately hear the 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:56.000
 385 horses and the 429 newtons metro 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.840
 maximum torque and feel also of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.840
 Immediate to dance 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.360
 here in portugal this track of portimao 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.970
 is really very demanding and poses 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.420
 great challenges to both the driver and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420
 to the car 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 let's see before starting, deactivated the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.890
 electronic assistants then it remains 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 very clear what dynamic qualities it possesses 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.570
 the gt 4 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.140
 the entrance to the gt family of porsche is 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.480
 called from now Cayman 74 is the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.680
 first boss of the alligator series and since 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.410
 already the new benchmark in its segment the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.630
 suspension is very firm and reminds me of 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.630
 the one of a true racing car 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.170
 atlanta 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.170
 very precise address 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.110
 the curves can face 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.360
 superbly and spin accelerate and then 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.550
 survive a little but the car 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.900
 it remains really low 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 dietrich with cody to a long curve 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 to the right we accelerate in the exit 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.810
 and immediately we feel the burden 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.490
 aerodynamic forward and back this car 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.569
 generates more than 100 kilos of cargo 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:43.629
 aerodynamics at a speed of 289 290 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.629
 now to the straight at 245 degrees 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.250
 the alligator carries the genes of 911 gt3 its 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.250
 big brother of him comes the chassis 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.000
 the brakes and the rear spoiler its engine 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.950
 six cylinders of 38 liters and 283 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.060
 kilowatts of power comes from the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.550
 race that acceleration from 0 to 100 in 44 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.940
 seconds 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.850
 and an interesting detail although the box 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.130
 of changes is manual of 6 speeds to 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.390
 slow down the car accelerates 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 electronically a bit and this facilitates 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.750
 things 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.390
 the porsche gt 4 is a sports 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.940
 exceptional and the presentation was 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.460
 sensational toured the northern section 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.690
 of the nÃ¼rbÃ¼rgring circuit in only 7 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.690
 minutes and 40 seconds 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.900
 change of scene training with a 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.050
 smartphone application 7 tract 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.060
 optional precision makes it possible to take 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.440
 times and the visualization of the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.070
 driving with a smart cell phone 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.860
 here active the analysis that you see 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.400
 directly on the screen and I see data 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:08.470
 of telemetry such as speed the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.330
 steering braking or acceleration 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.570
 or to start the video from any 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.620
 point also runs harmonized with the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.820
 auto data operating it is very simple 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.650
 every client can understand the 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.250
 application immediately and see how 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.250
 driven 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.810
 the cheapest entry car to the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.970
 family that you from porsche is called now 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.970
 gt4 alligator 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.830
 all right 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.160
 conclusion this is a car that really 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.200
 have fun with him you can walk very well 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.370
 here on the track but also on the 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.950
 street slope in germany about 85 thousand 700 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.970
 euros and in view of so much money I'm going to 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.970
 take another turn
