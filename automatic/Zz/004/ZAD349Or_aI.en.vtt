00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
some frame modifications today that's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.700 
some frame modifications today that's
the<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.260> done<00:00:42.710> I've

the first thing we got to get done I've

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
the first thing we got to get done I've
ordered<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.160> new<00:00:44.309> sprocket

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
ordered a new sprocket

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.170 
ordered a new sprocket
it's<00:00:47.780> considerably<00:00:48.780> bigger<00:00:50.090> hopefully<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it's considerably bigger hopefully it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.250 
it's considerably bigger hopefully it
will<00:00:51.239> help<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.800> get<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:53.460> gearing<00:00:53.820> down<00:00:57.260> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
will help me get my gearing down this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.689 
will help me get my gearing down this
old<00:00:58.469> sprocket<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.809> too<00:01:00.809> fast<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:02.129> don't

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
old sprocket it was too fast and I don't

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.200 
old sprocket it was too fast and I don't
have<00:01:03.149> enough<00:01:03.390> torque<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.960> sprocket

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
have enough torque with this sprocket

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
have enough torque with this sprocket
now<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> also<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.170> bigger<00:01:07.439> sprocket<00:01:07.979> I'm

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
now I also with this bigger sprocket I'm

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.230 
now I also with this bigger sprocket I'm
gonna<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:09.840> changes<00:01:10.380> because

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
gonna have to do some changes because

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020 
gonna have to do some changes because
where<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.390> chain<00:01:12.659> runs<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.820> most

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
where my chain runs down it will most

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.859 
where my chain runs down it will most
likely<00:01:15.200> run<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.100> engine<00:01:17.720> because<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
likely run into the engine because of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.590 
likely run into the engine because of
how<00:01:19.229> much<00:01:19.320> bigger<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.830> sprocket<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
how much bigger this sprocket is so I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600 
how much bigger this sprocket is so I
have<00:01:21.630> some<00:01:22.020> big<00:01:22.170> changes<00:01:22.560> planned<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.009> today

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610

old sprocket new sprocket quite a big

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:35.810 
old sprocket new sprocket quite a big
difference

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

inches this is so I can fit my new big
sprocket<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.970> chain

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
sprocket in and the chain

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.450 
sprocket in and the chain

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
will have to move my chain tensioner yet

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.690 
will have to move my chain tensioner yet
again<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.820> that's<00:02:18.000> okay<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.110> um<00:02:19.640> made<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
again but that's okay so um made a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.150 
again but that's okay so um made a
couple<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> big<00:02:21.150> steps<00:02:21.360> forward<00:02:22.160> getting

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
couple of big steps forward getting

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.670 
couple of big steps forward getting
close<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> being<00:02:23.640> done<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:24.000> today<00:02:24.530> we'll<00:02:25.530> see

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
close to being done for today we'll see

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.540 
close to being done for today we'll see
how<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:25.890> more<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.640> done<00:02:28.340> okay<00:02:29.340> so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
how much more I can get done okay so

how much more I can get done okay so
here's<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.360> X<00:02:30.690> will<00:02:31.010> kind<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.070> mocked<00:02:32.670> up

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
here's the X will kind of mocked up

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.140 
here's the X will kind of mocked up
again<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.950> bearing<00:02:35.310> hangars<00:02:35.700> are<00:02:35.910> now<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
again the bearing hangars are now the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.800 
again the bearing hangars are now the
entire<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:37.050> back<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:39.150> what<00:02:39.240> I've<00:02:39.330> been<00:02:39.360> doing

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
entire way back so what I've been doing

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.050 
entire way back so what I've been doing
is<00:02:40.380> I've<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.740> been<00:02:40.890> making<00:02:41.220> new<00:02:41.370> braces<00:02:41.910> and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.720 
is I've just been making new braces and
pieces<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:43.470> hold<00:02:43.680> everything<00:02:43.980> together<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
pieces to hold everything together a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.100 
pieces to hold everything together a
little<00:02:45.300> better<00:02:45.570> than<00:02:45.780> last<00:02:45.959> time<00:02:47.900> say<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> got

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
little better than last time say I got

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.650 
little better than last time say I got
this<00:02:49.820> reinforcing<00:02:50.820> piece<00:02:51.030> here<00:02:51.239> across<00:02:51.450> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
this reinforcing piece here across to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.810 
this reinforcing piece here across to
the<00:02:51.750> back<00:02:51.959> because<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.040> was<00:02:53.100> starting<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.580> bend

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
the back because it was starting to bend

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.570 
the back because it was starting to bend
here<00:02:54.090> from<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.450> pressure<00:02:54.800> from<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.980> chain

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
here from the pressure from the chain

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.690 
here from the pressure from the chain
here<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:59.610> else<00:03:01.070> yeah<00:03:02.070> if<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.489> see<00:03:02.670> I

here and what else yeah if you can see I

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.300 
here and what else yeah if you can see I
got<00:03:02.940> my<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.630> got<00:03:03.930> my<00:03:04.080> big<00:03:04.410> sprocket<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:05.070> down

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
got my I got my big sprocket on down

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.890 
got my I got my big sprocket on down
here<00:03:06.500> clears<00:03:07.500> everything<00:03:08.450> well<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.780> to

it's not that bad right now actually but

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.979 
it's not that bad right now actually but
um<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:17.549> yeah<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.209> actually<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.540> got<00:03:18.750> lucky

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
um so yeah and I actually I got lucky

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.259 
um so yeah and I actually I got lucky
that's<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.440> original<00:03:19.560> chain<00:03:20.070> length<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.670> it

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
that's the original chain length in it

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.180 
that's the original chain length in it
fits<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> completely<00:03:22.380> different<00:03:22.799> sprocket

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
fits for a completely different sprocket

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.970 
fits for a completely different sprocket
size<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.230> being<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.380> different<00:03:25.709> mounting

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
size and being in a different mounting

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.140 
size and being in a different mounting
location<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.970> got<00:03:27.810> lucky<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> guess

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
location so I got lucky on that I guess

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.910 
location so I got lucky on that I guess
all<00:03:30.150> right<00:03:30.390> I'm<00:03:31.019> gonna<00:03:31.200> put<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.500> thing<00:03:31.739> back

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
we're gonna see how my new drivetrain

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.620 
we're gonna see how my new drivetrain
modifications<00:03:37.799> work<00:03:38.370> out<00:03:38.580> see<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:39.540> they

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
modifications work out see if they

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.170 
modifications work out see if they

little bit cut them a little shorter I'm
gonna<00:03:54.120> mount<00:03:54.299> them<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.720> bearing<00:03:55.500> anger<00:03:55.769> is

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
gonna mount them on the bearing anger is

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.070 
gonna mount them on the bearing anger is
just<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.220> different<00:03:56.370> spot<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:57.540> little<00:03:57.930> bit

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
brace mounts that went on the backside

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.250 
brace mounts that went on the backside
here<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:15.180> as<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.390> can<00:04:15.510> see<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.750> mounted<00:04:16.140> them

here but as you can see I mounted them

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.469 
here but as you can see I mounted them
in<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> front<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.180> didn't<00:04:18.419> get

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479
