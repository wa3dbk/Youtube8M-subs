hey Micah Mike Scarberry

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.180 
hey Micah Mike Scarberry
I<00:00:10.429> had<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.090> question<00:00:11.360> on

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
I had a question on

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.009 
I had a question on
20<00:00:12.610> I<00:00:12.639> thought<00:00:13.000> it<00:00:13.120> answered<00:00:13.480> with<00:00:13.629> a<00:00:13.660> video

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
20 I thought it answered with a video

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.499 
20 I thought it answered with a video
but<00:00:14.230> now<00:00:15.190> end<00:00:15.429> point<00:00:15.670> out<00:00:15.789> a<00:00:15.820> few<00:00:16.059> other<00:00:16.090> things

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509 
but now end point out a few other things

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.769 
but now end point out a few other things
about<00:00:16.720> this<00:00:17.020> carburetor<00:00:17.560> I<00:00:18.490> have<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.939> customer

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
about this carburetor I have a customer

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.319 
about this carburetor I have a customer
that<00:00:20.080> rebuilders<00:00:21.070> his<00:00:21.700> carburetor<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:22.919> it<00:00:24.329> at

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
that rebuilders his carburetor and it at

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.960 
that rebuilders his carburetor and it at
idle<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:25.960> would<00:00:26.110> just<00:00:26.320> kind<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:26.789> bogged<00:00:27.789> down

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
idle it would just kind of bogged down

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.280 
idle it would just kind of bogged down
and<00:00:28.419> finally<00:00:28.660> die

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
and finally die

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.859 
and finally die
I<00:00:29.320> suspect<00:00:30.250> it's<00:00:30.700> getting<00:00:31.059> too<00:00:31.239> much<00:00:31.450> fuel

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
I suspect it's getting too much fuel

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.729 
I suspect it's getting too much fuel
that's<00:00:32.140> over<00:00:32.469> that<00:00:32.860> it's<00:00:33.040> flooding<00:00:34.739> that's

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
that's over that it's flooding that's

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.380 
that's over that it's flooding that's
probably<00:00:36.520> what<00:00:36.790> it's<00:00:36.940> doing<00:00:37.329> that's<00:00:37.540> my<00:00:37.719> guess

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
probably what it's doing that's my guess

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.150 
probably what it's doing that's my guess
one<00:00:40.390> thing<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:40.690> might<00:00:40.870> check<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.440> after<00:00:42.070> it

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
one thing you might check is after it

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.939 
one thing you might check is after it
dies<00:00:42.370> there's<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:42.850> smell<00:00:43.120> gas<00:00:43.480> see<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:44.589> that's

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
dies there's a smell gas see that that's

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.560 
dies there's a smell gas see that that's
an<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:45.309> would<00:00:45.550> be<00:00:45.670> an<00:00:45.760> indication<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.449> a

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
an that would be an indication of a

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.950 
an that would be an indication of a
flooding<00:00:46.989> so<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:48.730> on<00:00:48.909> from<00:00:49.210> there<00:00:49.480> let's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
flooding so going on from there let's

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.669 
flooding so going on from there let's
assume<00:00:50.289> that's<00:00:50.559> correct<00:00:51.089> I<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.530> point

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
assume that's correct I want to point

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.559 
assume that's correct I want to point
out<00:00:53.890> some<00:00:54.370> of<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.550> things<00:00:54.609> that<00:00:55.089> will<00:00:55.210> make<00:00:55.420> it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
out some of the things that will make it

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.559 
out some of the things that will make it
do<00:00:55.719> that<00:00:55.989> first<00:00:56.859> of<00:00:57.010> all<00:00:57.539> flooding<00:00:58.539> just

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
do that first of all flooding just

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.239 
do that first of all flooding just
situation<00:00:59.260> where<00:00:59.589> it's<00:00:59.679> getting<00:00:59.800> too<00:01:00.069> much

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
situation where it's getting too much

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.759 
situation where it's getting too much
fuel<00:01:00.579> that's<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.329> bottom<00:01:01.659> line

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
fuel that's the bottom line

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.830 
fuel that's the bottom line
it's<00:01:03.519> not<00:01:06.060> anything<00:01:07.060> tricky<00:01:07.330> it's<00:01:07.630> just

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
it's not anything tricky it's just

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.990 
it's not anything tricky it's just
getting<00:01:08.170> too<00:01:08.290> much<00:01:08.470> fuel<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.130> there's<00:01:09.640> only

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
getting too much fuel and there's only

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.030 
getting too much fuel and there's only
so<00:01:10.210> many<00:01:10.479> things<00:01:10.630> that'll<00:01:11.110> make<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.320> do<00:01:11.590> that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
so many things that'll make it do that

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.770 
so many things that'll make it do that
number<00:01:12.460> one<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.850> fuel<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.270> coming<00:01:13.630> through

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
number one the fuel is coming through

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.220 
number one the fuel is coming through
the<00:01:13.930> needle<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.290> seat<00:01:14.530> here<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:16.020> real<00:01:17.020> long

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
the needle and seat here a real long

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.200 
the needle and seat here a real long
shot<00:01:17.260> on<00:01:17.800> this<00:01:17.980> I<00:01:18.250> said<00:01:18.460> just<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:18.880> came<00:01:19.030> to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
shot on this I said just as it came to

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.810 
shot on this I said just as it came to
mind<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.830> happen<00:01:20.980> to<00:01:21.130> put<00:01:21.430> on<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.610> new

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
mind is if you happen to put on a new

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.660 
mind is if you happen to put on a new
car<00:01:22.090> excuse<00:01:22.660> me<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.990> new<00:01:23.170> fuel<00:01:23.410> pump

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
car excuse me a new fuel pump

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.490 
car excuse me a new fuel pump
yes<00:01:25.240> possibility<00:01:25.900> it's<00:01:26.020> putting<00:01:26.200> out<00:01:26.290> too

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
yes possibility it's putting out too

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.740 
yes possibility it's putting out too
much<00:01:26.650> fuel<00:01:26.950> pressure<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:28.450> would<00:01:28.600> hold

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
much fuel pressure and that would hold

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.510 
much fuel pressure and that would hold
the<00:01:28.930> needle<00:01:29.230> out<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.040> check<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.400> other

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
the needle out so check that the other

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.640 
the needle out so check that the other
thing<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.910> these<00:01:34.090> they<00:01:34.390> most<00:01:35.260> of<00:01:35.320> them<00:01:35.440> came

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
thing on these they most of them came

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.820 
thing on these they most of them came
with<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.830> nitro<00:01:36.250> fill<00:01:36.490> float<00:01:37.440> you<00:01:38.440> generally

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
with a nitro fill float you generally

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.190 
with a nitro fill float you generally
should<00:01:38.890> replace<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.760> when<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.690> rebuild<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
should replace that when you rebuild the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.010 
should replace that when you rebuild the
carburetor<00:01:42.240> here's<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.390> problem<00:01:43.750> on<00:01:43.840> these

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
carburetor here's the problem on these

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.930 
carburetor here's the problem on these
1920s<00:01:44.980> they're<00:01:45.220> generally<00:01:45.580> not<00:01:45.730> available

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
1920s they're generally not available

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.620 
1920s they're generally not available
these<00:01:46.480> floats<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:48.000> there's<00:01:49.000> two<00:01:49.420> different

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
these floats and there's two different

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600 
these floats and there's two different
types<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.230> floats<00:01:50.530> there's<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.190> one<00:01:51.400> there's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
types of floats there's this one there's

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.010 
types of floats there's this one there's
a<00:01:51.670> little<00:01:51.880> older<00:01:52.360> style<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:55.780> not

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
a little older style that are not

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.180 
a little older style that are not
produced<00:01:56.470> anymore

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
produced anymore

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.110 
produced anymore
I<00:01:57.220> do<00:01:58.000> have<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.390> limited<00:01:58.840> supply<00:01:59.230> of<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.530> older

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
I do have a limited supply of the older

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.450 
I do have a limited supply of the older
style<00:02:01.120> still<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.840> one<00:02:02.050> here<00:02:02.410> I<00:02:02.770> don't<00:02:03.130> have

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
style still this one here I don't have

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.210 
style still this one here I don't have
any<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.850> at<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.150> moment<00:02:04.540> any<00:02:05.260> rate<00:02:05.500> these

any of at the moment any rate these

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.070 
any of at the moment any rate these
night<00:02:06.490> refills<00:02:06.850> they<00:02:07.090> tend<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.450> absorb<00:02:07.660> fuel

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
night refills they tend to absorb fuel

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.859 
night refills they tend to absorb fuel
over<00:02:08.440> time<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:10.209> course<00:02:10.479> they'll<00:02:10.659> get

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
over time and of course they'll get

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.920 
over time and of course they'll get
heavy<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.970> cause<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.120> all<00:02:13.300> kinds<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.720> weird

heavy and cause you all kinds of weird
problems<00:02:14.470> I've<00:02:15.340> learned<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:17.170> hard<00:02:17.200> way

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
problems I've learned this the hard way

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.979 
problems I've learned this the hard way
just<00:02:18.730> on<00:02:18.879> carburetors<00:02:19.450> I've<00:02:19.569> had<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:19.870> much

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
just on carburetors I've had so much

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.900 
just on carburetors I've had so much
trouble<00:02:20.290> with<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.740> mind<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.190> replace<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
trouble with just mind out replace the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.690 
trouble with just mind out replace the
float<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.210> everything's<00:02:22.840> good<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.170> go<00:02:23.700> like

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
float and everything's good to go like

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.830 
float and everything's good to go like
say<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.060> problem<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.390> going<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.600> be

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
say the problem is going to be

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.559 
say the problem is going to be
anyone<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:28.110> at<00:02:29.110> any<00:02:29.319> rate<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.830> can't<00:02:30.569> weigh

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
anyone so at any rate you can't weigh

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.540 
anyone so at any rate you can't weigh
him<00:02:31.750> or<00:02:31.930> anything<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.470> don't<00:02:32.500> well<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.040> guess<00:02:33.400> you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
him or anything I don't well I guess you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.100 
him or anything I don't well I guess you
could<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.790> don't<00:02:33.910> know<00:02:34.120> what<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.450> grams<00:02:34.720> are<00:02:34.959> on

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
could I don't know what the grams are on

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.089 
could I don't know what the grams are on
this<00:02:35.260> I'll<00:02:35.470> try<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.800> find<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.220> any<00:02:36.610> rate

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
this I'll try and find out but any rate

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.920 
this I'll try and find out but any rate
these<00:02:39.099> are<00:02:39.310> solid<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.150> shaking<00:02:40.629> them<00:02:40.720> isn't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
these are solid so shaking them isn't

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.320 
these are solid so shaking them isn't
going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.410> any<00:02:41.560> good<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.400> as<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> rule<00:02:43.269> of

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
going to do any good so as a rule of

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.509 
going to do any good so as a rule of
thumb<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:44.019> replace<00:02:44.379> them<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.650> keep<00:02:45.310> your

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
thumb we just replace them so keep your

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.520 
thumb we just replace them so keep your
eye<00:02:45.549> out<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:45.849> new<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.540> if<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.959> find<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.379> new

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
eye out for new and if you find a new

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.699 
eye out for new and if you find a new
and<00:02:47.709> hang<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.340> all<00:02:49.030> right<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:50.470> course

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
and hang on to it all right so of course

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.339 
and hang on to it all right so of course
your<00:02:50.860> float<00:02:51.099> level<00:02:51.310> now<00:02:51.640> typically<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:53.170> want

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
your float level now typically you want

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.530 
your float level now typically you want
to<00:02:53.410> go<00:02:53.500> by<00:02:53.650> your<00:02:53.799> specifications<00:02:54.760> but<00:02:55.060> all

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to go by your specifications but all

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.360 
to go by your specifications but all
else<00:02:55.720> fails<00:02:56.080> if<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.590> float<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.040> sitting

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
else fails if your float is sitting

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.990 
else fails if your float is sitting
level<00:02:57.519> when<00:02:58.060> your<00:02:59.310> carburetors<00:03:00.310> upside<00:03:00.760> down

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000

you're<00:03:01.660> good<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.049> go<00:03:02.079> okay<00:03:02.890> one<00:03:03.730> thing<00:03:03.970> you

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
you're good to go okay one thing you

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.710 
you're good to go okay one thing you
should<00:03:04.900> try<00:03:05.079> is<00:03:06.090> hold<00:03:07.090> your<00:03:07.209> foot<00:03:07.390> closed

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
should try is hold your foot closed

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.580 
should try is hold your foot closed
gently<00:03:08.230> because<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:09.489> got<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.670> Viton<00:03:10.060> tip

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
gently because you got a Viton tip

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.930 
gently because you got a Viton tip
needle<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:12.010> don't<00:03:12.190> want<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.400> damage<00:03:12.579> it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
needle and you don't want to damage it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.119 
needle and you don't want to damage it
so<00:03:13.150> hold<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.599> close<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.170> blow<00:03:14.739> through<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
so hold it close and blow through the

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.390 
so hold it close and blow through the
inlet<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:17.110> should<00:03:17.349> be<00:03:17.500> stopping<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.099> fuel

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
inlet and it should be stopping the fuel

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.640 
inlet and it should be stopping the fuel
if<00:03:19.060> not<00:03:19.360> maybe<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:19.780> got<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.959> needle<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.440> seat

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
if not maybe you got a needle and seat

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.069 
if not maybe you got a needle and seat
problem<00:03:21.160> no<00:03:21.459> here's<00:03:22.329> something<00:03:22.629> that<00:03:22.720> happens

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
problem no here's something that happens

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.780 
problem no here's something that happens
a<00:03:23.200> lot<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:24.069> get<00:03:24.190> all<00:03:24.370> done<00:03:24.549> with<00:03:24.760> your

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
a lot you get all done with your

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.030 
a lot you get all done with your
carburetor<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.720> put<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.379> on<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.650> car<00:03:26.860> you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
carburetor you put it on the car you

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.400 
carburetor you put it on the car you
start<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.519> up<00:03:27.640> all<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.510> crud<00:03:28.810> from<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.200> gas

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
start it up all the crud from the gas

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.620 
start it up all the crud from the gas
tank<00:03:29.739> runs<00:03:30.130> up<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.609> ends<00:03:31.299> up<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.569> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
tank runs up and ends up in the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.849 
tank runs up and ends up in the
carburetor<00:03:32.019> again<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.010> what<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.269> is

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
carburetor again and what you have is

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.280 
carburetor again and what you have is
junk<00:03:35.859> in<00:03:36.010> your<00:03:36.040> needle<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.489> seat<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.600> if<00:03:38.079> you

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
junk in your needle and seat so if you

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990 
junk in your needle and seat so if you
have<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.560> problem<00:03:38.859> right<00:03:39.010> after<00:03:39.400> rebuild<00:03:39.850> of

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
have this problem right after rebuild of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.470 
have this problem right after rebuild of
a<00:03:40.120> flooding<00:03:41.130> take<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.310> apart<00:03:42.639> take<00:03:43.269> your

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
a flooding take it apart take your

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.089 
a flooding take it apart take your
needle<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:43.750> seat<00:03:43.989> out<00:03:44.170> clean<00:03:44.560> up<00:03:44.739> put<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.069> back

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
needle and seat out clean up put it back

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.890 
needle and seat out clean up put it back
in<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.700> if<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:45.940> doesn't<00:03:46.180> take<00:03:46.480> care<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.750> your

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
in see if that doesn't take care of your

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.490 
in see if that doesn't take care of your
problem<00:03:47.319> it<00:03:48.130> happens<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.579> lot<00:03:48.609> so<00:03:49.500> that's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
problem it happens a lot so that's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.330 
problem it happens a lot so that's
basically<00:03:52.260> right<00:03:53.260> off<00:03:53.410> hand<00:03:53.709> about<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.130> only

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
basically right off hand about the only

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.180 
basically right off hand about the only
thing<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:55.139> can<00:03:56.139> think<00:03:56.319> of<00:03:56.560> this<00:03:56.739> gonna<00:03:56.889> cause

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
thing I can think of this gonna cause

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.400 
thing I can think of this gonna cause
this<00:03:57.370> thing<00:03:57.639> to<00:03:57.790> flood<00:03:58.060> so<00:03:58.989> you're<00:03:59.139> gonna<00:03:59.230> have

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
this thing to flood so you're gonna have

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.839 
this thing to flood so you're gonna have
to<00:03:59.500> check<00:03:59.739> all<00:03:59.950> those<00:04:00.099> things<00:04:00.400> out<00:04:00.609> some

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
to check all those things out some

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.300 
to check all those things out some
easier<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.359> others<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:02.650> other<00:04:02.799> thing<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.130> want

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
easier and others one other thing I want

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.250 
easier and others one other thing I want
to<00:04:03.400> point<00:04:03.609> out<00:04:03.849> is<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.120> got<00:04:04.389> two<00:04:04.660> balls<00:04:04.930> in

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
to point out is you got two balls in

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.490 
to point out is you got two balls in
your<00:04:05.290> metering<00:04:06.130> block<00:04:06.459> here<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.260> your<00:04:08.260> bigger

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
your metering block here and your bigger

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.379 
your metering block here and your bigger
ball<00:04:08.739> should<00:04:09.010> go<00:04:09.160> out<00:04:09.280> in<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.669> shorter<00:04:10.090> tube

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
ball should go out in the shorter tube

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.390 
ball should go out in the shorter tube
here<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.230> if<00:04:11.349> you<00:04:11.470> took<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.709> apart

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
here so if you took that apart

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.190 
here so if you took that apart
you<00:04:12.790> took<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.150> balls<00:04:13.359> out<00:04:13.540> make<00:04:13.780> sure<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:14.079> got

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
you took the balls out make sure you got

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.250 
you took the balls out make sure you got
the<00:04:14.260> big<00:04:14.560> one<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.069> smaller<00:04:16.030> tube<00:04:16.419> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
the big one in the smaller tube the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.110 
the big one in the smaller tube the
other<00:04:17.440> thing<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:18.190> make<00:04:18.609> sure<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.450> your<00:04:21.120> donor

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
other thing is make sure that your donor

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.170 
other thing is make sure that your donor
if<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.300> can<00:04:22.419> take<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.690> out<00:04:22.870> real<00:04:23.110> quick<00:04:24.180> maybe

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
if I can take this out real quick maybe

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.620 
if I can take this out real quick maybe
not<00:04:25.389> okay<00:04:25.599> you<00:04:25.930> got<00:04:26.440> your<00:04:27.150> economizer<00:04:28.150> here

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
not okay you got your economizer here

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.060 
not okay you got your economizer here
and<00:04:29.099> it's<00:04:30.099> pushing<00:04:30.400> down<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.870> call<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.860> power

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
and it's pushing down on a call to power

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.140 
and it's pushing down on a call to power
valve<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.729> what<00:04:34.330> happens<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.990> at

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
valve and what happens is at

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.409 
valve and what happens is at
idle<00:04:36.900> this<00:04:37.110> thing<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.560> pulled<00:04:37.860> up<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:41.419> you

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
idle this thing is pulled up and and you

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.510 
idle this thing is pulled up and and you
don't<00:04:42.600> have<00:04:42.750> any<00:04:42.960> fuel<00:04:43.320> extra<00:04:43.830> fuel<00:04:44.070> going<00:04:44.280> in

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
don't have any fuel extra fuel going in

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.700 
don't have any fuel extra fuel going in
here<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:44.910> then<00:04:45.030> at<00:04:45.150> higher<00:04:45.330> speeds<00:04:45.840> you're

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
here and then at higher speeds you're

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.600 
here and then at higher speeds you're
you<00:04:47.010> lose<00:04:47.220> vacuum<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.840> will<00:04:49.280> drop<00:04:50.280> down

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
you lose vacuum and this will drop down

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.030 
you lose vacuum and this will drop down
and<00:04:51.120> allow<00:04:51.360> more<00:04:51.570> fuel<00:04:51.900> into<00:04:52.229> your<00:04:52.260> metering

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
and allow more fuel into your metering

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.200 
and allow more fuel into your metering
block<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:55.220> one<00:04:56.220> thing<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.610> might<00:04:56.639> want<00:04:57.120> to

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
block so one thing you might want to

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.340 
block so one thing you might want to
check<00:04:57.510> is<00:04:58.229> make<00:04:58.710> sure<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.580> hole<00:05:00.350> here

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
check is make sure that the hole here

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.430 
check is make sure that the hole here
this<00:05:02.010> is<00:05:02.160> your<00:05:02.280> vacuum<00:05:02.490> hole<00:05:02.910> right<00:05:03.150> here<00:05:03.440> blow

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
this is your vacuum hole right here blow

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.900 
this is your vacuum hole right here blow
air<00:05:04.620> through<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:04.979> makes<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.250> get<00:05:05.430> air<00:05:05.639> all<00:05:05.820> the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
air through it makes you get air all the

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.730 
air through it makes you get air all the
way<00:05:06.060> through<00:05:07.520> let's<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.789> I<00:05:09.090> believe<00:05:09.500> on<00:05:10.500> this

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
way through let's see I believe on this

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.490 
way through let's see I believe on this
1920<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.699> actually<00:05:12.060> starts<00:05:12.419> right<00:05:12.630> here<00:05:12.660> so

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
1920 it actually starts right here so

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.260 
1920 it actually starts right here so
you<00:05:13.590> want<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.979> have<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.130> good<00:05:14.400> passage<00:05:14.940> through

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
you want to have a good passage through

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.730 
you want to have a good passage through
there<00:05:15.449> make<00:05:15.690> sure<00:05:15.720> your<00:05:16.020> gaskets<00:05:16.560> on

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
there make sure your gaskets on

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.029 
there make sure your gaskets on
correctly<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.639> everything<00:05:17.940> because<00:05:19.039> if

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
correctly and everything because if

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.490 
correctly and everything because if
that's<00:05:20.280> not<00:05:20.490> done<00:05:20.850> correctly<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.990> vacuum

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
that's not done correctly and the vacuum

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.879 
that's not done correctly and the vacuum
is<00:05:22.710> not<00:05:22.740> pulling<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.460> up<00:05:24.139> then<00:05:25.139> you're<00:05:25.770> gonna

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
is not pulling that up then you're gonna

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.159 
is not pulling that up then you're gonna
get<00:05:26.100> too<00:05:26.310> much<00:05:26.490> fuel<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:26.970> way<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.900> there<00:05:28.080> you

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
get too much fuel that way so there you

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.379 
get too much fuel that way so there you
go<00:05:28.350> that<00:05:28.530> points<00:05:28.919> out<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.430> few<00:05:29.669> things<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.180> can

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
go that points out a few things that can

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.460 
go that points out a few things that can
be<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.600> problem<00:05:30.870> your<00:05:31.740> idle<00:05:32.010> mixture<00:05:32.160> screw<00:05:33.470> you

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
be a problem your idle mixture screw you

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.650 
be a problem your idle mixture screw you
know<00:05:34.620> got<00:05:35.160> a<00:05:35.190> little<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.669> rough<00:05:36.030> idle<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.510> all

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
know got a little a rough idle is all

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.700 
know got a little a rough idle is all
you're<00:05:36.810> going<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.050> get<00:05:37.940> if<00:05:38.940> if<00:05:39.780> you<00:05:40.050> suspect<00:05:40.530> is

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
you're going to get if if you suspect is

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.339 
you're going to get if if you suspect is
dying<00:05:41.010> yeah<00:05:41.700> I<00:05:41.729> mean<00:05:41.970> if<00:05:42.090> it's<00:05:42.270> dying<00:05:42.599> then

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
dying yeah I mean if it's dying then

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.690 
dying yeah I mean if it's dying then
what<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.620> want<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:43.889> do<00:05:43.979> is<00:05:44.099> start<00:05:44.340> turning

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
what you want to do is start turning

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.089 
what you want to do is start turning
your<00:05:44.820> screw<00:05:45.120> back<00:05:45.330> in<00:05:45.389> a<00:05:45.660> little<00:05:46.080> at<00:05:46.229> time<00:05:46.530> or

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
your screw back in a little at time or

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.610 
your screw back in a little at time or
out<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:48.210> may<00:05:48.599> have<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:48.900> try<00:05:49.139> it<00:05:49.200> several

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
out you may have to try it several

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.589 
out you may have to try it several
places<00:05:49.889> but<00:05:51.200> it's<00:05:52.200> not<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.770> touchy<00:05:53.099> so<00:05:53.970> if

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
places but it's not that touchy so if

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.510 
places but it's not that touchy so if
you<00:05:54.810> turn<00:05:55.050> in<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:55.320> half<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.740> turn<00:05:55.950> turn<00:05:56.310> out<00:05:56.460> a

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
you turn in a half a turn turn out a

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.730 
you turn in a half a turn turn out a
half<00:05:56.760> a<00:05:56.880> turn<00:05:57.060> nothing<00:05:57.479> changes<00:05:58.050> it's<00:05:58.500> not

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
half a turn nothing changes it's not

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.379 
half a turn nothing changes it's not
your<00:05:58.919> idle<00:05:59.220> mixture<00:05:59.400> it's<00:05:59.820> something<00:06:00.210> else

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
your idle mixture it's something else

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.930 
your idle mixture it's something else
okay<00:06:01.200> of<00:06:01.620> course<00:06:01.680> there's<00:06:02.010> always<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.370> vacuum

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
okay of course there's always the vacuum

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.700 
okay of course there's always the vacuum
leak<00:06:03.150> problem<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:03.900> would<00:06:04.050> be<00:06:04.200> the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
leak problem and that would be the

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.800 
leak problem and that would be the
gasket<00:06:05.250> here<00:06:05.550> is<00:06:05.669> about<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:05.970> only<00:06:06.180> place<00:06:06.330> on

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
gasket here is about the only place on

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.680 
gasket here is about the only place on
this<00:06:07.020> one<00:06:07.260> so<00:06:07.500> so<00:06:08.070> check<00:06:08.340> those<00:06:08.550> things<00:06:08.940> that

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
this one so so check those things that

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.080
