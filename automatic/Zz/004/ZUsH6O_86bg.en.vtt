00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
believe is like the download information

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.620 
believe is like the download information
for<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.760> Vita<00:02:55.609> where<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:56.640> think<00:02:57.000> it's<00:02:57.420> just

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
for the Vita where I think it's just

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.420 
for the Vita where I think it's just
that<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.290> these<00:02:58.410> games<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:59.010> pre-loaded

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that all of these games are pre-loaded

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.240 
that all of these games are pre-loaded
onto<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.239> memory<00:03:00.600> card<00:03:00.870> which<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.470> pretty

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
onto the memory card which is pretty

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.120 
onto the memory card which is pretty
nice<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:04.859> have

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
nice and then we have just have

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.039 
nice and then we have just have
promotion<00:03:06.000> stuff<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.950> screen<00:03:08.549> protector
