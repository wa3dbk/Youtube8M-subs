00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
press number 43 every time I make a half

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.020 
press number 43 every time I make a half
wood<00:00:10.050> press<00:00:10.350> I<00:00:10.559> tested<00:00:11.099> before<00:00:11.430> I<00:00:11.460> send<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.880> out

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
wood press I tested before I send it out

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.110 
wood press I tested before I send it out
this<00:00:12.900> press<00:00:13.230> goes<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.890> an<00:00:14.040> artist<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.580> Georgia

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
this press goes to an artist in Georgia

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.019 
this press goes to an artist in Georgia
he<00:00:15.330> sent<00:00:15.630> me<00:00:15.810> a<00:00:16.350> sample<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.100> his<00:00:17.250> drawing<00:00:17.640> which

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
he sent me a sample of his drawing which

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.510 
he sent me a sample of his drawing which
I<00:00:18.210> transferred<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.200> copper<00:00:19.680> plate<00:00:19.950> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
I transferred to this copper plate to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.029 
I transferred to this copper plate to
make<00:00:20.670> his<00:00:20.880> test<00:00:21.210> plate<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.830> put<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
make his test plate I'm going to put a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.580 
make his test plate I'm going to put a
few<00:00:23.340> finishing<00:00:24.030> touches<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.289> dry

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
few finishing touches on it with dry

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.220 
few finishing touches on it with dry
point<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.190> a<00:00:26.880> few<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.300> additions<00:00:28.020> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
point and a few little additions and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.480 
point and a few little additions and
then<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:28.860> print<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
then I'm going to print it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.900 
then I'm going to print it
I<00:00:29.869> start<00:00:30.869> my<00:00:31.020> dry<00:00:31.260> point<00:00:31.560> by<00:00:32.189> making<00:00:32.640> some

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
I start my dry point by making some

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
I start my dry point by making some
little<00:00:33.059> scratches<00:00:33.930> now<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:34.710> seen<00:00:35.039> what<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
little scratches now I've seen what it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.150 
little scratches now I've seen what it
looks<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.910> from<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.270> proof<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> made

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
looks like from a proof that I made

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
looks like from a proof that I made
earlier<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> first<00:00:39.510> trial<00:00:40.050> proof

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
earlier this is the first trial proof

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
earlier this is the first trial proof
and<00:00:41.059> I<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.840> awfully<00:00:43.460> it's<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and I can see that it's awfully it's the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
and I can see that it's awfully it's the
same<00:00:45.030> there's<00:00:45.360> too<00:00:45.540> much<00:00:45.720> monotone<00:00:46.380> here<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
same there's too much monotone here so I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
same there's too much monotone here so I
want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.309> back<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> darken<00:00:48.149> some<00:00:48.180> areas

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
want to go back and darken some areas

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
want to go back and darken some areas
and<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.320> I'll<00:00:49.440> print<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> test<00:00:50.340> proof

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and then I'll print it as a test proof

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
and then I'll print it as a test proof
while<00:00:51.630> I<00:00:51.660> work<00:00:52.050> I'll<00:00:52.410> rub<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> little<00:00:53.070> black<00:00:53.280> ink

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
while I work I'll rub a little black ink

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.990 
while I work I'll rub a little black ink
into<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.450> see<00:00:54.660> how<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:55.020> progress<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.739> going

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
into it to see how my progress is going

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
into it to see how my progress is going
just<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.750> bit<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.489> black

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
just take a little bit of this black

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.569 
just take a little bit of this black
itching<00:01:00.030> ink<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.890> rub<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.399> with

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
itching ink out and just rub it in with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.130 
itching ink out and just rub it in with
my<00:01:02.789> finger<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.949> then<00:01:04.949> I'll<00:01:05.070> wipe<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.610> with

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
my finger and then I'll wipe it off with

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
my finger and then I'll wipe it off with
some<00:01:07.140> collagen<00:01:10.520> just<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.000> were<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
some collagen just as if I were going to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
some collagen just as if I were going to
print<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> Bart<00:01:14.580> darken<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
print it if I want to Bart darken the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.930 
print it if I want to Bart darken the
area<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> hair<00:01:17.010> lines<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
area it here where the hair lines are I

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.600 
area it here where the hair lines are I
just<00:01:18.390> scratch<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.320> dry<00:01:19.560> point<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just scratch it with dry point now this

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.440 
just scratch it with dry point now this
the<00:01:21.479> over<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.560> began<00:01:23.040> by<00:01:23.430> transferring<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the over the I began by transferring a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.550 
the over the I began by transferring a
laser<00:01:24.720> print<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> artists<00:01:26.640> original

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
laser print from the artists original

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
laser print from the artists original
onto<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> copper<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.520> edged<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.090> with

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
onto the copper and then I edged it with

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
onto the copper and then I edged it with
ferric<00:01:30.720> chloride<00:01:30.770> just<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> started

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
ferric chloride just to get it started

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
ferric chloride just to get it started
so<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> image<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> put<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
so I can see the image and then I put a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.850 
so I can see the image and then I put a
hard<00:01:35.100> ground<00:01:35.340> over<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.299> went<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
hard ground over that and went in and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
hard ground over that and went in and
etch<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.759> lines<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
etch some more lines in so it's a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
etch some more lines in so it's a
constant<00:01:41.130> process<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.909> adding<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.630> changing

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
constant process of adding and changing

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.670 
constant process of adding and changing
as<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.810> perhaps<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.350> already

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
as I go so perhaps you can see already

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.560 
as I go so perhaps you can see already
that<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.549> area<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> darker<00:01:50.329> this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that that area is darker this is a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
that that area is darker this is a
printing<00:01:52.110> demonstration<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> plate

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
printing demonstration not a plate

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
printing demonstration not a plate
making<00:01:54.000> demonstration<00:01:54.900> but<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> give

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
making demonstration but I want to give

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.289 
making demonstration but I want to give
you<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.950> idea<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.850> how<00:01:57.150> I<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.329> started<00:01:59.299> okay

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you an idea as to how I got started okay

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.399 
you an idea as to how I got started okay
I've<00:02:00.390> been<00:02:00.450> working<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.200> quite<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
I've been working on it for quite a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
I've been working on it for quite a
while<00:02:01.649> now<00:02:02.630> scrapers<00:02:03.630> furnitures<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.850> will

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
while now scrapers furnitures you will

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.990 
while now scrapers furnitures you will
let<00:02:06.390> work

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
let work

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
owner in Georgia what I do first is

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.050 
owner in Georgia what I do first is
lowered<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.320> top<00:04:00.950> roller<00:04:01.280> down<00:04:01.490> all<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.940> way

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.310 
lowered the top roller down all the way
and<00:04:02.770> then<00:04:03.770> back<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.370> roller<00:04:04.580> off<00:04:04.790> again

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
and then back the roller off again

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.690 
and then back the roller off again
counting<00:04:06.320> backwards<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.040> keeping<00:04:07.550> the

counting backwards and keeping the

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.950 
counting backwards and keeping the
roller<00:04:08.080> even

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.340 

these<00:04:14.560> are<00:04:15.690> 8:10<00:04:16.690> half-turns<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:20.290> an

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
these are 8:10 half-turns it's an

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.140 
these are 8:10 half-turns it's an
estimate<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.360> not<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:24.640> doesn't<00:04:24.940> have<00:04:25.030> to

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
estimate this is not it doesn't have to

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.290 
estimate this is not it doesn't have to
be<00:04:25.240> terribly<00:04:26.020> precise<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:27.730> point<00:04:28.000> is<00:04:28.150> you

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
be terribly precise the point is you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.500 
be terribly precise the point is you
need<00:04:28.450> to<00:04:28.570> raise<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.990> rollers<00:04:29.290> high<00:04:29.560> enough<00:04:30.510> to

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
need to raise the rollers high enough to

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.560 
need to raise the rollers high enough to
start<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:32.020> press<00:04:33.180> rollers<00:04:34.180> over<00:04:34.480> the

start the press rollers over the
blankets<00:04:35.020> like<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:36.090> then<00:04:37.090> tighten<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.140> back

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
blankets like that then tighten it back

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.930 
blankets like that then tighten it back
down<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:41.080> always<00:04:41.320> debatable<00:04:41.950> how<00:04:42.640> tight

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
down it's always debatable how tight

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.260 
down it's always debatable how tight
should<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.360> make<00:04:43.540> it<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:44.700> just<00:04:45.700> like<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.150> make

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
should you make it I just like to make

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.040 
should you make it I just like to make
it<00:04:46.450> as<00:04:47.320> tight<00:04:47.650> as<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.920> feels<00:04:48.730> right<00:04:48.940> this<00:04:49.750> comes

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
it as tight as it feels right this comes

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.030 
it as tight as it feels right this comes

whole<00:05:19.570> point<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.260> has<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:20.770> be<00:05:20.860> soft<00:05:22.560> paper

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
whole point is that has to be soft paper

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.530 
whole point is that has to be soft paper
always<00:05:23.830> has<00:05:24.070> two<00:05:24.280> sides<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.880> like<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.180> print<00:05:25.360> on

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
always has two sides I like to print on

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.610 
always has two sides I like to print on
the<00:05:25.630> side<00:05:25.840> it's<00:05:26.140> a<00:05:26.320> little<00:05:26.860> rough<00:05:27.250> looking

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
the side it's a little rough looking

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.030 
the side it's a little rough looking
looks<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.740> little<00:05:29.830> more<00:05:30.010> natural<00:05:31.830> it'll<00:05:32.830> fit<00:05:32.950> in

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
looks a little more natural it'll fit in

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.070 
looks a little more natural it'll fit in
there<00:05:33.190> just<00:05:33.340> like<00:05:33.550> that

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.890 

warm<00:05:37.009> the<00:05:37.190> plate<00:05:38.560> oil-based<00:05:39.560> ink<00:05:40.900> works

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
warm the plate oil-based ink works

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.710 
warm the plate oil-based ink works
better<00:05:42.229> if<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.099> plate<00:05:43.310> is<00:05:43.550> warmed<00:05:44.030> slightly

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
better if the plate is warmed slightly

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.339 
better if the plate is warmed slightly
not<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:45.860> hot<00:05:46.099> that<00:05:46.940> it<00:05:47.120> bakes<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.810> ink<00:05:47.990> into

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
not so hot that it bakes the ink into

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.360 
not so hot that it bakes the ink into
the<00:05:48.440> plate<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:48.919> wouldn't<00:05:49.190> want<00:05:49.340> that<00:05:51.370> hot

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
the plate you wouldn't want that hot

00:05:52.370 --> 00:06:11.439 
the plate you wouldn't want that hot
enough<00:05:53.020> that<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.229> ink<00:05:54.409> is<00:05:54.590> warm<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.099> soft

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.510 

you<00:06:12.050> can<00:06:12.229> feel<00:06:12.469> the<00:06:12.650> resistance<00:06:13.009> when<00:06:13.400> you

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
you can feel the resistance when you

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.969 
you can feel the resistance when you
first<00:06:13.729> start<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.360> then<00:06:14.469> when<00:06:15.469> it<00:06:15.590> comes<00:06:15.740> to

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
first start and then when it comes to

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.379 
first start and then when it comes to
the<00:06:16.069> plate<00:06:16.309> you<00:06:16.340> could<00:06:16.610> really<00:06:16.939> feel<00:06:17.090> is<00:06:17.360> a

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
the plate you could really feel is a

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:18.850 
the plate you could really feel is a
little<00:06:17.629> soft<00:06:18.020> to<00:06:18.229> me<00:06:18.349> so<00:06:18.559> I'm<00:06:18.650> going<00:06:18.800> to

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
little soft to me so I'm going to

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.010 
little soft to me so I'm going to
tighten<00:06:19.669> it<00:06:19.699> up<00:06:19.849> another<00:06:20.210> quarter<00:06:20.960> of<00:06:21.080> a<00:06:21.169> turn

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
tighten it up another quarter of a turn

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.660 
tighten it up another quarter of a turn
that<00:06:24.020> feels<00:06:24.349> a<00:06:24.469> little<00:06:24.559> bit<00:06:24.770> better

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.280 

I<00:06:29.110> like<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.260> print<00:06:30.440> slowly<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:32.690> seems<00:06:32.990> to<00:06:33.140> me

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
I like to print slowly it seems to me

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.890 
I like to print slowly it seems to me
that<00:06:33.320> the<00:06:33.620> longer<00:06:33.830> you<00:06:34.720> exert<00:06:35.720> the<00:06:35.870> pressure

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
that the longer you exert the pressure

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.930 
that the longer you exert the pressure
than<00:06:36.470> the<00:06:36.500> better<00:06:36.830> the<00:06:37.040> transfer<00:06:37.520> is<00:06:37.580> going<00:06:37.670> to

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
than the better the transfer is going to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.960 
than the better the transfer is going to
be<00:06:41.620> now<00:06:42.620> because<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:43.160> video<00:06:43.460> is<00:06:43.580> from<00:06:43.760> that

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
be now because the video is from that

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.870 
be now because the video is from that
side<00:06:44.300> and<00:06:44.770> it's<00:06:45.770> kind<00:06:45.980> of<00:06:46.070> dramatic<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.700> pull

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
side and it's kind of dramatic to pull

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.010 
side and it's kind of dramatic to pull
the<00:06:46.970> proof<00:06:47.180> I'm<00:06:47.360> going<00:06:47.570> to<00:06:47.630> run<00:06:47.750> it<00:06:47.870> back

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
the proof I'm going to run it back

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.080 
the proof I'm going to run it back
through<00:06:48.190> you'll<00:06:49.190> also<00:06:49.400> get<00:06:49.730> a<00:06:49.790> better

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
through you'll also get a better

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.710 
through you'll also get a better
impression<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:51.470> only<00:06:51.710> drawback<00:06:52.160> is<00:06:52.190> that<00:06:52.720> the

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
impression the only drawback is that the

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.700 
impression the only drawback is that the
plate<00:06:54.260> being<00:06:55.100> partly<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:55.700> dry<00:06:56.030> point<00:06:56.410> will<00:06:57.410> wear

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
plate being partly a dry point will wear

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.200 
plate being partly a dry point will wear
out<00:06:57.980> the<00:06:58.250> more<00:06:58.430> times<00:06:58.700> you<00:06:58.880> run<00:06:59.030> it<00:06:59.150> through

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
out the more times you run it through

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.160 
out the more times you run it through
the<00:06:59.450> press<00:07:00.580> but<00:07:01.580> for<00:07:01.790> this<00:07:01.910> test<00:07:02.240> this<00:07:02.810> video

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
the press but for this test this video

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.060 
the press but for this test this video
I'll<00:07:04.130> bring<00:07:04.460> it<00:07:04.610> back<00:07:04.760> out<00:07:04.970> so<00:07:05.330> that<00:07:05.830> you<00:07:06.830> as<00:07:07.040> a

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
I'll bring it back out so that you as a

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.420 
I'll bring it back out so that you as a
viewer<00:07:07.550> can<00:07:08.540> see<00:07:08.780> how<00:07:08.930> it<00:07:09.080> looks<00:07:09.290> one<00:07:10.220> more

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
viewer can see how it looks one more

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.270 
viewer can see how it looks one more
thing<00:07:10.700> I<00:07:10.850> do<00:07:10.910> before<00:07:11.060> I<00:07:11.480> pull<00:07:11.810> the<00:07:11.930> proof<00:07:15.130> is<00:07:16.130> I

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
thing I do before I pull the proof is I

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.510 
thing I do before I pull the proof is I
put<00:07:16.520> what<00:07:16.670> I<00:07:16.700> call<00:07:17.030> a<00:07:17.240> moment<00:07:17.690> number<00:07:18.370> it's<00:07:19.370> a

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 
put what I call a moment number it's a

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.680 
put what I call a moment number it's a
little<00:07:19.730> kind<00:07:19.910> of<00:07:20.060> secret<00:07:20.480> code<00:07:20.720> of<00:07:20.960> mine

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
little kind of secret code of mine

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.640 
little kind of secret code of mine
giving<00:07:23.690> the<00:07:23.810> date<00:07:24.730> 2009<00:07:25.990> month<00:07:26.990> of<00:07:27.170> February

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
giving the date 2009 month of February

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.840 
giving the date 2009 month of February
the<00:07:28.240> 23rd<00:07:29.240> day<00:07:29.570> and<00:07:30.440> it<00:07:31.340> is<00:07:31.550> right<00:07:31.970> now<00:07:32.150> about

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
the 23rd day and it is right now about

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:53.940 
the 23rd day and it is right now about
7:30<00:07:34.870> that<00:07:35.870> being<00:07:38.050> 1930

00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:00.260 

so<00:07:54.550> that<00:07:54.760> concludes<00:07:55.300> the<00:07:55.960> test<00:07:57.180> for<00:07:58.180> number<00:07:58.450> 43

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.270 
so that concludes the test for number 43
