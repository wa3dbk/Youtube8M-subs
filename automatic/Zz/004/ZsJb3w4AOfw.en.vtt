00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.400
 Well coming 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.049
 we 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.950
 The program that I spent with my childhood puberty 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.869
 I also dreamed that I was going to think again 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.940
 I want to say that I am glorious. 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.379
 I'm happy now , I thought it was the same folder yesterday, not two days . 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.879
 Uh 1st 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:41.179
 Another addition to all the staffs indeed happy times as well as low'm shooting 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.979
 I thought that going to a performer who made good 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:50.449
 If the former's glory cheonsaengyeonbun a little greedy, I look again at this 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:54.649
 Suggestions by audience with good people who have old people 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.639
 Some memories of the past, some of my young friends this program again 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.429
 It is easy to show you another entertaining performance called birth 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:05.510
 I hope many of you will support me. 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:09.439
 Artists and kids also have a lot of exponential growth in groups 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.619
 It seems that there was not space to appear as it is. 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.060
 I also think that I can tell you a new Earl 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.109
 Hold it. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.200
 And after that, I told you more . 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:26.539
 I told him I was going to do it again . 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.850
 So do not tell me he gave to lose energy at that time that Asians 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.600
 You were on your own program. 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.869
 When the year is over, there's almost no voice . 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.020
 I told you it was so hard that I could not hear it. 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.729
 Do not be tired on the way to the bath, 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 And those who owe will show the cast of the camera bishop who step 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:53.359
 You told me you wanted to go through the energy process from the beginning . 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.259
 So far my energy is going to follow my dark brother, 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:02:00.399
 So I look at it is this program in the 1st low-energy gauge is slightly 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.399
 I do not think I will. 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 U 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.450
