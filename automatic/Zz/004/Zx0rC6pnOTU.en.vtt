00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.260
 today transport is gregging its 70 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:26.289
 employees it's 35 engine and it's pretty much 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.789
 close to 90 gray cards for a figure 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.250
 business of just over 6 million 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.050
 three hundred thousand euros fashion in the year 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 2008 so growth enough 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.269
 interesting 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.999
 we have known we have not known 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.050
 decreasing at all in 17 years 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.579
 I hope that it will not be 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.859
 first year this year and we will do 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.059
 all for it to continue now the 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.589
 crisis it's here for everyone 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.399
 there is a way of the comba that I 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:54.339
 do not want I want to avoid the suffer I want 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.179
 confront him and today of crisis I 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.179
 speak rather of recovery 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.240
 first of all were the first surprised 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.350
 firstly because it does not make me 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.260
 a folder that is not the subject 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.820
 of an application and I think the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.170
 purposes I am convinced that the points 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.090
 that have been withheld for us are 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.410
 essentially linked on four points 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.150
 the first one actually is our 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.650
 double floor material but the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.110
 double board material exists since 18 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.820
 however, we rarely have a bachelor's degree 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.790
 kindergarten it was rather interminable 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.060
 so it's also the 18 year old reward 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.650
 of work the second point is a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.030
 intervention that I had the year 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.670
 last with the people of the cram so 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.870
 regional health insurance fund 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.310
 since our approach has been to say to 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.040
 our customers rather than mounting your 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.720
 pallets at 1 meter 80 or to demote 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.920
 your pallets to 1 m 40 and we are you 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.280
 will double them in the calm 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
 and sas has improved the hardness of the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.490
 work essentially in the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.470
 logistics warehouses and in the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.700
 hypermarkets or shopping centers 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 distribution since the people who 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.180
 do not shelve 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.010
 packages of 20 kg to 2 meters but 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.580
 rather comics 10 kg to 1 meter 50 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.140
 the third point is our aspect 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580
 sharp on embedded computing 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.080
 for over ten years all our 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.480
 vehicles are equipped obviously 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.190
 but gprs and embedded computing 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.720
 which gives us the positioning of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.640
 drivers that gives us the time to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.690
 work etc which also allows the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.340
 drivers to have information 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.840
 in the truck and that allows him 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.580
 also through a button or this 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.650
 that we call anti-aggression of power 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.959
 is positioned in case of difficulty either 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.520
 on his person either on the truck or 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.470
 on the goods and that comes out 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.150
 directly in alarm here at the company 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.790
 and last but not least 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 innovative side instead of doing a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.580
 corporate newspaper i made a cd 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.590
 the business sectors that said 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.440
 that today a driver has more than 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.390
 wrong 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.220
 a newspaper by cons it has a facility 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.390
 copy is for four hours 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.750
 and a half behind a steering wheel to listen to a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.110
 CD 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.670
 so I'm going out 3 cd a year with themes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.380
 very specific or where we go from 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.870
 information of which calm of the CEO 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.550
 I intervene on the few figures 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 on the business the health of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.270
 the business and evolution there is such a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.680
 which can be the point license that 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.990
 can be health and hygiene a 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.540
 work that can be on many others 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.090
 subjects to which, moreover, a committee of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.650
 writing participates here 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.340
 and then we also remember 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.770
 welcome new employees 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:22.310
 emile who came to Lille roger who 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.310
 got on board that was east 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.320
 assimilable today the interior 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.350
 have obviously been filed 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.300
 then the double floor trailer of 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.060
 very basic way today allows 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.160
 to a customer and to transport us well 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.690
 obviously to be able to double the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.700
 loading capacity in a truck 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.489
 this loading capacity in a 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.140
 truck she she is addressing very obvious 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.730
 to a certain type of pump it was spoken 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.910
 just now pallets from 300 to 500 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.540
 kg which germain it had to be 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.489
 very easy to use 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.810
 today the safety standards the 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.420
 load protocols 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.950
 draconian I worked on a 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.630
 trailer presents the operation 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 as simple as possible that they can 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.780
 to address any type 2 of warehouses and 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.840
 any kind of loading 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.340
 in fact it is a classic semi form 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.800
 author of that is normal she does 13 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.780
 meters 40 by two because finally wide 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.120
 is sure that inside there is a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.480
 hydraulic floor that I call a 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.210
 defender this hydraulic floor is 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.340
 laid in the art edge refill in 30 years 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.860
 but 10 tons when ended a 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.990
 driver actuates his remote control the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.850
 floor show crates our 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.980
 roofing like a box system to 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.510
 pie chart and allows positioning to 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.460
 we at 33 pallets on the floor of the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.100
 that makes it over we go down 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 snapped back down three and we have 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.820
 we actually 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.430
 positioned inside a truck 66 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.250
 European- style palace had said barrels 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.770
 and 14 hours room need to 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.640
 work on a simple technology 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.400
 of use 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.950
 we have resumed almost with the case received 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.090
 the technology of details and thing 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.740
 we know Brittany well since 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.150
 today the livestock transport 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.470
 animals on two levels or even 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.460
 out of three lives today we see 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.350
 three-level nightmares 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.420
 so in fact I thought to myself if we are 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.740
 able to ride pigs on two 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.360
 floors we should still be good 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.890
 able to mount pallets on our 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.230
 sector what is happening today 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.360
 with us 46 Norman double floor 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.540
 at home I read today that shines on 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.160
 France and Europe and the three 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.740
 important points that needed to be 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.090
 answer is the economy while you 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.950
 hand a customer sir when you 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.810
 even go loading in a single 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.240
 gift so I have it will not cost you 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.730
 patrick decaix far the second point 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.110
 this is the qualitative side stop from 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.850
 to raise your pallets too high 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.100
 your products will suffer crashing 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.300
 today on the contrary go down and 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.430
 voice is we will double the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.560
 capabilities tp third point that is not 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.320
 least important and that is important before 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.890
 today 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.330
 that's why it's the environment 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.920
 we will have to move to us 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.450
 ask the real questions about the future 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.410
 piggybacking could have been an answer 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.400
 unfortunately today we are 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.170
 still very far 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.260
 so he'll have to have us 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.700
 carriers we accept the 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.990
 finding and proposing 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.670
 solutions that will avoid multiplying 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.870
 and multiply the number of vehicles on 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.910
 the road to transport products 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.650
 which sometimes do not fulfill the 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.650
 capacity neither in volume nor in com
