00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.490 
videos I'm guessing flash drives with
you<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.269> same<00:04:01.449> music<00:04:01.840> pictures<00:04:02.169> videos

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.490 
you know the same music pictures videos
and<00:04:02.859> here<00:04:03.549> you<00:04:03.609> can<00:04:03.730> see<00:04:03.849> your<00:04:03.970> land<00:04:04.500> input

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and here you can see your land input

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.420 
and here you can see your land input
that's<00:04:06.010> where<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.340> would<00:04:06.459> hook<00:04:06.579> up<00:04:06.730> here

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
that's where you would hook up here

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.530 
that's where you would hook up here
you<00:04:08.609> know<00:04:08.730> your<00:04:09.569> Ethernet<00:04:10.079> cable<00:04:10.109> there<00:04:11.540> and

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
you know your Ethernet cable there and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.809 
you know your Ethernet cable there and
plug<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.019> there<00:04:13.170> either<00:04:13.650> way<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.129> prefer<00:04:14.579> it

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
plug it in there either way I prefer it

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.310 
plug it in there either way I prefer it
that<00:04:14.879> way<00:04:15.150> because<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.629> is<00:04:15.659> much<00:04:15.900> faster<00:04:16.109> than

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
that way because it is much faster than

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.430 
that way because it is much faster than
Wi-Fi<00:04:16.650> Wi-Fi<00:04:17.070> there's<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.519> lot<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.880> lag<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.410> I

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi there's a lot of lag so I

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.170 
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi there's a lot of lag so I
would<00:04:19.799> prefer<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.220> way<00:04:20.370> especially<00:04:20.609> for

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
would prefer it that way especially for

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.909 
would prefer it that way especially for
streaming<00:04:21.449> over<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.840> Internet<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.800> have

35:35<00:04:25.199> that's<00:04:25.680> perfect<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.150> know<00:04:27.570> when

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
35:35 that's perfect so you know when

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.270 
35:35 that's perfect so you know when
you<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:27.900> multiple<00:04:28.080> things<00:04:28.710> connected<00:04:29.190> it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
you have multiple things connected it

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.820 
you have multiple things connected it
