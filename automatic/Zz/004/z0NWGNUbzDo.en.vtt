00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.230
 in a new video of a bukit tutorial 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.450
 today we are going to teach how to do 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.210
 Let your friends enter a server with the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 program only hamachi the fence so 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 in the program for now also it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.019
 can do if hamas and but for now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.189
 we will teach with hamas if it is going to 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.779
 have to ask your friends to be 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.369
 install on the go quite easy I 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.679
 I leave the link in the description what 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.839
 download install it and go to the 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.669
 hamchi I do not want to do here to cut the 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.769
 video to install it course was going to 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.570
 do as 12 minutes as the first 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.570
 video that lasted like 12 minutes less 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.030
 they are going to ask for a username 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 they put any in this case service to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 eternal because the record has long 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.159
 computer and good is going to come out as 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 so disconnected will connect you here 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.549
 checking and ready they will be 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.549
 connected and now we're going to go to 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.899
 Now what we have to do is go create 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.600
 a new network we put the name of the 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:12.710
 network we give an example a wiki 2014 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 2014 and the password will be 1 2 3 a 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.530
 example 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 create has already been created here up to five 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.570
 players are going to be able to put in if 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.220
 they want to get more players create 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 another network and it happens in the same network 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.860
 good network to your friend an example 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 now we go to the server 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:46.100
 here we have the server and ok now we 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.100
 let's see how to be repeated 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.149
 good as has been shown in the first 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 video here are the configurations by 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.740
 Now we are going to give you left click on 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.560
 any side of here if we click on it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.829
 left and again the left in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.049
 copy ipv4 address now where it says 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.670
 be flu in the settings you 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.760
 we give to paste ready let's save 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.090
 ready now pause 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 if we have windows 7 we put here fire 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 same and now equal windows and we leave 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.140
 here 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.130
 and we go where to go activate or 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.950
 disable windows firewall if I think 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.709
 that in windows 7 is always like that you 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.290
 it's going to look like this, they're not going to have 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.209
 what to turn off will give each warning 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.790
 that is wrong that we tactile or the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.510
 such firewall I am strong but it does not matter 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.670
 the seventh knots and accept ready that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.890
 is now now can enter only 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.770
 pass the password and the idea is to your 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.080
 friends and ready - well we started the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.170
 server 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 cicadas me while I'm opening the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.370
 minecraft to the elite that you have to 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.370
 pass on to your friends what I told them 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.170
 that they put in the brain and models 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.770
 that's how he's learning zero 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.840
 I do not know why it takes me so long 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.330
 and was acquired 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.080
 h 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.980
 I do not think I 'm marking up 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.980
 to this nor p that would be good we're going to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.980
 multiplayer 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.750
 good here instead of putting localhost go 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.269
 to put on flu two hours and I want to say 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.020
 already opened saurios ready let's go now 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.700
 below and as you will see 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.880
 open ready more server 0 of 8 good 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.640
 no more in the pressure I was subscribe 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.190
 city ​​and like good the next video 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.080
 I'm thinking about doing plugins and then 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.390
 I see when I'm going to do that card 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.610
 what is the card is a program that makes 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.590
 so that I do not use the hamchi is an ip 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.320
 dedicated to get the numbers, it is 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.940
 an example you can have or class point 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.220
 no ip point dot org for example not going 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.600
 to be neither weighs what happens is that hamas and 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.700
 It's very good because you do not feel like it 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.120
 but there's no p what he's going to do is give you 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.910
 the low even though I have five dedicated 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.640
 from ram 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.970
 the server is going to walk you 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.940
 as if you had 3 ram's if it's what 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.430
 bad but good we 're not going to any 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.430
