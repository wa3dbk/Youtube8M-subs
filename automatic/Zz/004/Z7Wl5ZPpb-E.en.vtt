 this often happens afterwards 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 until the stakes with the smoke became a fact we should 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.830
 show some numbers 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.550

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.679
 to finally prove her to know 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.289
 our intentions proposed 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.279
 our entire trial has been tested 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.429
 film crew to the surprise of the Canadian 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.429
 artists knew no bounds 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.919
 but 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.169
 the influence of the capital of circus fashion this 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.930
 status of eastern province of canada 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.549
 received 15 years ago thanks to the promotion 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.579
 against his 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.599
 today is the most successful circus 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.279
 enterprises in the world 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.239
 great rank great compatriot on 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:15.799
 one year 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.229
 and 10 times smaller span and could not 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.229
 he has other interests 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.739
 m of course we are doomed compared to individuals 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.919
 since we are near 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.419
 at first the audience is very often 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.650
 likely the further the more 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.689
 it became clear that the performance with us 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.819
 totally different 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.579
 times we are unlike others most 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.709
 most consider ourselves big already been on 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.739
 touring twenty four countries 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.290
 so here and most just 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.749
 luring his programs 7 million 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.360
 if doing performances 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.550
 we first thought up to be staged 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.149
 then arrange casting 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.909
 that's what makes it more fun 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.859
 a separate story this industry boundaries they 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.029
 create a show that is more than 15 20 years 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.589
 in the process of rolling, they are already creating a club 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.069
 the site 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.210
 among the goals we also visited 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.690
 complex huge building on the outskirts 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.190
 montreal is like anything up to 11 story 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.710
 this circulation is the sea of ​​the ten hull chapter 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.870
 the region from our travelers 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.230
 save and factories and circus 90 buildings 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.500
 the next program will return to the rich 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.370
 according to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.209
 here everything is much more modest 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.840
 railway station friends 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.800
 named after the former general 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 governor of canada that is in the very 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.169
 center of montreal is where the color is 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.719

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:40.520

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.360
 then circus art 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.710
 evolved like a Canadian brand like 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.680

 Kalashnikov was not for us 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:59.439
 I had to change anything 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.809
 yet it was adapted for 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:01.539
 work 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.740

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.529
 tons of gold 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:17.769
 or we have two bills 

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.129
 which we call tent appearances in 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.960
 network 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.180
 here we are not creating our sun 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.259
 in the same room we hold 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.259

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.740
 acrobatic muscles bel belivo and feelings 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.810

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.360
 You are not here, but red noses are used here. 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.509
 only as a souvenir for guests 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.159
 I was impressed by the locals from day one 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.990
 their courage 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.880
 they decided to create a new circus where 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.580
 For a long time, the monopolist was plus 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.180
 Alley people should be the only choice 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.240
 Cyc will develop further 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.169
 tires that wording 180 third 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.789
 and not at all to work in 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.949
 the circus then he just left 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.330
 socialist poland 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.629
 Of course I wanted to work with this topic. 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.710

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.449
 scale circus school tactics in 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.330
 Monreale in France or Moscow 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.270
 time of course it's easier to work they 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.949
 come prepared but 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.729
 yet I know one brilliant 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:56.520
 an African artist who has learned 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.490
 everything that he can on the beaches 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.580
 when the tube appeared 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.620
 a professional like gestures 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.870
 sana with a clear conscience left 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.499
 the scene 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:07.859
 business dictated its rules of the game pa 

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.359
 then you start working on it 

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:10.319
 project and he becomes 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.909
 scale need to do 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.109
 consumer choice in this artist or you 

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:15.489
