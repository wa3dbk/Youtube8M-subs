so<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.140> made<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:56.329> breakout<00:00:57.329> board

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.539 

that's<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> chip<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> bottom<00:01:04.549> I've

heatsink that there's our thermal pad on
the<00:01:07.320> back<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.340> heatsink<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> out

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the back of it so I have heatsink to out

I've<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> scope<00:01:22.439> measuring<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
I've got a scope measuring the the

think<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.229> maybe<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.500> zip<00:01:34.740> drive<00:01:35.009> motor

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

well I did tape it down this tape is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.020 
well I did tape it down this tape is
done<00:03:04.080> because<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.590> tends<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.220> run<00:03:05.519> away<00:03:05.819> with

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
done because it tends to run away with

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.920 
done because it tends to run away with
the<00:03:06.120> Sun<00:03:07.670> they<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.120> context<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.750> motor

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the Sun they the context of the motor

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.839 
the Sun they the context of the motor
were<00:03:10.230> through<00:03:10.470> some<00:03:10.650> little<00:03:10.860> sprung<00:03:11.160> pens<00:03:11.489> on

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
were through some little sprung pens on

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.030 
were through some little sprung pens on
the<00:03:11.970> back<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.540> back<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.379> motor<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.980> I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
the back of the back of the motor so I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.150 
the back of the back of the motor so I
just<00:03:14.519> made<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> little<00:03:14.790> bit<00:03:15.660> circuit<00:03:15.989> board<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
just made a little bit circuit board to

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.089 
just made a little bit circuit board to
contact<00:03:17.610> it

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:31.610 

so<00:03:23.099> that<00:03:23.579> goes<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.269> there<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.959> here<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.500> go

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
so that goes on there and here we go

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:41.930 
so that goes on there and here we go
okay<00:03:39.349> with<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.250> resistor<00:03:41.760> have

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
okay with the this resistor have

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.280 
okay with the this resistor have
actually<00:03:42.269> limited<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.720> current<00:03:43.049> lick<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
actually limited the current lick and

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.539 
actually limited the current lick and
flew<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.090> for<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.239> larger<00:03:45.629> motor<00:03:46.549> that's

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
flew and for this larger motor that's

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.069 
flew and for this larger motor that's
not<00:03:47.940> actually<00:03:48.269> enough<00:03:48.420> current<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.870> get<00:03:48.989> it

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
not actually enough current to get it

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.569 
not actually enough current to get it
turning<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.670> I'll<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.150> shorter<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:52.579> current

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
turning so I'll just shorter the current

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:03.410 
turning so I'll just shorter the current
sense<00:03:53.760> resistor<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.930> start<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.440> with

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:12.040 

there<00:04:04.420> we<00:04:04.510> go

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.740 

and<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:12.890> spends<00:04:13.130> up<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.340> about<00:04:13.730> five<00:04:14.420> or<00:04:14.600> six

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
and this spends up to about five or six

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:26.730 
and this spends up to about five or six
thousand<00:04:15.140> rpm

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.660 

runs<00:04:27.740> very<00:04:28.070> smoothly<00:04:30.400> quite<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.430> bit<00:04:31.580> of

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
runs very smoothly quite a bit of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:41.490 
runs very smoothly quite a bit of
gyroscopic<00:04:32.570> effect<00:04:32.900> from<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.580> rotating<00:04:34.580> mass

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.970 

okay

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
okay

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:53.710 
okay
you

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.320 

we<00:04:54.720> go<00:04:54.840> back<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:56.240> zip<00:04:57.240> drive<00:04:57.270> water<00:04:59.330> it

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
we go back to the zip drive water it

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.130 
we go back to the zip drive water it
actually<00:05:00.510> does<00:05:01.260> something<00:05:01.440> rather<00:05:01.800> funny

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
actually does something rather funny

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.230 
actually does something rather funny
finding<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.260> connected<00:05:05.000> trying<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.090> do<00:05:06.180> this

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
finding that connected trying to do this

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.940 
finding that connected trying to do this
with<00:05:06.510> one<00:05:06.660> hand<00:05:06.710> yeah

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
with one hand yeah

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.980 
with one hand yeah
we<00:05:08.850> spin<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.270> up<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.740> then<00:05:14.660> reason<00:05:15.660> one<00:05:15.840> edge

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
we spin that up and then reason one edge

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:41.730 
we spin that up and then reason one edge
drop<00:05:16.470> it

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.960 

it's<00:05:42.740> a<00:05:42.830> bit<00:05:42.950> like<00:05:43.100> a<00:05:43.130> gyroscope<00:05:43.670> try<00:05:43.910> to

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
it's a bit like a gyroscope try to

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.890 
it's a bit like a gyroscope try to
balance<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.510> one<00:05:44.690> edge<00:05:46.330> okay<00:05:47.360> hope<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:47.780> was

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
balance on one edge okay hope that was

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.210 
balance on one edge okay hope that was
interesting

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
interesting

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.580 
interesting
it<00:05:49.580> just<00:05:49.820> shows<00:05:50.150> it's<00:05:50.480> quite<00:05:50.960> easy<00:05:51.110> to<00:05:51.260> drive

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
it just shows it's quite easy to drive

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.560 
it just shows it's quite easy to drive
one<00:05:52.040> of<00:05:52.070> these<00:05:52.280> motors<00:05:52.670> if<00:05:52.880> you've<00:05:53.210> got<00:05:53.360> the

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
one of these motors if you've got the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.190 
one of these motors if you've got the
proper<00:05:54.200> chip<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:55.280> do<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.780> okay<00:05:56.780> thanks<00:05:57.140> for

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
proper chip to do it okay thanks for

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.590 
proper chip to do it okay thanks for
watching
