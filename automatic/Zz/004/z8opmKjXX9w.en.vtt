 say that here are two ways of being and 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 two ways to enjoy this afternoon and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.790
 people that are here approximately 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.530

 young people from the whole region and the second 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.470
 way to enjoy what for me is the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.380
 most important and the best is organizing 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.940
 the implying himself by becoming and being one 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.310
 of those 100 young people who are here 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.350
 rolling the vine and making a background one 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.470
 alternative form of leisure differently and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.750
 healthy, of course 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.040
