00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.510
 also in julienne cheese grated panela 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 acid cream and raw green sauce we put 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.140
 to high heat a saucepan with 3 liters 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.739
 of water 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.980
 we add the chicken breast 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.030
 previously washed the onion the tooth 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.780
 of garlic the sprigs of coriander pepper 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.720
 black ground and a teaspoon and a half 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.750
 of salt remove 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.870
 cover and when it starts to boil 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.130
 we lower the fire in half and leave 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.030
 cook for 40 minutes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 After 40 minutes we turn off and wait 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.810
 let the chicken breast cool 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.100
 of sowing or crumbling the breast 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 of chicken and we reserve we will prepare 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.830
 the tacos for this we need that the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.610
 tortillas are hot from what 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.780
 otherwise they may break or break the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.780
 roll the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.380
 on a flat surface we put the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.440
 hot tortilla add a little bit of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 shredded or shredded chicken and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.180
 we roll in this way 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.900
 I do not like to put a lot of chicken 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.850
 because the taco can be opened or broken 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.850
 We reserve in a container taking care that 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.730
 do not open 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.380
 in a very hot pan add 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.840
 a cup of oil 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.750
 we hope that the oil gets very 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.150
 hot we can check it with a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.150
 piece of tortilla in this way 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.710
 we put the part that is free of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 taco down is directly saying 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.890
 on the pan or the hot oil 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.830
 taking care not to burn us and trying to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.100
 do not open we can help with some 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.180
 kitchen utensil like a shovel 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.390
 wood or a pair of tweezers 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.219
 we fry it periodically 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.970
 until we achieve the desired golden color we extract 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:03.330
 on absorbent paper and we reserve 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.140
 We serve the golden tacos or flutes of 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.540

 grated and accompanied with sour cream and 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.590
 Raw green sauce ready only subtracts 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.010
