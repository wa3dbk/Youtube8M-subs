hi I'm standing down in the port engine
room<00:00:08.340> space<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:09.000> thought<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.870> would<00:00:10.080> take<00:00:10.230> all

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
room space I thought I would take all

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.049 
room space I thought I would take all
the<00:00:10.559> covers<00:00:10.950> off<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.670> could<00:00:11.849> get<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
the covers off so that you could get a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.870 
the covers off so that you could get a
real<00:00:12.420> sort<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.990> under<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.380> skirt<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.160> view<00:00:14.490> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the mechanics of the boat we have sort

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.929 
the mechanics of the boat we have sort
of<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> parallel<00:00:19.439> or<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> mirror<00:00:20.699> image

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
this side of the boat I opened up

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200 
this side of the boat I opened up
because<00:00:25.590> there's<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:26.010> stuff<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.970> talk

because there's more stuff here to talk

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.800 
because there's more stuff here to talk
about<00:00:27.859> now<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> you've<00:00:29.250> seen<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.880> deep<00:00:30.240> the

the sound box cover that sits on that
rubber<00:01:41.970> gasket<00:01:42.710> now<00:01:43.710> we're<00:01:43.890> looking<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.399> on

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

rubber gasket now we're looking down on
the<00:01:44.640> top<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.149> transmission<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:46.290> where

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the top of the transmission that's where

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
the top of the transmission that's where
you<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:46.860> add<00:01:47.180> transmission<00:01:48.180> fluid<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
you would add transmission fluid to the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.560 
you would add transmission fluid to the
unit<00:01:49.649> which<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.920> only<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.909> check<00:01:51.119> very

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

now I've taken the front engine cover

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.340 
now I've taken the front engine cover
off<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.500> this<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.190> really<00:02:00.460> where<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:00.790> do<00:02:01.350> 95%

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
off and this is really where you do 95%

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.680 
off and this is really where you do 95%
of<00:02:02.470> your<00:02:02.590> maintenance<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:04.030> as<00:02:04.180> everything<00:02:04.600> is

on<00:02:59.740> this<00:02:59.920> boat<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.709> switch

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980

filters while you're underway which is
kind<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.320> convenient<00:03:05.739> but<00:03:06.100> it's<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.550> reality

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
kind of convenient but it's in reality

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.680 
kind of convenient but it's in reality
gross<00:03:07.810> overkill<00:03:08.940> most<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> boats<00:03:10.450> will

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
gross overkill most of the boats will

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.290 
gross overkill most of the boats will
have<00:03:10.900> one<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.500> these<00:03:11.650> filters<00:03:12.120> located<00:03:13.120> right

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
have one of these filters located right

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.030 
have one of these filters located right
there<00:03:13.570> on<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> sidewall<00:03:14.380> where<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:14.920> get

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
there on the sidewall where you can get

there on the sidewall where you can get
out<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.340> easily<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.930> think<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.350> pretty

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
out of easily and I think that pretty

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.850 
out of easily and I think that pretty
much<00:03:17.709> covers<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.580> engine<00:03:18.790> room
