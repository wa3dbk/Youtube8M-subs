00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.270 

when<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.140> place<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.560> sweeper<00:01:33.950> into<00:01:34.160> our

elemental machine it becomes the cyclic

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.830 
elemental machine it becomes the cyclic
withering<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:37.759> has<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:37.970> same<00:01:38.300> status<00:01:38.720> as<00:01:38.780> a

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
dozen law to the dead and will be a

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.640 
dozen law to the dead and will be a
one-shot<00:01:41.000> kill<00:01:41.509> into<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> 20s<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.409> start

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
one-shot kill into the 20s and start

00:01:42.650 --> 00:02:15.790 
one-shot kill into the 20s and start
creating<00:01:42.830> crawlers<00:01:43.369> thereafter

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:34.130 

hungry

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.449 

so<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.260> pretty<00:02:35.409> much<00:02:35.530> wraps<00:02:35.799> up<00:02:36.069> this<00:02:36.280> video

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
so that pretty much wraps up this video

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.429 
so that pretty much wraps up this video
I<00:02:36.909> know<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.420> went<00:02:37.569> by<00:02:37.689> pretty<00:02:37.900> quick<00:02:38.230> but

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
I know it went by pretty quick but

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.929 
I know it went by pretty quick but
there's<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.799> much<00:02:38.950> else<00:02:39.159> to<00:02:39.250> show<00:02:39.489> here<00:02:39.790> as

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
there's not much else to show here as

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.610 
there's not much else to show here as

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:46.719 
asking if we will ever release this map

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.809 
asking if we will ever release this map
and<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.019> answer<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.290> yes<00:02:47.379> we<00:02:47.799> will<00:02:47.980> more
