00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.839
 all the snow slush 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.300
 but not such news attracting opal 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.379
 the dynamo of color seems to me very much 

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:23.329

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.329

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.470
 in the light 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.250
 uncomfortable cubic meters of light company and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.020

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.210
 They are good 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.760
 refuel 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.210
 all walk rubber boots 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.760
 from rich to poor they all cherish everything 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.140
 our field so we have to go to 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.450
 rubber boots 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.080
 and all other work pants and strict 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.910

 as you see they are left uncomfortable 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.320
 so it is more important how we smell 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.050
 and that's probably all 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.830
 nothing is so special 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.870
