hello this is be hero fails I am here

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.390 
hello this is be hero fails I am here
today<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> show<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.440> how<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.920> get<00:00:17.340> your

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
today to show you how to get your

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.540 
today to show you how to get your
Minecraft<00:00:18.180> working<00:00:18.779> inside<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.980> Windows<00:00:20.310> 8

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
Minecraft working inside of Windows 8

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.480 
Minecraft working inside of Windows 8
without<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> constant<00:00:21.359> crashes<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> there

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
without the constant crashes so there

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.759 
without the constant crashes so there
are<00:00:23.609> basically<00:00:23.970> three<00:00:24.119> steps<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.170> first<00:00:25.199> two

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
are basically three steps the first two

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.339 
are basically three steps the first two
are<00:00:26.070> rather<00:00:26.580> simple<00:00:27.180> actually<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> them

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
are rather simple actually all of them

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.790 
are rather simple actually all of them
are<00:00:28.470> simple<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
are simple they first two are kind to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.819 
are simple they first two are kind to
common<00:00:31.800> sense<00:00:32.600> for<00:00:33.600> people<00:00:33.630> who<00:00:33.899> know<00:00:34.110> much

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
common sense for people who know much

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.069 
common sense for people who know much
about<00:00:35.010> computers<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.730> general<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.690> first

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
about computers in general the first

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.130 
about computers in general the first
step<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.340> make<00:00:38.790> sure<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.420> Java

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
step is to make sure that you have Java

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
step is to make sure that you have Java
downloaded<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.160> completely<00:00:41.460> up-to-date

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
downloaded and completely up-to-date

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.299 
downloaded and completely up-to-date
inside<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.450> Windows<00:00:42.750> 8<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> are

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
inside of Windows 8 now if you are

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610 
inside of Windows 8 now if you are
running<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> 64-bit<00:00:44.910> operating<00:00:45.600> system<00:00:45.930> my

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
running a 64-bit operating system my

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
running a 64-bit operating system my
recommendation<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> install<00:00:48.090> both<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.050> 32

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
recommendation is to install both the 32

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.779 
recommendation is to install both the 32
bit<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.280> 64-bit<00:00:51.000> versions<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> Java<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
bit and the 64-bit versions of Java the

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.819 
bit and the 64-bit versions of Java the
reason<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.850> suggest<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.559> future

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
reason I suggest this is in the future

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.279 
reason I suggest this is in the future
this<00:00:56.010> allows<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.789> increase<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.780> system

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this allows you to increase your system

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
this allows you to increase your system
memory<00:00:58.640> which<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.670> available<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> minecraft

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
memory which is available to minecraft

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
memory which is available to minecraft
while<00:01:01.379> playing<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.309> useful<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:03.059> use

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
while playing this is useful if you use

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
while playing this is useful if you use
a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> mods<00:01:03.960> such<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.890> Tekkit<00:01:05.339> our

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
a lot of mods such as Tekkit our

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.020 
a lot of mods such as Tekkit our
technicpack<00:01:07.010> this<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> also<00:01:08.430> useful<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
technicpack this is also useful if you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
technicpack this is also useful if you
plan<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.330> using<00:01:09.479> higher<00:01:10.170> resolutions<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
plan on using higher resolutions of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.240 
plan on using higher resolutions of
texture<00:01:11.580> packs<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.030> minecraft<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.740> second

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
texture packs with minecraft the second

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.740 
texture packs with minecraft the second
step<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.420> make<00:01:15.630> sure<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.350> your

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
step is to make sure that you have your

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.890 
step is to make sure that you have your
video<00:01:18.750> card<00:01:19.020> drivers<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.159> date<00:01:20.630> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.810> use
