we're gonna start our thread and lay

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.210 
we're gonna start our thread and lay
down<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:16.200> quick<00:00:17.200> base<00:00:19.740> next<00:00:20.740> thing<00:00:20.890> we're<00:00:21.070> going

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
down a quick base next thing we're going

down a quick base next thing we're going
to<00:00:21.310> do<00:00:21.580> is<00:00:21.790> we're<00:00:21.940> gonna<00:00:22.029> tie<00:00:22.360> in<00:00:22.540> our<00:00:22.750> tails

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to do is we're gonna tie in our tails

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.859 
to do is we're gonna tie in our tails
for<00:00:24.939> this<00:00:25.090> we're<00:00:25.360> just<00:00:25.390> going<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.689> use<00:00:25.750> a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
for this we're just going to use a

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.089 
for this we're just going to use a
little<00:00:26.200> bit<00:00:26.260> of<00:00:26.320> hackle<00:00:26.710> fibers<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.740> we<00:00:29.890> want

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
little bit of hackle fibers and we want

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.920 
little bit of hackle fibers and we want
those<00:00:30.310> to<00:00:30.340> be<00:00:30.520> roughly<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.060> length<00:00:31.360> of<00:00:31.720> the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
those to be roughly the length of the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.400 
those to be roughly the length of the
shank<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.529> hook<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.420> we<00:00:37.720> tie<00:00:37.900> those<00:00:38.140> in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
shank of the hook and we tie those in

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.060 
shank of the hook and we tie those in
right<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:38.739> top<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.480> we<00:00:43.870> take<00:00:44.140> our<00:00:44.410> thread<00:00:44.710> form

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
right on top and we take our thread form

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.850 
right on top and we take our thread form
just<00:00:45.580> with<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.060> rest<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.050> butt<00:00:47.530> ends<00:00:47.800> of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
just with the rest the butt ends of

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.630 
just with the rest the butt ends of
those<00:00:47.950> hackle<00:00:48.370> fibers<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.980> do<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.310> just<00:00:51.550> to

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
those hackle fibers we do that just to

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.110 
those hackle fibers we do that just to
keep<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:52.030> nice<00:00:52.180> smooth<00:00:52.870> body<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.670> next<00:00:57.940> thing

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120

away from the eye now we're going to
take<00:01:38.590> this<00:01:38.740> Biot

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.780 

and<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:48.940> are<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.510> wrap<00:01:49.750> this<00:01:50.110> around<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
and we are going to wrap this around the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.630 
and we are going to wrap this around the
hook<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:54.460> take<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.790> forward<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:56.580> try<00:01:57.580> to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
hook as we take it forward I try to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.969 
hook as we take it forward I try to
overlap<00:01:58.120> just<00:01:58.480> a<00:01:58.660> little<00:01:58.930> bit<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.470> my<00:01:59.770> dry

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
overlap just a little bit on my dry

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.560 
overlap just a little bit on my dry
flies<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:01.650> like<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:03.040> have<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.430> ridges<00:02:03.670> hiding<00:02:04.420> I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
flies I like to have the ridges hiding I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.779 
flies I like to have the ridges hiding I
don't<00:02:04.720> like<00:02:04.900> them<00:02:05.080> necessarily<00:02:05.560> showing<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.729> I

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
don't like them necessarily showing so I

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:41.479 
don't like them necessarily showing so I
try<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.119> wrap<00:02:10.360> over<00:02:10.570> those<00:02:10.929> little<00:02:11.230> ridges

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:50.720 

tie<00:02:42.489> off<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.700> Biot<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.760> trim<00:02:46.120> out<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.299> extra

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.710 

next<00:02:51.730> thing<00:02:51.849> we're<00:02:51.970> gonna<00:02:52.060> do<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.480> we're<00:02:52.629> going

next thing we're gonna do is we're going
to<00:02:52.780> tie<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.670> post<00:02:54.670> for<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.209> parachute

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
to tie in the post for the parachute

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.910 
to tie in the post for the parachute
here<00:02:58.629> I'm<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.959> using<00:02:59.170> some<00:02:59.319> Antron<00:02:59.890> yarn<00:03:01.920> we

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
here I'm just using some Antron yarn we

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
here I'm just using some Antron yarn we
secure<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:06.480> once<00:03:07.480> we've<00:03:07.690> secured<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.940> yarn

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
secure that once we've secured the yarn

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
secure that once we've secured the yarn
to<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.239> hook<00:03:10.390> we're<00:03:10.629> just<00:03:10.780> gonna<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.849> around

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
to the hook we're just gonna go around

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.240 
to the hook we're just gonna go around
horizontally<00:03:14.730> around<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.940> piece<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.329> Antron

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
horizontally around that piece of Antron

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.229 
horizontally around that piece of Antron
this<00:03:18.250> will<00:03:18.459> give<00:03:18.640> us<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.940> base<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:21.000> wrap<00:03:22.000> our

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
this will give us a base to wrap our

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:31.850 
this will give us a base to wrap our
hackle<00:03:22.660> on<00:03:22.780> to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:43.910 

just<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:32.880> so

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.750 

put<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.100> down<00:03:45.160> here<00:03:45.670> for<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.060> little<00:03:46.180> bit

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
put this down here for you a little bit

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.990 
put this down here for you a little bit
let's<00:03:48.760> see<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.090> old<00:03:49.240> better<00:03:50.490> now<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:51.550> next

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
let's see you old better now the next

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.340 
let's see you old better now the next
thing<00:03:52.120> we're<00:03:52.240> gonna<00:03:52.360> do<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:52.660> we're<00:03:52.960> gonna<00:03:53.020> tie

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna tie

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.590 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna tie
in<00:03:53.530> our<00:03:54.720> hackle<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.790> real<00:03:58.000> quickly<00:03:58.300> just

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
in our hackle and real quickly just

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.330 
in our hackle and real quickly just
measure<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.140> we<00:03:59.380> want<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.740> stick<00:04:00.160> out

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
measure this we want it to stick out

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.630 
measure this we want it to stick out
almost<00:04:03.690> back<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.960> the<00:04:05.080> tail

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
almost back to the tail

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.910 
almost back to the tail
see<00:04:06.640> how<00:04:06.820> it's<00:04:07.000> covering<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.510> body<00:04:07.720> there<00:04:10.920> now

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
see how it's covering the body there now

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.830 
see how it's covering the body there now
we're<00:04:12.190> gonna<00:04:12.280> wrap<00:04:12.520> that<00:04:12.820> piece<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.300> hackle<00:04:13.690> in

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
we're gonna wrap that piece of hackle in

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.349
