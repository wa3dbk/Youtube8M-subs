00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.230
 sometimes in 2013 1,000 ps reported of that 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.330
 motorcycle novelties 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.100
 Now we are at the booth of kawasaki 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.530
 next to me 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.440
 is Andreas Seiler's first press officer 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.310
 from kawasaki germany and we stand 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.369
 here from currently 1000 andreas the zx 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.830
 1000 has already been presented and the z 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.680
 1000 is just or just became 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.020
 a few hours reveals what can 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.480
 you tell us about the motorcycle opposite 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.309
 to the z 1000 sx models 2014 yes 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.070
 not so drastic change 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.320
 Optical Art shows is the new 2000 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 completely revised and the am 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.040
 the most obvious is the new design 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.809
 we have a clear pure street here 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.640
 fighter design that starts here in front 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.370
 at the front mask with led headlight 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.080
 The technology is low and close to the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.570
 fork is mounted or sits down in 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.940
 This little line continued this design 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.610
 in kawasaki the kawasaki designer like that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.909
 rubber design so rubber stands for strong 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.170
 character strong personality like you 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.330
 it is with the engine that is the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.390
 same as in the old or has become 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.090
 because something is done so the mode base is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.770
 but it has been heavily revised 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.000
 For example, we have compensation 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.340
 holes between the cylinders 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.079
 reduce point losses 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.880
 we just have other camshafts on 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.219
 the intake camshaft is dropped 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.140
 This optimizes a bit of it 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.350
 the torque and performance in the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.079
 lower and middle speed range 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.609
 we have two occasions for the 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.100
 airbox now have here 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.479
 Of course, this also requires another 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.439
 Mapping gives the motorcycle just needs 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.850
 be matched 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.740
 The exhaust system is a bit 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.969
 different from the sound of the sound 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.320
 also changes decisively 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.719
 invites you to this four stop 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.700
 in the airbox the motorcycle still sound 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.869
 times clearly pithier and have at the end 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.149
 we even have four to five at the top 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.219
 ps packed on it so really something 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.259
 rumgekommen very cool and the 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.520
 tuning is now chassis technology 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.270
 I think something sporty like when 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.560
 previous model 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.909
 We believe I have the gift of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.770
 16 36 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.899
 right in front we have it with the sun 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.789
 called big runs sap function front 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.800
 People know we have this 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.660
 thick piston no cartridge no 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.099
 cartouche in the fork and we have on 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.260
 one side that's the trick of 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.879
 John Ford on one side of the pen 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.000
 on the other side the damping 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.840
 elements the fork is straight on the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.950
 Brake nice stable favored 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.110
 actual sport as it is driving 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.830
 nevertheless comfortable enough 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.690
 accordingly had the increased 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.220
 Rear adjustments also make that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.650
 keeping the vehicle in balance 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.610
 the vehicle said another one 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.750
 a bit sporty than that 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.099
 predecessor water already quite 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.019
 athletic was still holding 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.420
 transparent offers even more feedback 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.650
 you can wrap even more sharply for that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.959
 just before briefly cut the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.940
 also wants to brake new or 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.440
 direction is working properly we have to 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.150
 this is also a difference too 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.459
 2006 3 110 110 mm slices before were 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.049
 it's 300 and we now have one-piece 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.180
 calipers the advantage of this 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.170
 one-piece tokyo principle is that the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.819
 not so easy to rise 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.410
 entertainer burden that means we 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.239
 have better dosability more 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.530
 Stability and more until the 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.660
 brake pads are again more 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.850
 ps designed so everything in the direction of more 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.350
 Aggressiveness on this motorcycle 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.750
 But that's not the only novelty 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.160
 at kawasaki we still have behind us 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.670
 one agrees with the treatment as in the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.670
 second video
