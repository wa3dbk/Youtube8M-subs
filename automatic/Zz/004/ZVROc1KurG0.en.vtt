00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
you should always weigh your protein
powder<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> something<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.879> just

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
powder so this is something I just

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.270 
powder so this is something I just
recently<00:00:42.450> found<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.070> glad

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
recently found out and I'm very glad

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
recently found out and I'm very glad
that<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.520> did<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> guys<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.260> i<00:00:46.410> started

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that I did so as you guys know i started

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.830 
that I did so as you guys know i started
my<00:00:46.890> prep<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> week<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> half<00:00:47.820> ago<00:00:48.120> with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
my prep about a week and a half ago with

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.130 
my prep about a week and a half ago with
tyler<00:00:49.260> maher<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.800> Team<00:00:50.129> T&amp;T<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> being<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> lot

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
tyler maher and Team T&amp;T so being a lot

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
tyler maher and Team T&amp;T so being a lot
more<00:00:52.199> accurate<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.949> tracking<00:00:53.309> our<00:00:53.550> macros

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
more accurate with tracking our macros

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
more accurate with tracking our macros
and<00:00:54.350> whatnot<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.239> we'll<00:00:57.239> take<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> scoop<00:00:57.780> here

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and whatnot so we'll take a scoop here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.459 
and whatnot so we'll take a scoop here
this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> pretty<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.469> rounded

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this is a pretty as you can see rounded

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
this is a pretty as you can see rounded
off<00:01:01.590> scoop<00:01:01.859> will<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.129> sure<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.399> run<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> off

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
off scoop will make sure and run it off

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.410 
off scoop will make sure and run it off
real<00:01:03.059> good<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> google<00:01:06.030> protein

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
real good so that it's a google protein

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.440 
real good so that it's a google protein
we're<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> put<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> cup<00:01:08.159> okay<00:01:09.150> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
we're going to put it in the cup okay so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.969 
we're going to put it in the cup okay so
that's<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.810> scoop<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> protein<00:01:10.320> say<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> want

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that's one scoop of protein say you want

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.580 
that's one scoop of protein say you want
to<00:01:11.040> shake<00:01:11.220> we're<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
to shake we're just going to do a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
to shake we're just going to do a
theoretical<00:01:13.590> theoretical<00:01:14.520> situation<00:01:15.060> here

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
theoretical theoretical situation here

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
theoretical theoretical situation here
there's<00:01:16.140> another<00:01:16.470> scoop<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.430> see

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
there's another scoop as you can see

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.800 
there's another scoop as you can see
round<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> off<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> top<00:01:19.610> put<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.820> we

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
round it off at the top put it in we

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
round it off at the top put it in we
have<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.259> dymatize<00:01:22.920> elite<00:01:22.950> whey<00:01:23.939> protein

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
have some dymatize elite whey protein

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
have some dymatize elite whey protein
isolate<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:25.350> may<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.650> true<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.130> all

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
isolate this may be true with all

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.600 
isolate this may be true with all
proteins<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.090> may<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:28.310> would<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.340> if

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
proteins it may not be I would think if

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359 
proteins it may not be I would think if
anything<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> might<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> opposite<00:01:32.159> with

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
anything it might be the opposite with

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
anything it might be the opposite with
other<00:01:32.579> proteins<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.180> let<00:01:33.329> me<00:01:33.360> let<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.630> just

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
other proteins but let me let me just

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.230 
other proteins but let me let me just
continue<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:34.860> talking<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.030> looks

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
continue what I'm talking on so it looks

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
continue what I'm talking on so it looks
like<00:01:36.329> what<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.049> 49<00:01:37.829> grams<00:01:38.159> okay

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
like what we have here is 49 grams okay

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
like what we have here is 49 grams okay
so<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.900> look<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.159> back<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so if you look at the back of this

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.590 
so if you look at the back of this
container<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
container just can see that as you can

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.950 
container just can see that as you can
see<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> serving<00:01:46.470> size<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> scoop<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.960> 32.4

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
see a serving size or a scoop is 32.4

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.800 
see a serving size or a scoop is 32.4
grams<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.700> theory<00:01:51.299> mmm<00:01:52.340> two<00:01:53.340> scoops<00:01:53.810> should

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
grams so in theory mmm two scoops should

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.760 
grams so in theory mmm two scoops should
be<00:01:55.880> 64.8<00:01:56.880> grams<00:01:57.329> right<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.560> weigh<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
be 64.8 grams right or you can weigh it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
be 64.8 grams right or you can weigh it
or<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.280> could<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.579> what<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.450> call<00:02:00.600> them

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
or you could have what do you call them

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.010 
or you could have what do you call them
round<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.469> 65<00:02:02.219> grams<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
round it up to 65 grams but this like I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.940 
round it up to 65 grams but this like I
said<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.500> only<00:02:04.740> 49<00:02:05.369> grams<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.530> let<00:02:07.530> me<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.740> some

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
said is only 49 grams so let me do some

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.609 
said is only 49 grams so let me do some
quick<00:02:08.190> quick<00:02:08.940> math<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> guys<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:10.440> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
quick quick math for you guys this is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680 
quick quick math for you guys this is
just<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.340> simple<00:02:11.670> calculations<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.569> we

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just just simple calculations but if we

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.500 
just just simple calculations but if we
take<00:02:12.870> 49<00:02:14.420> grams<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:15.959> divide<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.500> into

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
take 49 grams and we divide it into

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.729 
take 49 grams and we divide it into
again<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:18.660> would<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.870> lets<00:02:19.170> say<00:02:19.230> 65<00:02:19.709> grams

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
again what would be lets say 65 grams

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.839 
again what would be lets say 65 grams
you're<00:02:22.739> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.099> be<00:02:23.220> getting<00:02:23.750> 75%<00:02:24.750> excuse<00:02:25.680> me

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
you're going to be getting 75% excuse me

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.479 
you're going to be getting 75% excuse me
you're<00:02:26.849> going<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.270> getting<00:02:27.530> 75%<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
you're going to be getting 75% of the

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.640 
you're going to be getting 75% of the
stated<00:02:29.879> amount<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.180> protein<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.379> times

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
stated amount of protein so if you times

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.850 
stated amount of protein so if you times
that<00:02:31.860> seventy-five<00:02:32.610> percent<00:02:32.870> by<00:02:33.870> 24<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.910> is

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that seventy-five percent by 24 which is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.290 
that seventy-five percent by 24 which is
let<00:02:37.860> me<00:02:37.950> stay<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.370> how<00:02:38.670> much<00:02:38.849> protein

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
let me stay here how much protein

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.790 
let me stay here how much protein
obviously<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> says<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.230> back<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.470> want

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
obviously it says on the back just want

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.210 
obviously it says on the back just want
to<00:02:40.860> make<00:02:40.950> sure<00:02:41.660> in<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.780> reality<00:02:43.019> you're<00:02:44.010> only

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
to make sure in a reality you're only

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.009 
to make sure in a reality you're only
getting<00:02:47.510> 18.09083<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.720> bit<00:02:51.840> larger

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
getting 18.09083 a little bit larger

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.220 
getting 18.09083 a little bit larger
than<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> serving<00:02:53.069> size<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.989> end<00:02:55.019> up

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
than the serving size so that you end up

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.320 
than the serving size so that you end up
using<00:02:55.260> their<00:02:55.650> product<00:02:56.040> quicker<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.120> this

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
using their product quicker but in this

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.570 
using their product quicker but in this
case<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.349> end<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:58.680> getting<00:02:58.980> less

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
case you actually end up getting less

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.520 
case you actually end up getting less
protein<00:02:59.879> for<00:03:00.480> how<00:03:00.810> much<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.110> actually<00:03:01.230> mean

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
protein for how much you actually mean

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.930 
protein for how much you actually mean
so<00:03:02.420> we<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.569> take<00:03:03.720> another<00:03:04.340> say<00:03:05.340> half<00:03:05.489> scoop<00:03:05.760> or

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
so we can take another say half scoop or

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:19.420 
so we can take another say half scoop or
so<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> see<00:03:08.370> where<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.670> gets<00:03:08.849> us<00:03:09.090> to

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.110 

right<00:03:20.180> there<00:03:20.390> there<00:03:20.569> are<00:03:20.599> 64<00:03:21.230> grams<00:03:22.090> with<00:03:23.090> a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
right there there are 64 grams with a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.940 
right there there are 64 grams with a
two<00:03:23.900> scoops<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.349> a<00:03:24.469> half<00:03:24.650> some<00:03:25.069> reality<00:03:26.950> there

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
two scoops and a half some reality there

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.420 
two scoops and a half some reality there
there's<00:03:28.310> our<00:03:28.430> 35<00:03:28.939> grams<00:03:29.349> so<00:03:30.349> you<00:03:31.099> end<00:03:31.310> up

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
there's our 35 grams so you end up

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.209 
there's our 35 grams so you end up
needing<00:03:32.319> around<00:03:33.319> two<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.739> half<00:03:33.890> scoops

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
needing around two and a half scoops

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.940 
needing around two and a half scoops
with<00:03:34.609> this<00:03:34.849> particular<00:03:35.030> protein<00:03:35.780> again<00:03:36.739> just

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
with this particular protein again just

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.410 
with this particular protein again just
a<00:03:37.040> quick<00:03:37.219> tip<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.579> wanted<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.879> note<00:03:38.180> for<00:03:38.359> you

a quick tip I wanted to note for you
guys<00:03:38.540> this<00:03:38.689> is<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:38.870> something<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.439> ever

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:39.469

guys this is not something I ever
thought<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.760> thought<00:03:40.969> these<00:03:41.090> scoops<00:03:41.389> were

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
thought of I thought these scoops were

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.830 
thought of I thought these scoops were
pretty<00:03:42.079> well<00:03:42.349> around<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.459> realm<00:03:44.420> or<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
pretty well around the realm or the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.860 
pretty well around the realm or the
spectrum<00:03:45.409> excuse<00:03:45.709> me<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:46.549> what<00:03:46.849> what<00:03:47.780> it

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
spectrum excuse me of what what it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.330 
spectrum excuse me of what what it
should<00:03:48.079> be<00:03:48.230> with<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.530> protein<00:03:48.980> but<00:03:49.159> in

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
should be with the protein but in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.789 
should be with the protein but in
reality<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.239> said<00:03:50.299> way<00:03:50.989> your<00:03:51.170> protein<00:03:51.560> and

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
reality like I said way your protein and

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.069 
reality like I said way your protein and
you<00:03:51.889> might<00:03:52.069> find<00:03:52.280> out<00:03:52.669> otherwise<00:03:52.939> so<00:03:53.450> if<00:03:53.930> you

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
you might find out otherwise so if you
