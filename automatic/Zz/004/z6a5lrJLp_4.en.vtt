00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
computers nowadays I think it's so close

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.149 
computers nowadays I think it's so close
to<00:03:26.639> being<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:27.000> personal<00:03:27.480> computer<00:03:27.799> but<00:03:28.799> not

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
to being a personal computer but not

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.339 
to being a personal computer but not
quite<00:03:29.639> there<00:03:29.969> are<00:03:30.060> limitations<00:03:30.480> put<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.109> by

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
quite there are limitations put on by

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.800 
quite there are limitations put on by
the<00:03:31.379> manufacturers<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.579> lot<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.819> cases<00:03:33.030> but

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the manufacturers in a lot of cases but

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.420

I think some of the iphones are going to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.709 
I think some of the iphones are going to
turn<00:03:35.609> out<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.790> be<00:03:36.060> i<00:03:36.239> mean<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.629> great

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
well I start out in the computer design

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.249 
well I start out in the computer design
the<00:04:20.579> Apple<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.940> was<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.599> whole<00:04:21.750> start<00:04:22.079> of

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
the Apple to was like the whole start of

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.499 
the Apple to was like the whole start of
computer<00:04:22.770> gaming<00:04:23.009> and<00:04:23.310> led<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> lot<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.300> it

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
computer gaming and led to a lot of it

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.360 
computer gaming and led to a lot of it
but<00:04:24.720> eventually<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.349> had<00:04:25.590> my<00:04:25.770> own<00:04:25.860> children<00:04:26.070> and

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
but eventually I had my own children and

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.310 
but eventually I had my own children and
they<00:04:26.550> were<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:26.849> much<00:04:26.970> better<00:04:27.030> at<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.960> modern

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
they were so much better at the modern

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.749 
they were so much better at the modern
games<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.889> I<00:04:28.919> kind<00:04:29.159> of<00:04:29.280> stayed<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
games that I kind of stayed to the

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.570 
games that I kind of stayed to the
simple<00:04:30.090> puzzle<00:04:30.720> type<00:04:30.930> games<00:04:31.199> myself<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:32.550> know

put so much time and energy into it I
used<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.780> create<00:04:43.020> electronic<00:04:43.500> things<00:04:43.889> that<00:04:44.550> I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580

that so maybe a thing that this new

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.570 
that so maybe a thing that this new
generation<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.560> going<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.890> be<00:05:11.010> able<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.340> accept

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
to a hundred percent I don't think that

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.550 
to a hundred percent I don't think that
I<00:05:32.040> think<00:05:32.310> this<00:05:32.430> room<00:05:32.790> for<00:05:33.240> other<00:05:34.080> types<00:05:34.380> of

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
I think this room for other types of

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.840 
I think this room for other types of
learning<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:35.070> like<00:05:35.250> this<00:05:35.400> room<00:05:35.580> for<00:05:35.760> other

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
learning just like this room for other

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.970 
learning just like this room for other
types<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.240> games<00:05:36.450> too<00:05:36.750> but<00:05:37.680> it's<00:05:37.830> just

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
types of games too but it's just

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.320 
types of games too but it's just
possibility<00:05:38.700> it's<00:05:38.790> one<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.210> alternatives

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
possibility it's one of the alternatives

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.720 
possibility it's one of the alternatives
now<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.650> know<00:05:40.740> what<00:05:40.890> some<00:05:41.280> people<00:05:41.610> will

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
now and you know what some people will

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.640 
now and you know what some people will
learn<00:05:41.880> better<00:05:42.180> that<00:05:42.450> way<00:05:42.660> than<00:05:42.870> they<00:05:43.200> learn<00:05:43.410> in

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
learn better that way than they learn in

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.690 
learn better that way than they learn in
the<00:05:44.130> more<00:05:45.380> realistic<00:05:46.380> non<00:05:46.650> virtual<00:05:47.160> world<00:05:47.370> but

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
the more realistic non virtual world but

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.420 
the more realistic non virtual world but
if<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:47.970> computer<00:05:48.510> could<00:05:49.260> ever<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.920> programmed

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
if a computer could ever be programmed

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.230 
if a computer could ever be programmed
enough<00:05:50.820> to<00:05:51.330> be<00:05:52.110> like<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.350> teacher<00:05:52.790> well<00:05:53.790> one<00:05:54.180> of

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
enough to be like a teacher well one of

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.610 
enough to be like a teacher well one of
the<00:05:54.330> things<00:05:54.360> is<00:05:54.660> like<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.050> other<00:05:55.350> people

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
the things is like the other people

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.660 
the things is like the other people
starting<00:05:55.890> to<00:05:55.950> talk<00:05:56.070> about<00:05:56.220> this<00:05:56.400> but<00:05:56.550> I've

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
starting to talk about this but I've

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.370 
starting to talk about this but I've
been<00:05:56.760> talking<00:05:57.060> for<00:05:57.180> some<00:05:57.270> time<00:05:57.450> recognize<00:05:58.200> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
been talking for some time recognize the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.500 
been talking for some time recognize the
students<00:05:58.710> facial<00:05:59.040> expressions<00:05:59.400> know<00:05:59.700> when<00:06:00.030> to

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
students facial expressions know when to

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.090 
students facial expressions know when to
change<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.840> subject<00:06:01.140> know<00:06:01.350> what<00:06:01.590> tone<00:06:01.920> of

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
change the subject know what tone of

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.010 
change the subject know what tone of
voice<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.610> use<00:06:02.880> that<00:06:03.420> sort<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.690> thing<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.870> a

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
voice to use that sort of thing that a

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.870 
voice to use that sort of thing that a
human<00:06:04.260> being<00:06:04.380> does<00:06:04.890> we<00:06:05.280> don't<00:06:05.400> really<00:06:05.610> have

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
human being does we don't really have

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.360 
human being does we don't really have
programs<00:06:06.300> so<00:06:06.480> we've<00:06:06.660> really<00:06:07.020> not<00:06:07.620> made<00:06:07.980> very

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
programs so we've really not made very

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.190 
programs so we've really not made very
much<00:06:08.550> progress<00:06:08.850> in<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.300> areas<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:09.600> artificial

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
much progress in the areas of artificial

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.560 
much progress in the areas of artificial
intelligence<00:06:10.260> of<00:06:10.950> a<00:06:11.370> machine<00:06:11.550> seem<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.420> be

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
intelligence of a machine seem to be

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.870 
intelligence of a machine seem to be
like<00:06:12.750> a<00:06:12.780> human<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:13.440> think<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.310> will<00:06:14.520> never<00:06:14.670> get

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
like a human I think it will never get

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.850 
like a human I think it will never get
there<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.600> don't<00:06:16.320> think<00:06:16.350> we'll<00:06:16.530> ever<00:06:16.560> have<00:06:16.830> a

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
there I don't think we'll ever have a

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.090 
there I don't think we'll ever have a
robot<00:06:17.610> that<00:06:17.760> can<00:06:17.850> make<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.030> cup<00:06:18.270> of<00:06:18.360> coffee<00:06:18.420> I

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
robot that can make a cup of coffee I

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.430 
robot that can make a cup of coffee I
mean<00:06:20.100> walk<00:06:20.550> into<00:06:20.850> a<00:06:20.880> house<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.480> you<00:06:22.260> could

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
mean walk into a house and you could

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.780 
mean walk into a house and you could
walk<00:06:22.590> into<00:06:22.740> my<00:06:22.920> house<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.340> could<00:06:23.550> maybe

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
walk into my house and you could maybe

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.030 
walk into my house and you could maybe
make<00:06:24.030> a<00:06:24.090> cup<00:06:24.330> of<00:06:24.450> coffee<00:06:24.510> but<00:06:25.290> I<00:06:25.320> think<00:06:25.950> the

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
make a cup of coffee but I think the

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.350 
make a cup of coffee but I think the
robot<00:06:26.370> would<00:06:26.460> had<00:06:26.640> to<00:06:26.670> go<00:06:26.790> through<00:06:27.000> all<00:06:27.030> the

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
robot would had to go through all the

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
robot would had to go through all the
learning<00:06:27.720> you've<00:06:27.870> gone<00:06:28.050> through<00:06:28.260> in<00:06:28.350> your

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
learning you've gone through in your

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.320 
learning you've gone through in your
life<00:06:28.530> of<00:06:28.890> how<00:06:29.310> to<00:06:29.370> hold<00:06:29.640> things<00:06:29.790> how<00:06:29.970> to<00:06:30.060> search

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
life of how to hold things how to search

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.880

machine<00:06:32.870> it's<00:06:33.870> so<00:06:34.350> many<00:06:34.710> tasks<00:06:35.070> that<00:06:35.550> it's

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
machine it's so many tasks that it's

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.580 
machine it's so many tasks that it's
hard<00:06:35.910> to<00:06:36.030> imagine<00:06:36.120> one<00:06:36.600> person<00:06:36.960> doing<00:06:37.380> it

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
hard to imagine one person doing it

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.370 
hard to imagine one person doing it
unless<00:06:37.710> some<00:06:38.280> young<00:06:38.520> person<00:06:39.000> maybe<00:06:39.570> 16<00:06:40.140> years

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
unless some young person maybe 16 years

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.200 
unless some young person maybe 16 years
old<00:06:40.620> decides<00:06:41.370> it's<00:06:41.550> going<00:06:41.670> to<00:06:41.730> be<00:06:41.790> the<00:06:41.880> goal<00:06:42.060> of
