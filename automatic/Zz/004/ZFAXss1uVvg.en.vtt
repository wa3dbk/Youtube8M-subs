00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.180
 and so I was engaged in growth for 20 years and lived 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.619
 life let's say so 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.740
 queens exchange has achieved a lot 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:12.090
 something we did not achieve too 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.560
 higher results in the world of cross 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.650
 it was very hard to have not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.470
 only fast speed but also good 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 endurance and good support i 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.750
 let's say I did not feel that I can 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.440
 become a world champion and ride on 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.239
 I already had some championship in Ukraine 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.590
 so probably decided the first 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.810
 queue for himself that I motocross he 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.910
 stop doing decided to try 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.620
 supermoto 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.340
 initially last year just for the sake of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.200
 interest because how would the home stage for 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.360
 a wild 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 just tried it for yourself 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.230
 probably liked it because something 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.890
 new have something to learn on the pavement 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.860
 There is something to be decided to try 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.120
 and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.730
 this season 2013 fight for 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.900
 championship title 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.370
 super moto can not say that it is 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 terribly professional training and 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.510
 classes because I know how to 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.150
 professionally prepared and paid 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.890
 very a lot of attention that I have more than 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.660
 it's at the amateur level 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.910
 but I think we'll see how it ends. 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.780
 season but I think some results 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.780
 must be 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.700
 so let's say a versatile look 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.970
 sport in which you need to be able to very much 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.050
 a lot of all sorts of skills skills skill 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.590
 and speed 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.770
 technical skills hardy 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.500
 that is super 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:07.530
 super moto here is very high speed 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.090
 on supermoto 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.400
 You can probably buy it for cross-country 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.070
 the passage of fast speed sections 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.290
 because even now I drive 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.600
 supermoto but there is a print of cross 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.260
 since I have the high-speed turns 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.380
 do not work and have each 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.270
 athlete some kind of speed limit 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.970
 who is probably on supermoto this 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.960
 the limit can be removed a little by 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.080
 this appearance appears this year 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.890
 ground areas on supermoto tracks 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.650
 I consider that 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.630
 Krazmeny and those who are engaged in purely 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.210
 motocross can come themselves 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.180
 try in this discipline and 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.700
 supermoto because soil sites 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:58.320
 will give them a plus everywhere thereby 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.320
 realize your ambitions 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.870
 and my skills are cross-learned a little bit 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.990
 asphalt discipline 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.660
 it is supermoto so I think that 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.710
 everyone has to 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.950
 try and see maybe someone 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.040
 more will go on supermoto 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:24.380
 mixed some areas of asphalt soil 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.380
 and people will like it more 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.640
 I am very hard to say so definitely on 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.520
 wrestling fight or not i think 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.160
 uniquely in season 2013 people supermoto 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.900
 I mean those who perform on 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.640
 Ukraine will go faster will not progress 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.050
 I know how to be prepared and to 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.860
 Russian athletes 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.980
 they, I believe that the well is a little higher 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.330
 level they drive and on world championships 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.310
 stand on international 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.910
 competitions 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:02.870
 therefore impose on them them not our struggle with 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.750
 Of course we will them I will personally 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.990
 but how it will be co-ordinated hard 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.210
 say because how could answer by 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.890
 cross up to pre would say know 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.060
 all athletes and know how they are 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:20.210
 prepared and watching what may 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.360
 change in season by supermoto i'm not 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.210
 so experienced we are not so able 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.180
 predict what may be on this 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.760
 The moment I did a little bit last year 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.820
 for myself some conclusions learned very 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.870
 much so this year I will try 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.710
 use all my knowledge 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.710
 previous year
