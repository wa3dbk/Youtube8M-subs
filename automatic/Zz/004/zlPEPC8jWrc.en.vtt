tongue<00:02:30.210> which<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.680> probably<00:02:31.830> would

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
tongue which I think we probably would

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.170 
tongue which I think we probably would
have<00:02:32.100> been<00:02:32.220> very<00:02:32.430> nice<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.000> done

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
have been very nice and it would done

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.710 
have been very nice and it would done
done<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.920> I'm<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.160> these<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.700> even<00:02:36.600> with

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
done then I'm on these but even with

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.540
