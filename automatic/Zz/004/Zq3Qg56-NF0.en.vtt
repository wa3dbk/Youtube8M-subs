00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
as you guys can tell with this case

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.850 
as you guys can tell with this case
there's<00:02:12.330> really<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.930> much<00:02:13.140> else<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.470> talk

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
there's really not much else to talk

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
there's really not much else to talk
without<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> iphone<00:02:14.730> inside<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:16.140> pretty

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
without the iphone inside it's a pretty

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.680 
without the iphone inside it's a pretty
simple<00:02:16.530> looking<00:02:16.980> case<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.360> let's<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.660> ahead

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
simple looking case so let's go ahead

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.090 
simple looking case so let's go ahead
and<00:02:18.810> pop<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> iphone<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.770> see<00:02:19.860> what<00:02:20.010> we're

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and pop the iphone in and see what we're

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.800 
and pop the iphone in and see what we're
working<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.500> iphone<00:02:22.830> 3g<00:02:23.510> slide<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.690> on

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
working with the iphone 3g slide it on

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.380 
working with the iphone 3g slide it on
in<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:27.440> very<00:02:28.440> tight<00:02:28.680> fit<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.520> as<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:30.180> see

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
in and very tight fit so as you can see

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
in and very tight fit so as you can see
sliding<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.810> iphone<00:02:31.140> into<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.440> case<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
sliding the iphone into this case is a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.910 
sliding the iphone into this case is a
very<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.030> tight<00:02:33.330> squeeze<00:02:33.680> my<00:02:34.680> first

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
very very tight squeeze my first

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.610 
very very tight squeeze my first
impression<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.180> iphone<00:02:36.570> is

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
impression is that the iphone is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.760 
impression is that the iphone is
completely<00:02:37.620> protected<00:02:38.130> within<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.300> case

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
completely protected within this case

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.530 
completely protected within this case
and<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.950> fits<00:02:41.190> perfectly<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:42.150> i<00:02:42.270> said<00:02:42.330> before

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and it fits perfectly like i said before

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.410 
and it fits perfectly like i said before
this<00:02:43.440> perfectly<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.400> i'm<00:02:45.240> not<00:02:45.360> really

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
this perfectly in here so i'm not really

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.270 
this perfectly in here so i'm not really
worried<00:02:45.810> about<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.140> iphone<00:02:46.440> sliding<00:02:46.860> out<00:02:46.980> or

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
worried about the iphone sliding out or

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.390 
worried about the iphone sliding out or
anything<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:49.650> nice<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:49.890> snug<00:02:50.280> in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
anything like that it's nice and snug in

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.300 
anything like that it's nice and snug in
there<00:02:51.140> once<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> iphone<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.650> inside<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.130> case

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
there once the iphone is inside the case

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.550 
there once the iphone is inside the case
it's<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.510> nearly<00:02:54.870> impossible<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.350> get<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it's really nearly impossible to get the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
it's really nearly impossible to get the
phone<00:02:55.709> out<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.160> without<00:02:56.670> using<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
phone out of there without using the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.199 
phone out of there without using the
pull<00:02:58.410> release<00:02:58.560> system<00:02:58.920> located<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.060> back

about the phone sliding out accidentally

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.590 
about the phone sliding out accidentally
you<00:03:40.260> know<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.530> your<00:03:40.620> backpack<00:03:40.860> purse<00:03:41.600> bag

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
you know in your backpack purse bag

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.680 
you know in your backpack purse bag
whatever<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.260> may<00:03:43.380> be<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.600> really

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
whatever it may be so this is a really

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.690 
whatever it may be so this is a really
cool<00:03:45.900> case<00:03:46.140> however<00:03:46.680> i'd<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.040> see<00:03:47.250> some

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
cool case however i'd like to see some

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.729 
cool case however i'd like to see some
more<00:03:47.790> functionality<00:03:48.480> out<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.840> there's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
more functionality out of it there's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.380 
more functionality out of it there's
really<00:03:49.860> no<00:03:50.100> openings<00:03:50.610> for<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:50.970> volume<00:03:51.360> rocker

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
really no openings for the volume rocker

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.170 
really no openings for the volume rocker
or<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.200> wrangler<00:03:52.470> on-off<00:03:52.739> switch<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.970> camera

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
or the wrangler on-off switch the camera

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.740 
or the wrangler on-off switch the camera
lens<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:55.110> speakers<00:03:55.620> or<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:57.090> dock<00:03:57.269> connector

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
lens the speakers or the dock connector

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.970 
lens the speakers or the dock connector
so<00:03:58.730> although<00:04:00.019> not<00:04:01.019> having<00:04:01.410> these<00:04:01.500> holes<00:04:01.769> makes

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
so although not having these holes makes

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.160 
so although not having these holes makes
for<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> much<00:04:02.340> safer<00:04:02.610> case<00:04:03.000> i<00:04:03.269> really<00:04:03.959> think

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
for a much safer case i really think

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.050 
for a much safer case i really think
that<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.590> hurts<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.890> iphones<00:04:05.370> functionality

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
that it hurts the iphones functionality

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.820 
that it hurts the iphones functionality
