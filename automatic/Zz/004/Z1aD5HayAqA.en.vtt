the<00:00:33.560> Dior<00:00:34.160> show<00:00:34.190> certainly<00:00:35.120> stood<00:00:35.690> out<00:00:35.900> I

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
the Dior show certainly stood out I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.160 
the Dior show certainly stood out I
think<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.190> that<00:00:37.220> goes<00:00:38.180> down<00:00:38.390> as<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.840> best

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
think that that goes down as the best

00:00:39.170 --> 00:01:18.190 
think that that goes down as the best
show<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.860> season<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:40.520> far

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
graph is it continues to explore the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
beginning but more and more it looks

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.160 
beginning but more and more it looks
like<00:01:42.900> graph<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.979> less<00:01:44.370> like<00:01:44.870> what<00:01:45.870> we<00:01:45.990> thought

I<00:03:17.819> think<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.750> color<00:03:18.990> at<00:03:19.230> Dior<00:03:19.530> was<00:03:19.830> just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I think the color at Dior was just

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.070 
I think the color at Dior was just
spectacular<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.599> love<00:03:21.840> seeing

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
color it's like who doesn't love like

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:58.840 
color it's like who doesn't love like
the<00:03:24.120> bright<00:03:24.300> colors<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.930> shoes<00:03:25.200> were<00:03:25.440> amazing

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.670 

the<00:03:59.850> thing<00:04:00.060> that's<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:01.049> great<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.440> think

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
the thing that's really great I think

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.390 
the thing that's really great I think
very<00:04:02.010> hard<00:04:02.220> for<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> designer<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.090> do<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:04.440> you

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
very hard for a designer to do is to you

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.370 
very hard for a designer to do is to you
know<00:04:05.519> establish<00:04:06.150> some<00:04:06.600> sort<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.840> identity

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
know establish some sort of identity

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.610 
know establish some sort of identity
that<00:04:07.530> like<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.920> girl<00:04:08.250> or<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> man<00:04:09.030> or<00:04:09.269> whomever

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
that like a girl or a man or whomever

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.750 
that like a girl or a man or whomever
recognizes<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.920> street<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.549> think

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
recognizes on the street and I think

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.309 
recognizes on the street and I think
that<00:04:11.850> he<00:04:12.000> has<00:04:12.090> been<00:04:12.180> able<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.569> do<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.720> edgy<00:04:13.140> or

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
that he has been able to do that edgy or

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.350 
that he has been able to do that edgy or
in<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.500> really<00:04:13.769> short<00:04:14.040> time<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.850> someone's

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
in a really short time like someone's

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.090 
in a really short time like someone's
going<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.510> walk<00:04:15.720> down<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:16.169> street<00:04:16.500> or<00:04:16.769> go<00:04:17.040> to

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
going to walk down the street or go to

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.129 
going to walk down the street or go to
into<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.519> party<00:04:17.910> with<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.239> pink<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.870> green
