planets called the terrestrial planets
there<00:00:43.780> they<00:00:43.960> are<00:00:43.989> again

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
there they are again

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
there they are again
the<00:00:47.050> inner<00:00:47.260> planets<00:00:47.739> are<00:00:48.070> closer<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.089> Sun

the inner planets are closer to the Sun

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.330 
the inner planets are closer to the Sun
though<00:00:51.760> they<00:00:51.940> are<00:00:52.059> going<00:00:52.359> around<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.780> Sun

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.410

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
maybe Jupiter looks like this from the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.890 
maybe Jupiter looks like this from the
surface<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.459> Io<00:03:14.230> that's<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.680> an<00:03:15.920> artist's

Titan her nose has an atmosphere

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.790 
Titan her nose has an atmosphere
Titan<00:03:52.490> is<00:03:52.700> bigger<00:03:53.060> than<00:03:53.300> our<00:03:53.480> moon<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.170> bigger

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
Titan is bigger than our moon and bigger

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.850 
Titan is bigger than our moon and bigger
also<00:03:55.220> than<00:03:55.580> mercury<00:03:56.330> and<00:03:56.630> Pluto

also than mercury and Pluto

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.640 
also than mercury and Pluto
here's<00:03:59.670> titan<00:04:00.240> right<00:04:00.450> here

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.210 

maybe<00:04:04.549> if<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.299> looked<00:04:05.599> at<00:04:05.780> Saturn<00:04:06.349> from<00:04:06.709> Titan

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
maybe if you looked at Saturn from Titan

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.360 
maybe if you looked at Saturn from Titan
it<00:04:07.489> would<00:04:07.760> look<00:04:07.940> like<00:04:08.000> this

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
it would look like this

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.059 
it would look like this
again<00:04:11.269> that's<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.989> an<00:04:12.470> artist's

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
again that's just a an artist's

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.520 
again that's just a an artist's
imagination<00:04:13.910> at<00:04:14.060> work

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.660 

next<00:04:18.459> are<00:04:18.640> two<00:04:19.120> more<00:04:19.420> gas<00:04:19.900> giants<00:04:20.530> Uranus<00:04:21.130> and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
next are two more gas giants Uranus and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.140 
next are two more gas giants Uranus and
Neptune<00:04:22.350> they<00:04:23.350> aren't<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:23.800> big<00:04:24.070> as<00:04:24.370> Jupiter<00:04:24.670> or

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
Neptune they aren't as big as Jupiter or

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.260 
Neptune they aren't as big as Jupiter or
Saturn<00:04:25.950> first<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.280> Uranus

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.080 

Uranus<00:04:32.270> has<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.480> ring<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.520> Uranus<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.700> strange

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
Uranus has a ring to Uranus is strange

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.610 
Uranus has a ring to Uranus is strange
because<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:35.690> rotates<00:04:36.170> on<00:04:36.410> its<00:04:36.650> side<00:04:38.410> see<00:04:39.410> how

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
because it rotates on its side see how

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.760 
because it rotates on its side see how
its<00:04:39.860> ring<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:40.520> sideways

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.790 

next<00:04:44.639> comes<00:04:44.910> Neptune<00:04:45.720> which<00:04:46.259> is<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> pretty

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
next comes Neptune which is a pretty

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.770 
next comes Neptune which is a pretty
blue

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.450 

and<00:04:51.470> rich<00:04:51.710> has<00:04:51.920> a<00:04:51.950> big<00:04:52.250> moon<00:04:52.520> called<00:04:53.120> Triton

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
and rich has a big moon called Triton

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.950 
and rich has a big moon called Triton
it's<00:04:56.240> an<00:04:56.420> actual<00:04:56.870> picture<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.350> Triton
