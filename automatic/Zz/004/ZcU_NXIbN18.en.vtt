00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.059
 can't say the battery is hot 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:19.820
 the house is really warm and with gas 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.220
 no electric boiler no heating 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.610
 from the air as I just explained 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.919
 Gleb, that is, this unit 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.259
 takes heat from the air yes that way 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.030
 rather it is the buffer capacity which 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.450
 energy is accumulated air which we 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.360
 pick up with the help of this unit 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.630
 outside we have a heat intake 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.920
 which already transfer chick 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.610
 let's not fooling 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 the viewer well, or almost -10 how warm you are 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 take our installation works up to -25 on 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.649
 actually take i'm stupid here 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.920
 questions I face it for the first time 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.710
 and I want to figure it out myself 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
 system coolant some yes water 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.540
 or is there a cold-resistant liquid no matter 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.649
 that closed loop is so well transfer 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.929
 heat extraction in warm air and transmission 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.880
 heat carrier that is roughly speaking water 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.189
 in batteries where does it all happen 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.569
 happening on the street here in this block up 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.359
 outdoor and this block what does and here 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:27.450
 it already transfers heat from freon to 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:30.329
 contour that works out from outside 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.979
 works gives off the heat of glycol that flows 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.969
 from batteries which is in this 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.829
 a barrel that is, but here is just a transfer 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.920
 heat between different colors means 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.259
 just a drive that's going on there 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 heat extraction here 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.899
 transfer to all and all control then 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.990
 here it seems his brain finds everything 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.709
 clear except the most important thing 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.209
 heat is taken if on the street minus 10 as 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.209
 not strange but the energy in the air is 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.030
 almost to absolute zero 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.130
 absolutely rows us there 307 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.830
 shedding space garage let's go back to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.390
 earth and so i know that there are heat 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.790
 pumps that take the heat of the earth days 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.720
 ground and land sought and no matter where there is 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.770
 at least there from the water that is in the ground there 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.660
 deep well at least plus 4 to 2 degrees 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.660
 can from there take there somehow 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.840
 reset the refrigerator for the contrary 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.200
 then plus equals goal slept pump it 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.930
 energy transfer from for example from the street to 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.420
 house of soil to the house that is, if we 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.370
 took the air and the temperature is minus 25 we 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.019
 we can also cool a little and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.019
 Generally pick up what you have in it 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.380
 nevertheless duck there coefficient 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.720
 conversions will not decrease you spend 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.239
 a little more energy but there 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.709
 the consumer is absolutely aware that 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.810
 ground heat pump installation 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.019
 it is expensive 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.420
 yeah bore holes dig trenches 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.900
 if there is no reservoir near under 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.720
 earth pipe and long and expensive and here is the box 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.380
 outside the box is a ceiling box and a barrel with 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.530
 water in the kitchen and if on the street below 25 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.079
 temperature is lower scoundrels 5 happens days 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.640
 so 10 a year and no big deal if we 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.579
 We are warming ourselves there 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.010
 person has a fireplace or if a person has 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.019
 there is an electric heater these 10 days 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.040
 they will not give us a big change 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.859
 economy well, well we warmed the house and how 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.320
 about the soul there are several ways out 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:41.239
 for hot water specific it is done 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.829
 so that we can take water more 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.920
 low temperature let's say for the sink 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.600
 for handwashing and so on with more 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.000
 high point where big hot 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.799
 coolant is we take already 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.049
 hot water for showers 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.700
 that is, it is such a saving too so that we 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.989
 have not spent the extra energy which is 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.370
 we have accumulated 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.530
 here is the decision she really 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.660
 massive if we compare capital 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.349
 the cost of bringing gas to the district 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:12.230
 coordination of legwork 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:13.459
 I seem to have a lot of money there myself 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.009
 always book 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.410
 what eyes people see us about this 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:22.220
 in this little window when we come with 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.380
 the paper set of the system is considered simply 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.990
 household appliance no approvals for 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.400
 it does not need and it works quite 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.080
 no pipes need it rubles servant and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.080
 she is absolutely safe here to explode 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.210
 nothing here without open fire just 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.870
 system 200 is working the road to new 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.940
 contour up to 300 take a sip and everything nearby 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.940
 the house is mounted a similar system 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.740
 more high-end there is help on the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.449
 the roof is set sunny 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.949
 collector 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.259
 if we allow on the apartment that you 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.090
 watched now we respect the equipment 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.860
 standard toris komplit times already premium 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.750
 here the opportunity arose more precisely 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.300
 speaking already there is a standard 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.340
 in principle, it may have appeared here 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.610
 supplement our equip system warm 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.099
 floors with a separate fence from the lowest point 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.020
 already tank buffer capacity plus this 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.599
 a cooling module will be added which 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.400
 there is a possibility of cooling behind me 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.440
 in the summer and also our solar collector 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.180
 when we just apply our yours 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.130
 a complete set of this station pumping 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.659
 solar collector and plus to this still 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.240
 there is one more reserve 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.130
 heat exchanger in this buffer tank 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.840
 let's say if the tenants want something 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.080
 put extra out of here melted 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.659
 boiler is possible gas from what perspective 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.970
 then he does not need to change anything 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.310
 just going to start the ships heat exchanger 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.500
 this is the most gas boiler here was a problem 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.940
 here is the problem in gas first of all 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.550
 the village will see that part of the houses 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.289
 gasified part no means that part 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.599
 which is not gasified heat sources 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.460
 and the miracle came into force diesel boilers 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.250
 someone puts and liter katukov 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.409
 years a period is possible 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.479
 it turns out that the glands become 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.699
 hostage to the situation namely what 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.130
 what brought before they brought pellets 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.509
 but hire an individual who 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.490
 this boiler house will be operated 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.530
 plus you need to create 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.630
 condominium your specifically here 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.130
 agree with your neighbor if you would put 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.960
 each person has a small diesel 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.490
 the boiler was getting very expensive because you 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.689
 you see that apartments are small, about 100 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.610
 square meters 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.409
 heat consumption 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.749
 about six seven kilowatts of power 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.159
 small enough and because to 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.139
 put such a little powerful equipment 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.449
 a day would be quite a lot and cost 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.279
 I could be held povodit diesel 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.469
 pellets constantly ie autonomy 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:36.229
 happened in principle we don't know how much 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:39.349
 a year will cost gas diesel fuel 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.129
 electricity but the sun and the air are hardly 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.019
 will rise in price 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.759
 rather give me buying such an apartment 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.709
 now it is not possible to put 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.509
 let's say solar collector on after 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.949
 after three or four years quietly can not 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.669
 buy his feet can 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.729
 get cheaper 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:56.869
 conditions fan coil yourself blog cooling then 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.209
 there is it can be modern calm too 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:01.159
 save but on this 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.989
 lay on the so-called which you saw in the tank 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.819
 it is worth it is possible to continue calmly 

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:07.009
 is already starting to engage in energy conservation 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:08.479
 with an individual farm I call 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.219
 individual heat point 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.219
 will point a person and that he should be his
