00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
and there are two different ways that I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.629 
and there are two different ways that I
would<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.680> would<00:00:13.830> either<00:00:14.010> brush<00:00:14.430> your

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
would do this I would either brush your

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.640 
would do this I would either brush your
hair<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.270> shower<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.900> conditioner<00:00:16.470> in

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
hair in the shower with conditioner in

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.189 
hair in the shower with conditioner in
it<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.210> most<00:00:18.360> slip<00:00:18.840> through

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
it so that you get the most slip through

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
it so that you get the most slip through
the<00:00:19.350> hair<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.860> that<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> tangles<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.730> very

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the hair so that the tangles can very

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.359 
the hair so that the tangles can very
easily<00:00:21.179> come<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.660> or<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.259> would<00:00:22.920> recommend

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
easily come out or I would recommend

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.669 
easily come out or I would recommend
right<00:00:23.669> after<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> shower<00:00:24.560> brushing<00:00:25.560> your

right after the shower brushing your
hair<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.400> always<00:00:26.669> like<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:26.999> a<00:00:27.119> wet

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
hair out I always like to use a wet

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.489 
hair out I always like to use a wet
brush<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.919> is<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.400> got<00:00:30.210> plastic

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
brush and what it is is it's got plastic

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.780 
brush and what it is is it's got plastic
bristles<00:00:31.499> but<00:00:31.829> they're<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.160> super<00:00:32.460> super

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
bristles but they're just super super

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
bristles but they're just super super
flexible<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.079> does<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:34.710> you're

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
flexible what that does is when you're

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.840 
flexible what that does is when you're
brushing<00:00:34.980> through<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> hair<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> meets

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
brushing through the hair and it meets

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
brushing through the hair and it meets
resistance<00:00:36.060> it<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.199> brushes<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:37.710> through

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
resistance it just brushes right through

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580 
resistance it just brushes right through
instead<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> being<00:00:38.789> so<00:00:39.090> stiff<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.809> pulling

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
instead of being so stiff and pulling

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
instead of being so stiff and pulling
the<00:00:40.800> tangle<00:00:41.219> it'll<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.000> Bend<00:00:42.379> until

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the tangle it'll just kind of Bend until

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
the tangle it'll just kind of Bend until
you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> tangle<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.699> is<00:00:44.760> my

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you can get to tangle out so this is my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.060

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
hair right in the shower I would

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
hair right in the shower I would
definitely<00:00:57.179> recommend<00:00:57.269> spritzing<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
if you had a bit coarser hair I would

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490

conditioner<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.160> this<00:01:08.310> part<00:01:08.580> too<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:09.390> gonna

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
conditioner at this part too I'm gonna

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.990 
conditioner at this part too I'm gonna
use<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> tiny<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.470> leave-in<00:01:11.160> conditioners<00:01:11.760> are

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
use a tiny bit leave-in conditioners are

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500 
use a tiny bit leave-in conditioners are
great<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.900> opposed<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.500> traditional

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
great as opposed to a traditional

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.340 
great as opposed to a traditional
conditioner<00:01:15.510> they're<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:16.080> lightweight

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
conditioner they're really lightweight

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.870 
conditioner they're really lightweight
so<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.880> almost<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.720> water<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.320> hair

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
so they're almost like water in the hair

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.250 
so they're almost like water in the hair
so<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.090> gonna<00:01:21.180> rake<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> through<00:01:22.110> with

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
so I'm just gonna rake that through with

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.190 
so I'm just gonna rake that through with
my<00:01:22.410> fingers<00:01:23.180> or<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.420> hair<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.720> really

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
my fingers or if your hair is really

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.060 
my fingers or if your hair is really
tangling

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
tangling

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580 
tangling
I<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.570> start<00:01:27.570> from<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> midway

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I would start from kind of midway

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
I would start from kind of midway
through<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:29.010> hair<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.550> way<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.120> ends

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
through the hair all the way to the ends

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
through the hair all the way to the ends
and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> brush<00:01:31.410> through<00:01:31.710> you're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and then as you brush through you're

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.400 
and then as you brush through you're
going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.310> brush<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:34.020> best<00:01:34.260> way<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
going to brush it the best way to

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.230 
going to brush it the best way to
detangle<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.400> separate<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.940> hair<00:01:36.120> into

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
detangle is to separate your hair into

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
detangle is to separate your hair into
sections<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.740> always<00:01:37.980> start<00:01:38.160> with<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
sections so I always start with the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.720

we<00:01:57.660> don't<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.410> fragile<00:01:58.920> because

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
we don't think that it's fragile because

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
we don't think that it's fragile because
it<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.330> such<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.540> pain<00:02:00.870> but<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.620> is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it can be such a pain but it really is

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.490 
it can be such a pain but it really is
fragile<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.490> gets<00:02:02.670> dry<00:02:02.970> quick<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:04.290> gets

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
fragile it gets dry quick it gets

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.340 
fragile it gets dry quick it gets
damaged<00:02:04.980> quick<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.150> think<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.780> most<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.260> us
