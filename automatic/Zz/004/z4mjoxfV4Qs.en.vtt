00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
things off get rid of the battery

switch on the bottom

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.040 
switch on the bottom
shave<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> few<00:00:15.929> grams<00:00:16.139> off<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:18.050> 180

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
shave it a few grams off of it 180

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
milliamp electron pro 45 C battery

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:35.709 
milliamp electron pro 45 C battery
weight<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.310> about<00:00:27.050> 16<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> half<00:00:28.260> grams<00:00:32.239> oh

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:01:35.690 

yeah<00:00:36.719> I'm<00:00:36.899> using<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.550> Hudson<00:00:38.550> Keith<00:00:39.390> Rx<00:00:39.989> for

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.770 

all<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.590 

that's<00:01:39.290> standard<00:01:39.980> rates<00:01:40.430> right<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.510> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
that's standard rates right and the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.820 
that's standard rates right and the
reason<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.900> keeps<00:01:41.990> on<00:01:42.170> dropping<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.650> because

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
reason it keeps on dropping is because

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.080 
reason it keeps on dropping is because
of<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:42.980> dead<00:01:43.310> band<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.730> middle<00:01:43.820> these

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
of that dead band in middle these

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.020 
of that dead band in middle these
transmitters<00:01:45.550> because<00:01:46.550> I'm<00:01:46.670> only<00:01:46.760> using

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
transmitters because I'm only using

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.370 
transmitters because I'm only using
about<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.330> wine<00:01:48.140> bottle<00:01:48.950> but<00:01:49.220> keep<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.000> upright

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
about a wine bottle but keep it upright

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.560 
about a wine bottle but keep it upright
big<00:01:51.380> props<00:01:51.650> big<00:01:52.010> motors<00:01:52.370> it's<00:01:52.520> over<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:52.880> so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
big props big motors it's over so so

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:03.450 
big props big motors it's over so so
these<00:01:53.690> are<00:01:53.840> double<00:01:54.050> right

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.090 

I'm<00:02:04.000> sure<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.570> Yahweh

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:28.530 

Oh

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:45.760 

takes<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.170> look<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.440> comes<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.950> them

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.710 

so<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.520> got<00:02:46.670> such<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> big<00:02:47.180> prop<00:02:48.490> disk

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so it's got such a big prop disk

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.490 
so it's got such a big prop disk
accretion<00:02:50.720> disk<00:02:50.900> or<00:02:51.050> whatever<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.350> wanna

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
accretion disk or whatever you wanna

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.640 
accretion disk or whatever you wanna
call<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:52.670> when<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:52.970> drop<00:02:53.300> it<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:54.470> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
call it that when you drop it and you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.640 
call it that when you drop it and you
get<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.390> catches<00:02:56.390> its<00:02:56.540> own<00:02:56.690> prop<00:02:56.960> wash<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
get it it catches its own prop wash it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:06.339 
get it it catches its own prop wash it
gets<00:02:58.160> all<00:02:58.280> messed<00:02:58.670> up

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.530 

so<00:03:06.890> that's<00:03:07.249> an<00:03:07.370> issue<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.939> that<00:03:08.150> could<00:03:08.299> be<00:03:08.390> why

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
so that's an issue and that could be why

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.599 
so that's an issue and that could be why
we<00:03:09.019> don't<00:03:09.140> see<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.409> lot<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.590> overlapping<00:03:10.189> props

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
we don't see a lot of overlapping props

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:20.300 
we don't see a lot of overlapping props
on<00:03:10.879> stuff

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.030 

yeah<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.510> nice<00:03:22.470> when<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.709> read<00:03:22.860> off

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
yeah we do that nice when you read off

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.750 
yeah we do that nice when you read off
and<00:03:23.370> driving<00:03:23.850> trying<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.360> yourself
