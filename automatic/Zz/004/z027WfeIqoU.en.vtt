get an additional piece we get this
little<00:02:09.899> bit<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
little bit here and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.869

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
is sort of a USB extension cable but

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.610 
is sort of a USB extension cable but
they've<00:02:14.999> styled<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.810> match<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.260> style<00:02:16.469> of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
they've styled it to match the style of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.709 
they've styled it to match the style of
the<00:02:16.739> microphone<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.819> plug<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.420> there

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
the microphone so you plug that in there

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.869 
the microphone so you plug that in there
and<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.560> plug<00:02:19.829> this<00:02:20.069> into<00:02:20.400> your<00:02:20.609> laptop

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
so that's great if you want to get it a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.199 
so that's great if you want to get it a
little<00:02:22.799> bit<00:02:22.980> further<00:02:23.189> away<00:02:23.459> from<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.879> actual

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
little bit further away from the actual

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.339 
little bit further away from the actual
laptop<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:25.829> it<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.099> that<00:02:26.249> packaging

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
laptop so that's it in that packaging

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.920 
laptop so that's it in that packaging
this<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.859> microphone<00:02:29.250> itself<00:02:29.629> now<00:02:30.629> I'm

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
this is the microphone itself now I'm

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.679 
this is the microphone itself now I'm
hoping<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.010> delivers<00:02:32.400> good<00:02:32.549> qualities<00:02:33.030> 49

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
hoping it delivers good qualities 49

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
comparison when i plug in that blue

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.030 
comparison when i plug in that blue
microphone<00:03:32.609> sticky<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:34.319> now<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:34.919> you're

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
microphone sticky so now what you're

microphone sticky so now what you're
hearing<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.669> audio<00:03:36.150> from<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.599> blue

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
hearing is audio from the blue

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.740 
hearing is audio from the blue
microphone<00:03:38.099> ticky<00:03:38.759> it's<00:03:39.209> actually<00:03:39.329> plugged

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
microphone ticky it's actually plugged

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.569 
microphone ticky it's actually plugged
into<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.139> side<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.560> laptop<00:03:40.919> here<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.370> you

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
into the side of the laptop here and you

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.879 
into the side of the laptop here and you
can<00:03:41.669> see<00:03:41.879> it<00:03:41.970> glowing<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.479> nice<00:03:42.659> blue<00:03:43.229> color<00:03:43.259> and

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
can see it glowing a nice blue color and

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.499 
can see it glowing a nice blue color and
that's<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.699> actually<00:03:44.819> picking<00:03:45.389> up

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
that's because it's actually picking up

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.960 
that's because it's actually picking up
audio<00:03:45.989> when<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.739> doesn't<00:03:46.979> pick<00:03:47.159> up<00:03:47.400> any<00:03:47.669> audio

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
audio when it doesn't pick up any audio

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.969 
audio when it doesn't pick up any audio
it's<00:03:48.180> got<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.389> added<00:03:48.569> benefit<00:03:49.109> they<00:03:49.439> actually

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
it's got the added benefit they actually

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.939 
it's got the added benefit they actually

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
mute the microphone set should result in

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.759 
mute the microphone set should result in
a<00:03:53.040> nice<00:03:53.250> sort<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.609> silent<00:03:54.590> portion<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
a nice sort of silent portion of the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.259 
a nice sort of silent portion of the
video<00:03:56.009> if<00:03:56.189> it's<00:03:56.310> not<00:03:56.519> actually<00:03:56.819> picking<00:03:57.150> up

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
video if it's not actually picking up

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.539 
video if it's not actually picking up
anything<00:03:57.509> and<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.259> LED<00:03:58.530> actually<00:03:59.069> changes

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
anything and the LED actually changes

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.199 
anything and the LED actually changes
from<00:03:59.909> blue<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.389> orange<00:04:04.400> there<00:04:05.400> we<00:04:05.609> go<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.849> saw

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
from blue to orange there we go you saw

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.610 
from blue to orange there we go you saw
it<00:04:06.329> change<00:04:06.569> from<00:04:06.750> blue<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.959> orange<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.500> that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
it change from blue to orange and that

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.649 
it change from blue to orange and that
meant<00:04:07.979> that<00:04:08.039> it<00:04:08.189> was<00:04:08.219> muted<00:04:08.759> it<00:04:09.239> turns<00:04:09.449> its

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
meant that it was muted it turns its

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.449 
meant that it was muted it turns its
nice<00:04:09.840> blue<00:04:10.139> color<00:04:10.169> once<00:04:10.799> it's<00:04:11.009> picking<00:04:11.340> up

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
nice blue color once it's picking up

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.300 
nice blue color once it's picking up
audio<00:04:11.939> again<00:04:12.150> now<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.169> quite<00:04:13.500> sensitive<00:04:13.829> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
audio again now is quite sensitive to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.310 
audio again now is quite sensitive to
distance<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.329> see<00:04:15.389> here<00:04:15.750> are<00:04:15.840> quite

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
distance you can see here are quite

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.490 
distance you can see here are quite
close<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:17.070> where<00:04:17.310> my<00:04:17.759> sore<00:04:18.389> mouth<00:04:18.599> is<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.289> I

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
close to where my sore mouth is if I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.129 
close to where my sore mouth is if I
move<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.949> further<00:04:20.159> away<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:21.449> very<00:04:21.900> very

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
move it further away is very very

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.439 
move it further away is very very
sensitive<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.889> you're<00:04:23.039> here<00:04:23.340> real<00:04:23.760> dip<00:04:24.180> in

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
sensitive so you're here real dip in

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.610 
sensitive so you're here real dip in
audio<00:04:25.050> levels

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
audio levels

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.350 
audio levels
now<00:04:26.130> I'm<00:04:26.340> not<00:04:26.520> sure<00:04:26.729> if<00:04:26.850> that's<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.120> good<00:04:27.300> thing

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
now I'm not sure if that's a good thing

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.030 
now I'm not sure if that's a good thing
maybe<00:04:27.750> it's<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.050> little<00:04:28.169> bit<00:04:28.350> too<00:04:28.590> sensitive

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
maybe it's a little bit too sensitive

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.250 
maybe it's a little bit too sensitive
but<00:04:29.639> certainly<00:04:29.940> from<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.360> distance<00:04:30.840> or<00:04:31.050> if<00:04:31.169> I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
but certainly from this distance or if I

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.110 
but certainly from this distance or if I
had<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.500> sitting<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:32.010> desk<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.910> does<00:04:33.090> a

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
had it sitting on a desk it does a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.969 
had it sitting on a desk it does a
really<00:04:33.210> good<00:04:33.720> job<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:34.020> picking<00:04:34.320> up<00:04:34.530> some<00:04:34.740> nice

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
really good job of picking up some nice

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.520 
really good job of picking up some nice
clean<00:04:35.460> audio<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.900> let<00:04:37.050> me<00:04:37.169> know<00:04:37.260> what<00:04:37.290> you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
clean audio so let me know what you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.230 
clean audio so let me know what you
think<00:04:37.770> do<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.070> think<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.400> blue<00:04:38.610> microphone

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
think do you think the blue microphone

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.060 
think do you think the blue microphone
sticky<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.900> big<00:04:40.199> improvement<00:04:40.350> over<00:04:40.860> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
sticky is a big improvement over the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.040 
sticky is a big improvement over the
built-in<00:04:41.580> microphone<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.540> macbook<00:04:42.720> air

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
built-in microphone on the macbook air

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.050 
built-in microphone on the macbook air
