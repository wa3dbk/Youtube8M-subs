protective information security or what

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.060 
protective information security or what
they<00:02:46.670> call<00:02:46.700> defensive<00:02:47.480> information<00:02:48.110> warfare

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
they call defensive information warfare

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.250 
they call defensive information warfare
operations<00:02:49.570> what's<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.750> difference<00:02:51.140> between

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
operations what's the difference between

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.070 
operations what's the difference between
that<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.010> offensive<00:02:52.900> information<00:02:53.900> warfare

this<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.630> both<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.140> two-pronged<00:03:12.650> operation

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
this is both a two-pronged operation

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.500
