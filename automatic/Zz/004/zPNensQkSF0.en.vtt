00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
to ten years though well you need to get
most<00:00:56.579> safety<00:00:57.030> features<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> know

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
most safety features out of it you know

features<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:06.000> new<00:01:06.150> car<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.510> more<00:01:06.689> likely<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
features also new car is more likely to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740 
features also new car is more likely to
be<00:01:07.229> reliable<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.670> buy<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.210> new<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.570> don't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
be reliable you buy it new you don't

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.620 
be reliable you buy it new you don't
inherit<00:01:10.140> problems<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:10.680> previous<00:01:11.070> owners

inherit problems from previous owners

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.090 
inherit problems from previous owners
and<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> treat<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.770> gonna<00:01:13.979> be

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and if you treat it right it's gonna be

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.340 
and if you treat it right it's gonna be
it's<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.670> continue<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.450> reliable<00:01:16.049> all

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it's gonna continue to be reliable all

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.960 
it's gonna continue to be reliable all
right

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
right

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.370 
right
financing<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.540> aggressive<00:01:18.630> with

financing is also more aggressive with
new<00:01:19.590> cars<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.580> example<00:01:21.000> financing<00:01:21.869> could

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
new cars so for example financing could

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
new cars so for example financing could
be<00:01:22.189> like<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.430> new<00:01:23.640> car<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> bought<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
be like my new car when I bought it I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
be like my new car when I bought it I
got<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> bought<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:27.060> percent

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
got I bought it about one one percent
financing<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:28.920> pretty<00:01:29.070> impressive

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

leased<00:04:16.470> cars<00:04:16.770> at<00:04:16.950> all<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.520> that's<00:04:17.760> really<00:04:17.970> cool

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
leased cars at all so that's really cool

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.050 
leased cars at all so that's really cool
too<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.140> if<00:04:19.620> you're<00:04:19.770> bad<00:04:19.890> maintenance<00:04:20.400> they

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
too so if you're bad maintenance they

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.990 
too so if you're bad maintenance they
handle<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.780> for<00:04:21.960> you<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.520> this<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.820> back

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
handle it for you and this is the back

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.340 
handle it for you and this is the back
this<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.330> why<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.540> think<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.900> lot<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.050> people<00:04:25.260> get

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
this is why I think a lot of people get

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.379 
this is why I think a lot of people get
new<00:04:25.470> cars<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:26.340> get<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> new<00:04:26.610> car<00:04:26.820> every<00:04:26.850> three

five<00:04:27.479> years<00:04:27.719> and<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.930> course<00:04:28.139> with<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.620> three

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
five years and of course with that three

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.800 
five years and of course with that three

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
run and why is that you you just told me

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.499 
run and why is that you you just told me
that<00:04:52.379> my<00:04:52.860> payments<00:04:53.610> are<00:04:53.699> smaller<00:04:53.969> but<00:04:54.180> yes

your<00:04:54.719> payments<00:04:55.080> are<00:04:55.169> smaller<00:04:55.499> and<00:04:55.620> fun<00:04:55.800> but

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
your payments are smaller and fun but

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.459 
your payments are smaller and fun but
because<00:04:56.400> one<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:57.419> don't<00:04:57.539> build<00:04:57.749> equity<00:04:58.259> and

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
because one you don't build equity and

it's more expensive because the
depreciation<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:09.930> we<00:05:10.349> talked<00:05:10.560> about<00:05:10.710> when<00:05:10.919> you

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
depreciation so we talked about when you

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.800 
depreciation so we talked about when you
took<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.460> new<00:05:11.639> car<00:05:11.879> and<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.389> drove<00:05:12.569> it<00:05:12.719> off

took a new car and you drove it off

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.749 
took a new car and you drove it off
lightly<00:05:13.080> depreciated<00:05:13.919> it's<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.400> same<00:05:14.580> thing

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
lightly depreciated it's the same thing

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.550 
lightly depreciated it's the same thing
with<00:05:14.879> at<00:05:15.029> least<00:05:15.150> there's<00:05:15.539> depreciation<00:05:16.439> of
