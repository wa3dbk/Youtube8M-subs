00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
really confirmed the model number I

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.910 
really confirmed the model number I
suspect<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> CB<00:00:14.790> 50<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:16.049> there's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> stamp

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
suspect it's a CB 50 but there's a stamp

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.760 
suspect it's a CB 50 but there's a stamp
on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> frame<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> says<00:00:17.970> s<00:00:18.150> S<00:00:18.570> 50<00:00:19.020> but

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
on the frame that says s S 50 but

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.700 
on the frame that says s S 50 but
whatever<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.029> real<00:00:21.210> vintage<00:00:21.689> Honda<00:00:21.930> from

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
whatever it's a real vintage Honda from

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250 
whatever it's a real vintage Honda from
1967<00:00:23.519> here<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:23.939> Vietnam<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.050> imagine

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
1967 here in Vietnam so we can imagine

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.810 
1967 here in Vietnam so we can imagine
that<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> probably<00:00:25.830> came<00:00:26.279> here<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> guess

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that it probably came here I guess

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.689 
that it probably came here I guess
during<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> Vietnam<00:00:27.570> War<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.490> still

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
during the Vietnam War and it's still

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
during the Vietnam War and it's still
maintained<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> very<00:00:30.750> nice<00:00:30.900> condition

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
maintained in a very nice condition

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.910 
maintained in a very nice condition
considering<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.520> old<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.590> let's<00:00:34.590> start

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
considering how old it is let's start

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.990 
considering how old it is let's start
from<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> back<00:00:35.489> shall<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.829> we<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> brake

lights and turn indicators and nice
condition<00:00:41.280> probably<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.059> original<00:00:46.190> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
condition probably not original and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
condition probably not original and
