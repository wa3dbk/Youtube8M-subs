00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.120
 finally free in their city they reserved their place weeks to 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.159

 there he annexed to the polls 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650
 for enthusiasts or his own because I love 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.870
 I love and I just film them 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.070
 Why 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.539
 but if the body 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.559
 at least two years 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.530
 we can find children under the arm in this economic context 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.820
 difficult more 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.430
 For years, it has linked the city hall and the cultural authorities 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.879
 laughter to continue before these figures indicated that m 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.309

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.399
 levels of the population and that paris laughs we manage to overcome 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.820
 many difficulties 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.610
 and when we address this issue of social difficulties of romilly 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.500
 the artist and his audience and that his show is made to laugh 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.579
 this reason for the crisis to talk about our army 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 children under one year old the Bavarian giant even managed to arrive 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.760
 the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.740
 similar in 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.280
 the fights 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.010
 during a meeting 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.640
 3 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.130
 crisis 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.500
 luxury is in this tax obviously 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.560
 because I wanted this show to be 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.450
 open to others 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 so I talk about all this and I pray with all that

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.300

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.700
 more artists perform 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.790
