00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.339
 the hare and the turtle 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.580
 the hare always laughed at the turtle 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.740
 because it was very slow 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 I do not really know why you bother 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.910
 move told 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:22.169
 good replied the turtle is true that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.470
 I'm slow but I always get to the end 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.789
 if you want we make a career 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.190
 you must be kidding said the hare 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.160
 but if you insist, I have no problem 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.650
 in doing a demonstration 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.680
 It was a hot sunny day and all the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.250
 animals went to see the great race the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.470
 mole raised the flag and said one two 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.990
 three already 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.430
 the hare ran out and the turtle 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.610
 was left behind 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.550
 coughing in a cloud of dust 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.620
 When the hare started walking , 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.260
 I had lost sight of 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.110
 they have nothing to do said the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.110
 grasshopper the turtle is lost 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.590
 that stupid turtle thought the hare 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.570
 turning around so that I will run better 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.330
 I rest for a while 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.850
 so he lay down in the sun and stayed 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.420
 asleep dreaming about the awards and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 medals he was going to get 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.550
 the turtle followed all morning 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.690
 moving very slowly 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.180
 most bored animals are 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.630
 They went home 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.570
 but the turtle continues to move forward 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.870
 at noon he passed by the hare that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.930
 I was sleeping by the side of the road 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.090
 she followed step by step 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.940
 finally the hare woke up and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.120
 stretched out the legs the sun was 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.120
 putting I look back and laughed 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.289
 No sign of that stupid turtle with a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.060
 big jump comes running in the direction of 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.060
 the goal to collect your prize 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.170
 but what was his mistake to see from 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.810
 away as the turtle had 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.730
 ahead and crawled on the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.330
 goal line 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 I had won the turtle 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.830
 from the top of the hill the hare 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.580
 I could hear the acclamations and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.150
 applause 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.700
 it's not fair ape the hare you made 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.700
 trap everyone knows that I run more 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.140
 that you 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.470
 said the turtle turning to look at her 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.190
 I already told you that I always arrive slowly 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.190
 but sure
