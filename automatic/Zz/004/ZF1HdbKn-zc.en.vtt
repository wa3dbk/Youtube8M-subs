here<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> lot<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> stuff<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.759> already<00:01:53.880> had

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
here so a lot of the stuff I already had

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.209 
here so a lot of the stuff I already had
I<00:01:54.210> saved<00:01:54.600> money<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> simple

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I saved money with just a simple

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.630 
I saved money with just a simple
transition<00:01:56.759> off<00:01:57.090> from<00:01:57.920> playing<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.070> console

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
transition off from playing on console

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
transition off from playing on console
to<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.299> pc<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> saved<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.439> decent<00:02:01.740> amount<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
to the pc so I saved a decent amount of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
to the pc so I saved a decent amount of
money<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:03.450> yeah<00:02:03.540> once<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.899> up<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
money there but yeah once it's up and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
money there but yeah once it's up and
running<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.530> been<00:02:04.680> flying<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.189> GTX<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
running it's been flying with GTX is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.050 
running it's been flying with GTX is
amazing<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.509> said<00:02:07.789> but<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.910> you'll

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
amazing like I just said but as you'll

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.699 
amazing like I just said but as you'll
notice<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.569> lot<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> times<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.619> was

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
notice a lot of the times like I was

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.500 
notice a lot of the times like I was
saying<00:02:10.890> again<00:02:11.129> earlier<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.030> am<00:02:12.270> making

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
saying again earlier is that I am making

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.070 
saying again earlier is that I am making
quite

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
quite

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
quite
mistake<00:02:13.440> still<00:02:13.740> in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> aim<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.100> nowhere<00:02:14.790> near

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
mistake still in the aim is nowhere near

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.040 
mistake still in the aim is nowhere near
what<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.390> should<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.410> yet<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.850> my<00:02:18.030> goal<00:02:18.330> now<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
what it should be yet but my goal now is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.150 
what it should be yet but my goal now is
to<00:02:19.650> obviously<00:02:19.970> people<00:02:20.970> working<00:02:21.390> at<00:02:21.480> this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
to obviously people working at this

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.100 
to obviously people working at this
maybe<00:02:23.160> tinker<00:02:23.550> around<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:24.030> some<00:02:24.390> rent<00:02:24.630> with

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
maybe tinker around with some rent with

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.140 
maybe tinker around with some rent with
the<00:02:25.140> render<00:02:25.560> settings<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:26.040> well<00:02:26.220> tinker

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the render settings as well tinker

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.020 
the render settings as well tinker
around<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.950> sensitivity<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.820> mouse

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
around with the sensitivity on the mouse

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.500 
around with the sensitivity on the mouse
maybe<00:02:30.960> some<00:02:31.230> P<00:02:31.410> mappings<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:33.060> keyboard

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
maybe some P mappings on the keyboard

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.810 
maybe some P mappings on the keyboard
but<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:34.020> now<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:34.350> pretty<00:02:34.680> good<00:02:34.860> I've<00:02:35.610> been

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
but for now it's pretty good I've been

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.730 
but for now it's pretty good I've been
able<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.090> train<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.630> sensitivity<00:02:37.260> I'm<00:02:37.500> using

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
able to train this sensitivity I'm using

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.280 
able to train this sensitivity I'm using
here<00:02:38.070> which<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.910> spits<00:02:39.270> well<00:02:39.540> next<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.080> none

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
here which is it spits well next to none

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.710 
here which is it spits well next to none
it's<00:02:40.650> maybe<00:02:41.250> an<00:02:41.490> eighth<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.270> actual

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
it's maybe an eighth of the actual

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.680 
it's maybe an eighth of the actual
sensitivity<00:02:43.620> bar<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.640> pretty<00:02:45.240> much<00:02:45.480> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
sensitivity bar is pretty much that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.570 
sensitivity bar is pretty much that
comfort<00:02:46.140> level<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.500> had<00:02:46.680> pretty<00:02:46.950> similar<00:02:47.430> with

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
comfort level I had pretty similar with

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.190 
comfort level I had pretty similar with
console<00:02:48.090> where<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.480> transition<00:02:48.840> between

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
console where I can transition between

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.510 
console where I can transition between

sniping assault rifles n machines and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.310 
sniping assault rifles n machines and
not<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.209> change<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> sensitivity<00:02:54.840> all

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
not have to change the sensitivity all

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.980 
not have to change the sensitivity all
and<00:02:55.530> still<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.860> quite<00:02:56.040> effective<00:02:56.600> but<00:02:57.600> again

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and still be quite effective but again

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.560 
and still be quite effective but again
it's<00:02:58.170> new<00:02:58.350> i'm<00:02:58.530> still<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:59.700> still<00:02:59.880> messing

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
it's new i'm still I'm still messing

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.880 
it's new i'm still I'm still messing
around<00:03:00.660> with<00:03:00.930> everything<00:03:01.260> trying<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> fix<00:03:01.709> it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
around with everything trying to fix it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.449

to optimum comfort level sniping I've

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.850 
to optimum comfort level sniping I've
noticed<00:03:05.820> playing<00:03:06.240> on<00:03:06.510> PC<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.170> definitely<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
noticed playing on PC is definitely a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.210 
noticed playing on PC is definitely a
different<00:03:08.459> beast<00:03:09.770> sensitivity<00:03:10.770> basically

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
different beast sensitivity basically

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.180 
different beast sensitivity basically
destroys<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:12.209> lot<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.290> your<00:03:13.440> accurate<00:03:13.890> shots

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
destroys a lot of your accurate shots

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.490 
destroys a lot of your accurate shots
like<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.300> lot<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.600> time<00:03:15.780> sometimes<00:03:16.050> but

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
like a lot of the time sometimes but

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.560 
like a lot of the time sometimes but
especially<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:17.010> you're<00:03:17.100> playing<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.489> 48<00:03:17.850> or<00:03:17.940> 64

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570

man servers because a lot of the time
well<00:03:22.320> it's<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.620> simple<00:03:22.890> math<00:03:23.040> if<00:03:23.370> you're

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
well it's just simple math if you're

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.420 
well it's just simple math if you're
aiming<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.239> or<00:03:24.360> two<00:03:24.390> guys<00:03:24.630> down<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.140> field

aiming at one or two guys down the field

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.820 
aiming at one or two guys down the field
two<00:03:26.430> guys<00:03:26.670> even<00:03:27.360> one<00:03:27.720> guy<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.560> can

two guys even one guy that you can

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.440 
two guys even one guy that you can

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
account for in save vs. it's 32 it's 32

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.060 
account for in save vs. it's 32 it's 32
people<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.930> have<00:03:34.080> now<00:03:34.290> have<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.650> account<00:03:34.920> for

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
people you have now have to account for

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.380 
people you have now have to account for
instead<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.580> 12<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.330> if<00:03:37.019> anyone<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:38.160> that

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
instead of 12 and if anyone of that

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.330 
instead of 12 and if anyone of that
difference<00:03:39.440> happens<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.620> shoot<00:03:40.830> at<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.190> as

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
difference happens to shoot at you as

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.970 
difference happens to shoot at you as
you're<00:03:41.489> shooting<00:03:41.760> your<00:03:42.450> shots<00:03:42.720> off<00:03:42.930> simple<00:03:43.890> as

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
you're shooting your shots off simple as

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.970 
you're shooting your shots off simple as
that<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.880> it's<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.269> definitely<00:03:45.840> about

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
that so it's it's definitely about

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.280

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
2.5 or so it's the frame rates it it's

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.029 
2.5 or so it's the frame rates it it's
the<00:05:21.120> difference<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:22.050> staggering<00:05:22.680> you

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
the difference is staggering you

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.129 
the difference is staggering you
actually<00:05:23.880> win<00:05:24.060> gunfights<00:05:24.600> you're<00:05:24.810> supposed

to<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:26.250> can<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.699> range<00:05:27.000> at<00:05:27.210> which<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.539> can

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
to you can the range at which you can

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.810 
to you can the range at which you can
see<00:05:27.750> people<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.500> target<00:05:28.830> them<00:05:28.949> as<00:05:29.100> threats<00:05:29.490> is

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
see people and target them as threats is

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.560 
see people and target them as threats is
incredible<00:05:30.800> it's<00:05:31.800> it's<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.700> very<00:05:32.789> large

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
incredible it's it's a very large

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.570 
incredible it's it's a very large
difference<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.320> definitely<00:05:35.039> recommend

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
difference so I definitely recommend

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.450 
difference so I definitely recommend
