when<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.370> really<00:04:53.610> think<00:04:53.640> about<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.060> because

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
when you really think about it because

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.330

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
of everything else going on the car I

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.760 
of everything else going on the car I
think<00:04:56.850> this<00:04:56.940> magic<00:04:57.360> might<00:04:58.080> just<00:04:58.320> drag<00:04:58.560> on<00:04:58.740> a

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
think this magic might just drag on a

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.170 
think this magic might just drag on a
little<00:04:59.070> too<00:04:59.220> long<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.670> it's<00:04:59.760> going<00:04:59.850> to<00:04:59.910> end<00:05:00.060> up

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
little too long and it's going to end up

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.760 
little too long and it's going to end up
feeling<00:05:00.540> like<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:01.200> know<00:05:01.290> a<00:05:01.320> little<00:05:01.560> bit<00:05:01.680> of

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
feeling like you know a little bit of

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.110 
feeling like you know a little bit of
time<00:05:01.980> filter<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:02.640> um<00:05:03.920> um<00:05:04.920> nothing<00:05:05.670> i'm<00:05:05.910> still
