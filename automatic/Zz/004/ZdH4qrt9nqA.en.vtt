00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.450
 let's make him the voice of the lover of 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.459
 bricks as it was already in we are a 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.290
 we put it in the crochet and the 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.410
 let's go through one of the 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.690
 terminations of whole points 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.720
 we make a chain and start here 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.980
 half point 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.460
 one two three four chains and we're going 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.460
 to go 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.500
 the next whole point ending 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 1 2 3 4 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 to the base and so we will continue 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.980
 1 2 3 4 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.800
 always in these little heads 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.800
 where where ending this whole point 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.410
 why for what number 12 is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.410
 stable 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.360
 number 2 does not leave the point because 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.840
 if we do it here this point 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.670
 always going to tend to pull and we're going 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.680
 to make the edge ugly and it's just what 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.600
 we do not want and if they realize the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.540
 Little chains are making small 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.790
 probes that also helps us to give 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.000
 flight to our voice 1 2 3 4 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.580
 we will end like this only in the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.800
 tips we are going to make a change 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.710
 so that the tip is straight and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.620
 do not pull us we have to have a lot 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.090
 Be careful when working there 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.090
 and now let's get to our tip 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 3/4 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.119
 1 2 3 4 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.930
 notice that I'm up and hopefully I have 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.650
 much more stable the union of my environment 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.530
 points 2 3 4 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.200
 and we can also pass a ribbon on 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.790
 the first chain of the first row 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.800
 of chains 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.450
 we could also pass a ribbon 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.970
 possible we want to make some ornament 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.800
 additional which I really would not 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.110
 and only this voice would work in 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.630
 white because how nice of this blanket is 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.460
 the work that in the blanket the forest 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.490
 it has to be something very simple and 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.340
 delicate so that it does not take away thanks to 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.960
 our blanket ok and we are already arriving 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.590
 to the point 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.120
 2 3 4 look at how we're going to work in the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.980
 tips 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.180
 in the one of the tip in the last whole what 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 What happens is that here is a little 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.970
 difficult because we are working on 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 chain stitch 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.100
 we could save ourselves the work and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.550
 do it within the half point of your 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.710
 mind 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:48.220
 let's start 1 2 3 4 and in the same 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.190
 place where we are going to do 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.210
 again our half point so that 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.070
 there we stay at the center we have a 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.110
 arito in the center and this milestone you see 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.650
 growing on top of each other like 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.340
 we work here two three 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.830
 4 how we work here 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.680
 if there are accounts here there are one and two 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.709
 chains not then here we are going to leave 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.680
 12 and we're going to work on doing 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.959
 points 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 ok what we could do that too 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.319
 it will be nice to us instead of 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.480
 work within the point we can 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.250
 work between the two points then 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.310
 only in the first one we are going to use the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.329
 point center we skip one in that 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.650
 case and we make our half point one 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:42.209
 two three four and now let's jump 1 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.370
 2 and between 2 and 3 we are going to do 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.319
 our half point 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.930
 1 2 3 4 between 2 and 3 we do 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.459
 our half point and so we are going to 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.200
 work all this row until you get to 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.959
 the next point the next point 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.790
 we have to work just like we have 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.700
 worked the first all our 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.470
 tips we will work like I will 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.790
 move a little more to be able to 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.810
 show how we are going to do the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.810
 following rows 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.280
 1 2 3 4 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.280
 okay 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.650
 We finished the whole round and came back 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.650
 to see how we do the little tip
