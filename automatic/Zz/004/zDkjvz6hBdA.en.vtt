00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
being throwing a proxy down is the fact

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
being throwing a proxy down is the fact
that<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.220> nothing<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.060> base<00:01:27.540> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that you have nothing in your base so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.469 
that you have nothing in your base so
it's<00:01:28.259> left<00:01:28.650> completely<00:01:29.100> open<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> attack<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it's left completely open to attack and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's left completely open to attack and
that<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> should<00:01:31.950> keep<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.549> mind<00:01:32.610> if

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that is what you should keep in mind if

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.719 
that is what you should keep in mind if
you<00:01:33.210> are<00:01:33.360> being<00:01:33.570> proxied<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.979> I'm

doing this I did throw down in a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.630 
doing this I did throw down in a
simulator<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.349> then<00:02:15.560> quickly<00:02:15.830> cancelled<00:02:16.220> it

of just keep reinforcing this it was a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.699 
of just keep reinforcing this it was a
bit<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.720> waste<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.140> wouldn't<00:02:21.380> have<00:02:21.470> been<00:02:21.590> able

another gate up which I'm not so sure is

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.920 
another gate up which I'm not so sure is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
efficient he shouldn't be I don't

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.300

push<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:28.489> here<00:03:28.880> he<00:03:29.000> comes<00:03:29.180> again<00:03:29.299> with<00:03:29.600> this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
push so here he comes again with this

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.509 
push so here he comes again with this
push<00:03:29.930> but<00:03:30.170> he<00:03:30.350> isn't<00:03:30.650> actually<00:03:30.769> attacking<00:03:31.250> my

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
push but he isn't actually attacking my

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.940 
push but he isn't actually attacking my
units<00:03:32.180> he's<00:03:32.359> moving<00:03:32.810> them<00:03:32.959> past<00:03:33.260> try<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:33.829> get

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
units he's moving them past try and get

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.129 
units he's moving them past try and get
away<00:03:34.010> from<00:03:34.130> my<00:03:34.489> cannons<00:03:34.880> this<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> really

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
away from my cannons this is a really

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.830 
away from my cannons this is a really
bad<00:03:36.170> idea<00:03:36.350> from<00:03:36.889> him<00:03:37.130> he's<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.489> losing<00:03:38.389> units

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
bad idea from him he's just losing units

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.569 
bad idea from him he's just losing units
again<00:03:39.200> again<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.829> should<00:03:40.040> have<00:03:40.130> moved<00:03:40.340> that

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
again again I should have moved that

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.670 
again again I should have moved that
zellerbach<00:03:41.090> about<00:03:41.329> point<00:03:41.600> save<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.319> but

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
zellerbach about point save it but

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.979 
zellerbach about point save it but
didn't<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.220> bit<00:03:43.549> bit<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.120> mismanagement<00:03:44.630> there

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
didn't a bit bit of mismanagement there

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.110 
didn't a bit bit of mismanagement there
and<00:03:45.200> now<00:03:45.739> he's<00:03:45.980> throwing<00:03:46.280> down<00:03:46.609> pylons

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and now he's throwing down pylons

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.910 
and now he's throwing down pylons
because<00:03:47.420> he<00:03:47.510> has<00:03:47.720> thrown<00:03:47.989> this<00:03:48.109> Forge<00:03:48.440> up<00:03:48.709> here

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
because he has thrown this Forge up here

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.979 
because he has thrown this Forge up here
he's<00:03:49.130> trying<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.549> get<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> few<00:03:50.090> cannons<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.750> but

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
he's trying to get a few cannons up but

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.750

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
minerals had about 500 in the bank there

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.490 
minerals had about 500 in the bank there
which<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.050> no<00:04:22.290> good<00:04:22.320> at<00:04:23.190> all<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:24.600> again<00:04:24.780> got

zealots here and to make a push but it's

zealots here and to make a push but it's
not<00:04:32.430> going<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.820> work<00:04:33.440> done<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.470> few<00:04:34.680> pylons<00:04:35.130> to

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
not going to work done a few pylons to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.240 
not going to work done a few pylons to
get<00:04:35.460> myself<00:04:35.580> some<00:04:36.060> more<00:04:36.090> units<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.170> at<00:04:38.010> this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
get myself some more units and at this

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.880 
get myself some more units and at this
point<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:39.180> didn't<00:04:40.170> know<00:04:40.260> what<00:04:40.380> he<00:04:40.500> was<00:04:40.590> doing

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
point I didn't know what he was doing

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.880 
point I didn't know what he was doing
what<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.610> assumed<00:04:42.150> he<00:04:42.360> was<00:04:42.590> massing<00:04:43.590> some

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
what I I assumed he was massing some

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.770 
what I I assumed he was massing some
zealots<00:04:44.130> down<00:04:44.430> here<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.060> threw<00:04:45.420> down<00:04:45.570> two

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
zealots down here so I threw down two

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.280 
zealots down here so I threw down two
more<00:04:45.930> gates<00:04:46.230> at<00:04:46.770> two<00:04:47.280> more<00:04:47.520> cannons<00:04:48.060> and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
more gates at two more cannons and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.580 
more gates at two more cannons and
blocked<00:04:49.290> this<00:04:49.590> off<00:04:49.890> with<00:04:50.220> my<00:04:50.400> zealots<00:04:50.850> and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
blocked this off with my zealots and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.070 
blocked this off with my zealots and
also<00:04:52.590> sent<00:04:52.890> these<00:04:53.100> five<00:04:53.370> sets<00:04:53.790> up<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.600> his<00:04:54.780> base

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
also sent these five sets up to his base

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.050 
also sent these five sets up to his base
which<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.620> assumed<00:04:56.280> would<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.610> completely

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
which I assumed would be completely

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.760 
which I assumed would be completely
unprotected<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.830> seems<00:04:59.220> as<00:04:59.430> if<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.700> was<00:05:00.770> so

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
unprotected and it seems as if it was so

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.950 
unprotected and it seems as if it was so
he's<00:05:02.010> just<00:05:02.040> messing<00:05:02.370> up<00:05:02.700> here<00:05:02.940> he's<00:05:03.480> probably

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
he's just messing up here he's probably

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.600 
he's just messing up here he's probably
going<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.380> push<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.710> here<00:05:04.920> quite<00:05:05.160> soon<00:05:05.370> and

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
going to push in here quite soon and

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.050 
going to push in here quite soon and
realize<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.150> can't<00:05:06.420> do<00:05:06.570> very<00:05:06.750> much

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
realize that you can't do very much

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.460 
realize that you can't do very much
boosting<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.150> few<00:05:09.450> miles<00:05:09.630> else<00:05:09.870> as<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.200> can<00:05:10.350> see

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
boosting a few miles else as you can see

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.720 
boosting a few miles else as you can see
but<00:05:13.470> at<00:05:13.590> this<00:05:13.710> point<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.220> game<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.550> pretty

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
but at this point the game is pretty

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.580 
but at this point the game is pretty
much<00:05:14.940> one<00:05:15.240> these<00:05:15.600> zealots<00:05:15.900> are<00:05:16.230> going<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.500> go

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
much one these zealots are going to go

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.800 
much one these zealots are going to go
into<00:05:16.740> his<00:05:16.920> base<00:05:17.130> take<00:05:18.060> out<00:05:18.210> his<00:05:18.270> mineral<00:05:18.600> line

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
into his base take out his mineral line
