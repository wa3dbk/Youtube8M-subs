what<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.300> don't<00:00:52.480> see<00:00:52.660> on<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.840> screen<00:00:53.170> is<00:00:53.440> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
what you don't see on the screen is the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.639 
what you don't see on the screen is the
synthetic<00:00:54.820> vision<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.660> it's<00:00:56.230> just<00:00:56.500> not

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
synthetic vision and it's just not

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
synthetic vision and it's just not
booted<00:00:57.010> up<00:00:57.129> yet<00:00:57.370> takes<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.820> few<00:00:58.000> minutes

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
booted up yet takes it a few minutes

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.910 
booted up yet takes it a few minutes
actually<00:00:59.230> I<00:00:59.289> believe<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.559> have<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.769> have<00:00:59.890> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
actually I believe you have to have a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.160 
actually I believe you have to have a
GPS<00:01:00.399> signal<00:01:00.670> before<00:01:01.090> it<00:01:01.180> before<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:01.780> comes<00:01:01.930> on

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
GPS signal before it before it comes on

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.150 
GPS signal before it before it comes on
but<00:01:02.320> anyway<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:03.190> synthetic<00:01:03.910> vision<00:01:04.110> actually

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
but anyway the synthetic vision actually

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.810 
but anyway the synthetic vision actually
paints<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.960> terrain<00:01:08.700> elevation<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
paints the terrain elevation the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.370 
paints the terrain elevation the
mountains<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.360> heels<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.869> sort<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.140> thing

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
mountains the heels that sort of thing

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.520 
mountains the heels that sort of thing
and<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:12.430> towers<00:01:12.970> all<00:01:13.299> out<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.869> screen<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
and the towers all out on the screen and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.039 
and the towers all out on the screen and
if<00:01:15.369> you<00:01:15.520> get<00:01:15.670> too<00:01:15.850> close<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.299> one<00:01:16.479> or<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.810> start

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
if you get too close to one or you start

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.359 
if you get too close to one or you start
to<00:01:17.170> send<00:01:17.439> in<00:01:17.560> too<00:01:17.710> rapidly

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
to send in too rapidly

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.480 
to send in too rapidly
a<00:01:18.520> voice<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.630> come<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.320> tell<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.189> that

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
a voice to come on and tell you that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.670 
a voice to come on and tell you that
you're<00:01:22.210> getting<00:01:22.420> near<00:01:22.689> terrain<00:01:23.020> or<00:01:23.320> there's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
you're getting near terrain or there's

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.069 
you're getting near terrain or there's
an<00:01:23.799> obstacle<00:01:24.070> or<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.579> sort<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.850> thing<00:01:25.079> also

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
an obstacle or that sort of thing also

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
on a synthetic vision display you will

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.859 
on a synthetic vision display you will
see<00:01:29.140> traffic<00:01:29.710> depicted<00:01:30.670> out<00:01:30.880> into<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.630> blue

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
see traffic depicted out into the blue

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.910 
see traffic depicted out into the blue
area<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.740> sky<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.990> general<00:01:35.409> position

area the sky in the general position

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.730 
area the sky in the general position
that<00:01:36.159> it's<00:01:36.700> suspected<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.450> be<00:01:37.479> we<00:01:38.439> had<00:01:38.590> the

that it's suspected to be we had the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.569 
that it's suspected to be we had the
Garmin<00:01:39.159> GTN<00:01:39.460> or<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.420> Garmin<00:01:41.189> let's<00:01:42.189> see<00:01:42.430> it's

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
Garmin GTN or the Garmin let's see it's

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.810 
Garmin GTN or the Garmin let's see it's
the<00:01:42.869> 820<00:01:44.040> traffic<00:01:45.040> system<00:01:45.399> put<00:01:45.549> it<00:01:45.670> in<00:01:45.729> it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
the 820 traffic system put it in it

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.719 
the 820 traffic system put it in it
detects<00:01:46.149> out<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.509> about<00:01:46.689> 12<00:01:46.990> miles<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.549> it's

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
detects out to about 12 miles so it's

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.080 
detects out to about 12 miles so it's
also<00:01:48.939> there<00:01:49.299> on<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.380> screen<00:01:50.680> next<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.310> you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
see them a little better but yeah it's a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.420 
see them a little better but yeah it's a
pretty<00:02:21.010> cool<00:02:21.250> little<00:02:21.520> little<00:02:21.970> unit<00:02:23.430> it

pretty cool little little unit it
there's<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:26.230> thing<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.010> flight

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
there's a little thing on the flight

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.410 
there's a little thing on the flight
display<00:02:28.500> called<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.620> velocity<00:02:30.280> vector<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
display called a velocity vector and it

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.480 
display called a velocity vector and it
actually<00:02:31.570> puts<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.050> little<00:02:32.170> green<00:02:32.590> circle<00:02:33.280> out

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
actually puts a little green circle out

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
approaches and do an instrument training

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.350 
approaches and do an instrument training
very<00:05:36.129> very<00:05:36.639> very<00:05:37.120> comfortable<00:05:37.539> and<00:05:39.150> easier<00:05:40.150> in

very very very comfortable and easier in
my<00:05:40.479> opinion<00:05:40.990> because<00:05:41.529> you<00:05:41.680> get<00:05:41.889> so<00:05:42.279> much<00:05:42.550> more

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819
