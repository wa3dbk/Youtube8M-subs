00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi, in response to many requests we'll repair today our Passat 35i

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.640
I'll show you how to replace the starter motor

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.280
For working at the starter you have always to disconnect the battery

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:25.640
Remove the cable and take care that it will not have accidently contact

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.760
At this engine the starter is located between the bell housing of the clutch and the fan

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
We'll start by removing all cables 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.360
The cable from the ignition starter lock is plugged here

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.280
Now the contact 50 is off

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.000
I remove also this plug from the gear box

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.840
Remove the cables from the holder clip

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.880
Below is a second cable

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:10.520
The part has been mounted in this direction

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.600
Remove the cap of contact 30

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.880
The starter is fixed by 2 very long bolts

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.560
But take care, the bolts doesn't end here!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.480
The bolts go through here and end in the front engine mount

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.360
Thus the have to support the engine when removing the bolts

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.560
Don't lift the engine, have just tension in the hangers

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.600
Remove the engine ground strap

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.720
For unlocking the bolts you'll need some tender force

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.080
The second bolts is below the starter

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:10.640
and finally the starter can be removed from the engine

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:20.120
For testing the starter, I fixed it in the vice

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.240
Contact 30 I connected to a thick cable directly, which I'll connect later to the plus pole of the battery

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.840
Further I make a connection between contact 50 and 30

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.600
For the ground I use also a thick cable, connected to the minus pole of the battery

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.160
You have seen the problem, the magnetic switch works, but the starter doesn't run at each trial

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.120
Maybe the carbon brushes are worn, or the rotor is worn. The starter is very cheap, thus I'll replace it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.640
When installing a new starter, this sleeve should be replaced, too

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.360
The sleeve is located behind the starter ring

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.480
For removing the sleeve, I'll drill a fitting screw tap in and I pull it out 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.000
With brute force it works

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.360
For mounting the new sleeve, I made a special tool on the lathe. Coat it with grease

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.840
Put grease on the starter sprocket and install the starter

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.680
If it enters in position, half job is done

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.880
Secure the starter with the upper bolt

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.720
If the engine hangs in correct position, the bolt will enter easily

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.280
Mount also the lower bolt

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.400
Fasten the bolts with 60 Nm

00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.280
and the same for the lower one

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.000
Mount the ground strap

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:20.080
Install all the cables

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.440
The big plus cable comes on the bolt here and then the thin cable

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.360
Mount the protection cap and the condom over the cable

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:43.240
Check all again - all is fine

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.600
All is working

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.760
The repair is done, the starter works

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.080
Bye, bye, see you in our next video
