the<00:00:03.659> concept<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.170> flipped<00:00:04.470> classroom<00:00:04.830> is

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
the concept of flipped classroom is

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.309 
the concept of flipped classroom is
pretty<00:00:05.100> simple<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.759> lecture<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.660> now<00:00:06.930> being

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
pretty simple the lecture is now being

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.770 
pretty simple the lecture is now being
uploaded<00:00:07.620> online<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> students<00:00:09.570> can

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
uploaded online so that the students can

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.930 
uploaded online so that the students can
watch<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.200> at<00:00:10.349> home<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.340> homework<00:00:11.759> that

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
watch it at home and the homework that

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.580 
watch it at home and the homework that
is<00:00:12.000> usually<00:00:12.269> done<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.870> home<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.230> now<00:00:13.380> being

now<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> challenges<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.410> flipping

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
now what are the challenges of flipping

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
now what are the challenges of flipping
the<00:00:29.250> classroom<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.449> them<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.750> course<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the classroom one of them of course is

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
now in flipping the classroom I only

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.220 
now in flipping the classroom I only
needed<00:03:43.310> some<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.819> these<00:03:44.269> materials<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.079> be

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
needed some of these materials to be

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.740 
needed some of these materials to be
able<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.799> make<00:03:45.980> this<00:03:46.099> possible<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:47.299> I'm<00:03:47.510> using

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
able to make this possible so I'm using

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.869 
able to make this possible so I'm using
the<00:03:48.019> camera<00:03:48.409> which<00:03:48.739> is<00:03:48.950> now<00:03:49.099> I'm<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.459> using

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
the camera which is now I'm just using

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.470 
the camera which is now I'm just using
my<00:03:50.709> built-in<00:03:51.709> video<00:03:52.430> camera<00:03:52.939> in<00:03:53.060> my<00:03:53.180> laptop

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
my built-in video camera in my laptop

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.199 
my built-in video camera in my laptop
and<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.409> is<00:03:54.590> what<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.799> use<00:03:55.129> in<00:03:55.400> recording<00:03:56.000> my

and that is what I use in recording my
video<00:03:56.510> lectures<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:58.459> also<00:03:58.790> use<00:03:59.150> some<00:03:59.419> loose

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
video lectures and I also use some loose

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.319 
video lectures and I also use some loose
boards<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.079> I<00:04:00.200> acquire<00:04:00.919> in<00:04:01.310> Home<00:04:01.639> Depot<00:04:02.120> and

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.720 
boards that I acquire in Home Depot and
this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.379> what<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.560> use<00:04:03.919> over<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:04.340> over<00:04:04.609> and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
this is what I use over and over and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.089 
this is what I use over and over and
over<00:04:04.849> again<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.810> be<00:04:06.019> able<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.500> produce<00:04:06.680> more

over again to be able to produce more

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.640 
over again to be able to produce more
