00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.110
 the training took place at quite 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.000
 difficult climatic conditions very 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.800
 the hot weather of the fish was long 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.420
 completely inactive so check 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.559
 potential points was very difficult plan i 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.120
 I think we'll discuss with Alexander in the evening 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.110
 Now it is difficult to guess something because 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.910
 that in those places where we caught there is 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.489
 those places that we hoped for 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.940
 but they did not work the ladies in some 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.730
 sense of 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.839
 Any bank game that is, for example, with us. 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.780
 which we closed at 7:45 am 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:08.890
 45 minutes after the start on it is not 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.890
 not a single fish was served 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.930
 Well, in general, we met with Oleg in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.810
 instagram strangely both of us 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.040
 rather actively use this 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.200
 social network we like 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.329
 take a picture of fishing there 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.420
 photos we somehow found each other 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.320
 as we went fishing in the fall here 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.179
 we were comfortable to catch a place 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.470
 we understood each other perfectly well 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.960
 and somehow we 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.820
 the friendship it set went further steel 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.950
 ride to train and 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.790
 and decided to act together on the shelf 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.790
 go for 1
