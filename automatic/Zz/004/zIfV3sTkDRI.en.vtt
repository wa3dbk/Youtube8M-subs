00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.400
 and then personal beauty that LÃ©o and today came 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 do you a tip of one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.469
 application to show that the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.809
 Dragon Ball app're a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.190
 official purpose but I was 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 looking for the apps and I'm done 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.560
 finding the one that this application does 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.039
 it shows up all but most of the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.019
 fights that will happen bring us good 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 our music but also in gt in exchange 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 a good first when the goal was 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.520
 child and such and for those who are fan of dragon 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 ball will fuck you 5 fuck you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.800
 I thought it was sensational, I saw the fight. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 how much does it google says 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 turns it into something crucial that it perceives 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.329
 inpe first time found it very epic're 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.870
 only problem would not be a problem but 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 is that the sun videos in English then 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 is not dubbed in Portuguese nor subtitled 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 but so to see if the good game does not 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.719
 Import yourself and enjoy it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.600
 ok and I recommend that you have a menu 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.280
 you can add your own videos 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 favorite songs 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.250
 here in this favorite menu that has the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.490
 fights application settings is well 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.729
 simple and actually pulls the videos 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.530
 but youtube is focused only has the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.340
 fights here and found it sensational good and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.890
 This is knowing that a fight for you 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.290
