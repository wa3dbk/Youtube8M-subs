00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
trying to focus on the littlest move to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.410 
trying to focus on the littlest move to
make

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.610 
that's the only move you can do if
you're<00:04:40.120> in<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> wheelchair<00:04:40.480> how<00:04:41.320> are<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.500> gonna

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
you're in a wheelchair how are you gonna

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.320 
you're in a wheelchair how are you gonna
make<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.860> one<00:04:42.190> arm<00:04:42.460> movement<00:04:42.970> look

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
make that one arm movement look

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.730
