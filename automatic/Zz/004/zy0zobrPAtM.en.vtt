upgrade our 68 Camaros front suspension
and<00:00:08.730> steering<00:00:08.760> but<00:00:09.750> we<00:00:09.900> weren't<00:00:10.080> finished

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and steering but we weren't finished

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.799 
and steering but we weren't finished
there<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.400> time<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.880> upgrade<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.570> rear

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
there now it's time to upgrade the rear

parts<00:00:15.420> from<00:00:15.540> detroit<00:00:15.900> speed<00:00:16.490> this<00:00:17.490> time<00:00:17.550> we're

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
parts from detroit speed this time we're

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
parts from detroit speed this time we're
going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.359> using<00:00:18.600> one<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> quadrant

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
going to be using one of the quadrant

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.090 
going to be using one of the quadrant
kits<00:00:20.160> which<00:00:20.939> replaces<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.779> Camaros<00:00:22.410> original

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
kits which replaces the Camaros original

leaf spring design with an articulating
four<00:00:27.300> link<00:00:27.660> system<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.920> allows<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.670> rear

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
four link system that allows this rear

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.220 
four link system that allows this rear
axle<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:31.040> rotate<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.340> pivot<00:00:32.820> smoothly<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
axle to rotate and pivot smoothly so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.430 
axle to rotate and pivot smoothly so
it's<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.590> predictable<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> race<00:00:35.730> track

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
it's more predictable on a race track

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.660 
it's more predictable on a race track
when<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> comes<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:37.920> types<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.430> rear

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
when it comes to these types of rear

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
when it comes to these types of rear
suspensions<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> think

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
suspensions I actually like to think

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
suspensions I actually like to think
about<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> backwards<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.090> mean<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> lot<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
about them the backwards I mean a lot of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.299 
about them the backwards I mean a lot of
times<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> hardware<00:00:44.010> involved

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
times you look at the hardware involved

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.540 
times you look at the hardware involved
and<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.289> leaf<00:00:46.500> spring<00:00:46.890> for

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and to think that the leaf spring for

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
and to think that the leaf spring for
the<00:00:47.940> four<00:00:48.180> link<00:00:48.390> arms<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.680> hold<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the four link arms are there to hold the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
the four link arms are there to hold the
rear<00:00:50.280> end<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> place<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.719> car<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:51.930> driving

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
rear end in place as the car is driving

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
rear end in place as the car is driving
but<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> opposite

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
but it's kind of actually the opposite

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.010 
but it's kind of actually the opposite
the<00:00:55.230> rear<00:00:55.469> axle<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> tire<00:00:56.719> are<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> only

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the rear axle and the tire are the only

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
the rear axle and the tire are the only
parts<00:00:58.320> touching<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> roadway<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> if<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
parts touching the roadway and if you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.810 
parts touching the roadway and if you
can<00:01:00.300> imagine<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.500> yourself<00:01:02.190> pushing<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
can imagine you know yourself pushing a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.289 
can imagine you know yourself pushing a
cart<00:01:03.120> around<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> shop<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> rear<00:01:05.820> axle<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
cart around the shop the rear axle and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
cart around the shop the rear axle and
wheels<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.080> similar<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.830> body<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
wheels would be similar to your body and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.149 
wheels would be similar to your body and
your<00:01:08.549> feet<00:01:08.790> pushing<00:01:09.450> forward<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.979> leaf

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
your feet pushing forward and the leaf

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
your feet pushing forward and the leaf
springs<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.060> control<00:01:12.420> arms<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:12.810> be

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
springs and the control arms would be

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.440 
springs and the control arms would be
your<00:01:13.080> arms<00:01:13.729> pushing<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> weight<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> car

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
your arms pushing the weight of the car

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
your arms pushing the weight of the car
so<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> force<00:01:17.130> that's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so there's really a lot of force that's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.270 
so there's really a lot of force that's
acted<00:01:17.880> upon<00:01:18.270> any<00:01:19.200> type<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.560> rear<00:01:19.830> control<00:01:20.250> arm

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
acted upon any type of rear control arm

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
acted upon any type of rear control arm
or<00:01:20.700> leaf<00:01:20.970> spring<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:22.229> happens<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
or leaf spring and what happens with the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.640 
or leaf spring and what happens with the
original<00:01:23.310> Camaros<00:01:23.850> leaf<00:01:24.060> springs<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:25.439> soon

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
original Camaros leaf springs is as soon

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.219 
original Camaros leaf springs is as soon
as<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> start<00:01:26.159> putting<00:01:26.369> bigger<00:01:26.850> power<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
as you start putting bigger power and a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.940 
as you start putting bigger power and a
stickier<00:01:28.950> tire<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.450> combination

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
stickier tire and using that combination

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
stickier tire and using that combination
those<00:01:31.950> Springs<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.640> designed<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> flex<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
those Springs are designed to flex I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.450 
those Springs are designed to flex I
mean<00:01:33.720> after<00:01:33.960> all<00:01:34.079> their<00:01:34.259> Springs<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.310> what

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
mean after all their Springs but what

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
mean after all their Springs but what
happens<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.570> what's<00:01:36.780> called<00:01:36.869> spring

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
happens is you get what's called spring

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
happens is you get what's called spring
wrap-up<00:01:37.890> where<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> tire<00:01:39.240> sticks<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.930> well

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
wrap-up where the tire sticks to well

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
wrap-up where the tire sticks to well
and<00:01:40.579> those<00:01:41.579> leaf<00:01:41.850> springs<00:01:42.210> flex<00:01:42.659> too<00:01:42.990> much<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and those leaf springs flex too much and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.260 
and those leaf springs flex too much and
the<00:01:44.460> whole<00:01:44.490> axle<00:01:45.060> housing<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> allowed

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
the whole axle housing is allowed

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.080 
the whole axle housing is allowed
and<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.570> twist<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.829> when<00:01:47.979> that<00:01:48.100> happens<00:01:48.549> you

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
and a twist and when that happens you

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.300 
and a twist and when that happens you
break<00:01:49.329> traction<00:01:49.630> break<00:01:50.530> traction<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:51.159> lose

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
break traction break traction you lose

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.109 
break traction break traction you lose
control

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
control

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.570 
control
so<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.869> Detroit<00:01:53.259> speed<00:01:53.560> Quadra<00:01:54.130> link<00:01:54.310> it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
so the Detroit speed Quadra link it

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.810 
so the Detroit speed Quadra link it
solves<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.540> by<00:01:55.810> providing<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:57.040> solid<00:01:57.340> link

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
solves this by providing a solid link

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.740 
solves this by providing a solid link
that<00:01:58.420> doesn't<00:01:59.080> flex<00:01:59.680> under<00:02:00.189> acceleration<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
that doesn't flex under acceleration the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.660

is to secure these pockets to the Camaro

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.770 
is to secure these pockets to the Camaro
floor<00:04:15.170> for<00:04:15.860> welding<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.489> in<00:04:17.000> our<00:04:17.120> case<00:04:17.360> we<00:04:17.750> use

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
floor for welding and in our case we use

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.630 
floor for welding and in our case we use
some<00:04:18.200> sheet<00:04:18.380> metal<00:04:18.650> screws<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.549> get

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
some sheet metal screws to get

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.490 
some sheet metal screws to get
everything<00:04:20.000> tight<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.570> floor<00:04:20.840> but

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
everything tight to the floor but

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.430 
everything tight to the floor but
fabricator<00:04:22.460> Nick<00:04:22.760> found<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.870> one<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.380> the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
fabricator Nick found that one of the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.230 
fabricator Nick found that one of the
parts<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.860> floor<00:04:25.160> didn't<00:04:25.640> quite<00:04:25.850> fit<00:04:26.090> as<00:04:26.210> well

parts the floor didn't quite fit as well
as<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.600> other<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:28.610> at<00:04:28.700> this<00:04:28.790> point<00:04:29.030> we've

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
as the other so at this point we've

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.940 
as the other so at this point we've
already<00:04:29.510> cut<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.170> holes<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.710> floor<00:04:30.830> for

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
the floor of the car so that when you go

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.860 
the floor of the car so that when you go
through<00:04:54.710> your<00:04:54.950> plug<00:04:55.310> weld<00:04:55.580> operation<00:04:56.270> there's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
through your plug weld operation there's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.200 
through your plug weld operation there's
no<00:04:57.080> gap<00:04:57.380> between<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:58.010> pocket<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:58.910> floor

no gap between the pocket and the floor

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.820 
no gap between the pocket and the floor
so<00:05:00.140> we<00:05:00.350> used<00:05:00.560> our<00:05:00.710> HTP<00:05:01.460> mig<00:05:01.940> 200<00:05:02.570> MIG<00:05:02.780> welder<00:05:03.170> to

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
so we used our HTP mig 200 MIG welder to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.010 
so we used our HTP mig 200 MIG welder to
plug<00:05:04.160> weld<00:05:04.400> all<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.390> holes<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:05.780> we<00:05:05.840> had

have<00:05:58.430> to<00:05:58.580> measure<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.449> proper<00:05:59.810> area<00:06:00.139> so<00:06:00.500> you

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
have to measure the proper area so you

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.680 
have to measure the proper area so you
know<00:06:00.740> where<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.009> cut<00:06:01.250> we<00:06:02.180> use<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.479> plasma

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
know where to cut we use the plasma

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.920 
know where to cut we use the plasma
cutter<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.889> some<00:06:04.340> other<00:06:04.460> tools<00:06:04.759> to<00:06:05.150> cut<00:06:05.900> a

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
cutter and and some other tools to cut a

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.140 
cutter and and some other tools to cut a
big<00:06:06.169> hole<00:06:06.199> in<00:06:06.470> this<00:06:06.800> Camaros<00:06:07.250> trunk<00:06:07.550> floor<00:06:07.789> and

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
big hole in this Camaros trunk floor and

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.390 
big hole in this Camaros trunk floor and
then<00:06:08.840> we<00:06:08.900> took<00:06:09.050> some<00:06:09.229> time<00:06:09.259> to<00:06:09.620> properly<00:06:09.860> grind

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
then we took some time to properly grind

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.710 
then we took some time to properly grind
that<00:06:10.610> hole<00:06:10.849> and<00:06:11.060> make<00:06:11.210> sure<00:06:11.360> it's<00:06:11.539> the<00:06:11.599> right

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
that hole and make sure it's the right

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.129 
that hole and make sure it's the right
size<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:12.470> then<00:06:13.039> position<00:06:13.699> this<00:06:14.330> fabricated

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
size and then position this fabricated

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.790 
size and then position this fabricated
new<00:06:15.789> pocket<00:06:16.789> in<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.270> floor<00:06:17.539> and<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:18.380> pocket

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
new pocket in the floor and the pocket

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.680 
new pocket in the floor and the pocket
is<00:06:18.889> there<00:06:19.099> because<00:06:19.370> as<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:20.030> Detroit<00:06:20.389> speed

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
is there because as the Detroit speed

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.650 
is there because as the Detroit speed
rear<00:06:21.380> suspension<00:06:21.949> system<00:06:22.340> articulates<00:06:22.940> the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
rear suspension system articulates the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.420 
rear suspension system articulates the
upper<00:06:23.930> panhard<00:06:24.349> mount<00:06:24.650> actually<00:06:25.160> would

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
upper panhard mount actually would

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.640 
upper panhard mount actually would
protrude<00:06:25.910> into<00:06:26.300> the<00:06:26.780> Camaro's<00:06:27.139> trunk<00:06:27.409> floor

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
protrude into the Camaro's trunk floor

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.089 
protrude into the Camaro's trunk floor
so<00:06:28.370> this<00:06:28.550> provides<00:06:28.909> a<00:06:29.389> clearance<00:06:29.990> area<00:06:30.470> so

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
so this provides a clearance area so

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.210 
so this provides a clearance area so
that<00:06:31.130> you<00:06:31.400> don't<00:06:31.610> have<00:06:31.669> any<00:06:31.849> contact<00:06:32.330> points

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
that you don't have any contact points

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.800 
that you don't have any contact points
again<00:06:34.220> this<00:06:34.400> piece<00:06:34.610> gets<00:06:34.880> welded<00:06:35.120> in<00:06:35.389> all<00:06:35.630> the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
again this piece gets welded in all the

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.830 
again this piece gets welded in all the
way<00:06:35.930> around<00:06:36.260> Nick<00:06:37.010> took<00:06:37.220> some<00:06:37.460> time<00:06:37.639> to<00:06:38.030> make

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
way around Nick took some time to make

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.469 
way around Nick took some time to make
weld<00:06:39.139> small<00:06:39.680> sections<00:06:40.190> at<00:06:40.310> a<00:06:40.370> time<00:06:40.400> so<00:06:41.330> he

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
weld small sections at a time so he

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:42.969 
weld small sections at a time so he
didn't<00:06:41.750> introduce<00:06:42.020> a<00:06:42.320> lot<00:06:42.470> of<00:06:42.620> heat<00:06:42.800> and

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
didn't introduce a lot of heat and

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.950 
didn't introduce a lot of heat and
