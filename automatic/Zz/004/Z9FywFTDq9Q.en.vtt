00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:14.400
 purl tunisian loop also 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:19.380
 like in any other knitting we start 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 first row of chain of air loops 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.310
 those walls 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.710
 and so many first row we knit 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.560
 the conventional low-poster ie 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.560
 looped from a chain 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.340
 and so knit closing the chain 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:22.299
 now we start to knit purl this 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:26.650
 low loop thread translate before 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.110
 hook go under the front leg 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.300
 column as well as in a simple Tunisian 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 posts 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.360
 hook up 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 moving away from you and stretching like that 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.600
 loop hook 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:51.429
 in the back of the loop we enter do a cape and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:57.030
 we stretch the thread in front of the crochet 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:02:02.800
 I pull the thread in front of the hook 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:07.330
 nakid stretch and so knit until the end 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.840
 a number of it will be purl Tunisian 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.840
 loops 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:26.480
 the last column we type is simple 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.650
 Tunisian also stretch not through 1 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.530
 loop no further than dad-1 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.530
 close all fives 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.610
 let's take one more row to make it clear 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:53.660
 what does it mean a thread in front of a hook we take away 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.660
 nakid stretch 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.390
 this knitting is more so laborious it goes 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.110
 slower than this simple tunisian 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.760
 column whether facial loop tunisian 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.420
 used mainly to create 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.660
 patterns that is entirely so 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.200
 purlous low loops hardly 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.470
 you will knit and last simple 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.470
 tunisian column and close this row 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:38.880
 further knitting is generally repeated as 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.769
 see here it turned out very similar to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.299
 purl knitting but 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.849
 drawing tighter 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:52.480
 So I knitted this pattern is 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:53.079
 purl loops are almost the same on both 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.950
 parties 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:02.220
 a little difference after all is like this 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.220
 that looks like a purl then a low loop
