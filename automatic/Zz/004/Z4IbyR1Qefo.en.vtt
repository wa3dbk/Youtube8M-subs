00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
before we had South Africa using a lot

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.580

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.520 
use the driving wall a lot quite
effectively<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.580> dealt<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> before

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
effectively so we dealt with it before

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.109

was disappointed we had a try disallowed

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.120 
was disappointed we had a try disallowed
against<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> All<00:01:42.750> Blacks<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.710> scored<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
few minutes after from the scrum wager

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
few minutes after from the scrum wager
launch<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.170> scored<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> drove<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

France<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.630> gets<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> big<00:01:49.079> pack<00:01:49.610> Scotland<00:01:50.659> we

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
France it gets a big pack Scotland we

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.359 
France it gets a big pack Scotland we
probably<00:01:51.869> didn't<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.829> reward<00:01:53.159> for

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
probably didn't get the the reward for

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.850 
probably didn't get the the reward for
our<00:01:53.430> dominance<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.329> particularly<00:01:54.860> in

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
our dominance there particularly in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
our dominance there particularly in
there<00:01:56.130> their<00:01:56.549> goal<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.939> five<00:01:57.509> minutes<00:01:57.780> out

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
there their goal on five minutes out

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.030 
there their goal on five minutes out
from<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.110> try<00:01:58.229> line<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:58.979> we

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
from there try line which I think we

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.859 
from there try line which I think we
visited<00:01:59.430> at<00:01:59.549> seven<00:01:59.880> times<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.479> didn't

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
visited at seven times and we didn't

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.359 
visited at seven times and we didn't
school<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.409> though<00:02:01.500> Luther<00:02:01.920> scored<00:02:02.250> his
