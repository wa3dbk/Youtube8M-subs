up<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.680> was<00:03:03.950> really<00:03:04.220> interested<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.000> dress

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
up I was really interested in this dress

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.790 
up I was really interested in this dress
because<00:03:05.830> I'm<00:03:06.830> doing<00:03:07.070> photography<00:03:07.580> now<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.800> my

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
because I'm doing photography now and my

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.990 
because I'm doing photography now and my
husband<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.340> are<00:03:10.610> thinking<00:03:10.910> about

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
husband and I are thinking about

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.890 
husband and I are thinking about
renewing<00:03:11.750> our<00:03:11.930> vows<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.090> figured<00:03:14.720> this

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
renewing our vows and so I figured this

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.590 
renewing our vows and so I figured this
would<00:03:15.080> be<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.260> perfect<00:03:15.890> outfit<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:17.180> was

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
would be the perfect outfit I was

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.240 
would be the perfect outfit I was
thinking<00:03:17.840> about<00:03:17.930> doing<00:03:18.140> some<00:03:18.410> alteration<00:03:19.040> but

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
thinking about doing some alteration but

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.490 
thinking about doing some alteration but
after<00:03:19.580> trying<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.090> dress<00:03:20.150> I'm<00:03:20.780> not<00:03:21.200> gonna<00:03:21.410> do

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
after trying this dress I'm not gonna do

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.950 
after trying this dress I'm not gonna do
any<00:03:21.710> type<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:21.920> alteration<00:03:22.550> if<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.820> do<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.420> might

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
any type of alteration if I do I might

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.670 
any type of alteration if I do I might
take<00:03:24.350> just<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.280> part<00:03:25.670> out<00:03:26.320> just<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:27.470> that

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
take just this part out just so that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.610

there's<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.040> little<00:03:28.340> bit<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:29.170> cleavage<00:03:30.170> because

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
there's a little bit of cleavage because

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.390

it's very sophisticated and very elegant

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.080

it<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:35.770> off-white<00:03:36.770> or<00:03:37.100> cream<00:03:37.430> color<00:03:37.460> it's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
it is a off-white or cream color it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.070 
it is a off-white or cream color it's
not<00:03:38.420> white<00:03:38.840> I'm<00:03:39.380> pretty<00:03:39.740> sure<00:03:39.890> if<00:03:40.070> I<00:03:41.080> dryclean

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.630 
not white I'm pretty sure if I dryclean
it<00:03:42.110> will<00:03:42.380> still<00:03:42.620> be<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.830> same<00:03:42.980> color<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.520> it's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
it will still be the same color so it's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.970 
it will still be the same color so it's
not<00:03:43.820> really<00:03:44.300> white<00:03:45.020> but<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.250> beautiful

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.980 
sleeve it is quite big on the sleeve and
it's<00:03:56.360> quite<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.050> small<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:58.130> wedding<00:03:58.430> dress<00:03:58.990> but

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
it's quite a small the wedding dress but

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.630 
it's quite a small the wedding dress but
I<00:04:00.020> do<00:04:00.140> plan<00:04:00.470> on<00:04:00.530> losing<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:01.010> little<00:04:01.130> more<00:04:01.400> weight

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
I do plan on losing a little more weight

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.630 
I do plan on losing a little more weight
so<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.090> actually<00:04:02.480> fits<00:04:02.690> me<00:04:02.900> right<00:04:03.580> on<00:04:04.580> the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
so this actually fits me right on the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.290 
so this actually fits me right on the
bust<00:04:05.270> area<00:04:05.510> here<00:04:05.900> cuz<00:04:06.200> I'm<00:04:07.160> up<00:04:07.370> 36<00:04:07.940> all<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.210> way

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
bust area here cuz I'm up 36 all the way

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.880 
bust area here cuz I'm up 36 all the way
around<00:04:08.630> so<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.110> really<00:04:09.350> hard<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.740> actually

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
around so it's really hard to actually

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.540 
around so it's really hard to actually
find<00:04:10.070> something<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.700> actually<00:04:10.850> fit<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:13.280> and

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
at it and then think that it might fit

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.640 
at it and then think that it might fit
you<00:04:28.760> or<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.360> might<00:04:29.690> not<00:04:29.720> look<00:04:29.990> good<00:04:30.140> on<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:30.440> but

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
train it's actually really light and I'm

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.730 
train it's actually really light and I'm
very<00:04:41.820> happy<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.570> found<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.260> this

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
very happy that I found this and this

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.830 
very happy that I found this and this
wasn't<00:04:43.950> really<00:04:44.160> Julian<00:04:44.610> 999<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.690> you're

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
wasn't really Julian 999 if you're

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.740 
wasn't really Julian 999 if you're
wondering<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.640> actually<00:04:47.640> got<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:47.970> for<00:04:48.090> 30%<00:04:48.450> off

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
wondering I actually got it for 30% off

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.250 
wondering I actually got it for 30% off
so<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.290> was<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.710> little<00:04:50.160> bit<00:04:50.280> under<00:04:50.840> $7<00:04:51.840> and

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
so it was like a little bit under $7 and

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.620 
so it was like a little bit under $7 and
where<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.160> live<00:04:53.490> there's<00:04:53.670> no<00:04:53.820> tax<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:54.390> that's

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
where I live there's no tax so that's

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.430 
where I live there's no tax so that's
awesome

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
awesome

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.810 
awesome
and<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.640> don't<00:04:57.090> see<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.900> name<00:04:58.260> tag<00:04:58.620> anywhere<00:04:59.340> so

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
and I don't see a name tag anywhere so

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.500 
and I don't see a name tag anywhere so
I'm<00:04:59.970> guessing<00:05:00.450> this<00:05:00.660> must<00:05:01.470> be<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:05.210> special<00:05:06.210> me

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
I'm guessing this must be a a special me

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.550 
I'm guessing this must be a a special me
