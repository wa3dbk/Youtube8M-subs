00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.160 

we're<00:03:03.790> probably<00:03:04.420> going<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.870> scratch

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
now they're probably going to have to

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.480 
now they're probably going to have to
back<00:03:11.260> well<00:03:11.590> they<00:03:11.710> are<00:03:11.860> going<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.070> have<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> back

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.580 

while<00:03:16.730> quality<00:03:17.390> road<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.780> almost<00:03:18.080> certainly

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
while quality road is almost certainly

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.360 
while quality road is almost certainly
they<00:03:19.160> really<00:03:19.490> need<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.730> pick<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> blindfold

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
they really need to pick the blindfold

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.810 
they really need to pick the blindfold
exactly<00:03:23.380> there<00:03:24.380> could<00:03:24.710> be<00:03:24.740> a<00:03:25.160> late<00:03:25.520> scratch

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
exactly there could be a late scratch

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.730 
exactly there could be a late scratch
here<00:03:26.180> with<00:03:26.330> quality<00:03:26.750> road<00:03:26.960> now<00:03:27.200> the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
here with quality road now the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.040 
here with quality road now the
veterinarian<00:03:28.370> will<00:03:29.000> tend<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.420> him<00:03:29.600> Jerry<00:03:29.900> and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
if there's no visible cuts you'll have

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.500 
if there's no visible cuts you'll have
Johnny<00:03:34.130> Velazquez<00:03:34.640> jogging<00:03:35.060> back<00:03:35.180> up<00:03:35.360> and

Johnny Velazquez jogging back up and
down<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:35.810> if<00:03:35.900> there<00:03:36.080> are<00:03:36.170> visible<00:03:36.530> cuts<00:03:36.770> he

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
down but if there are visible cuts he

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.530

him up and down but it's simply

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.930 
him up and down but it's simply
impossible<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.800> know<00:03:43.010> how<00:03:43.190> much<00:03:43.400> damage<00:03:43.670> he

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
impossible to know how much damage he

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.060 
impossible to know how much damage he
could<00:03:44.060> have<00:03:44.210> done<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.810> could<00:03:45.140> be<00:03:45.290> subcutaneous

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
could have done it could be subcutaneous

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.800 
could have done it could be subcutaneous
injuries<00:03:46.520> here<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:46.970> might<00:03:47.240> be<00:03:47.390> he<00:03:47.510> shouldn't
