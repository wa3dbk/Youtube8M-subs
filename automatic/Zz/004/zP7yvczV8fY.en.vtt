00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
personally I think it's gonna be either

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.880 
personally I think it's gonna be either
carbon<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> new<00:00:42.210> most<00:00:42.899> wanted<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.590> because

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
carbon or a new most wanted just because

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
carbon or a new most wanted just because
of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> cops<00:00:44.309> feature<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:45.000> underground<00:00:45.360> there

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
was no cops so it didn't really fit into

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910 
was no cops so it didn't really fit into
that<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.239> thought<00:00:48.629> anyway<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.019> yeah<00:00:49.650> let's<00:00:49.800> go
