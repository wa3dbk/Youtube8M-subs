might be I'm popular now but people love
me<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.230> it's<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.129> know<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.399> kind

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
me and it's actually you know it's kind

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
me and it's actually you know it's kind
of<00:00:56.699> funny<00:00:56.969> obviously<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> same<00:00:58.050> time

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
of funny obviously but at the same time

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.610 
of funny obviously but at the same time
it's<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.480> think<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:00.899> significant

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it's I think it's very significant

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's I think it's very significant
because<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.820> gives<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.149> their<00:01:03.449> frame

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
because it really gives you their frame

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.969 
because it really gives you their frame
of<00:01:03.840> mind<00:01:04.019> their<00:01:04.229> frame<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.559> mind<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> very

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
of mind their frame of mind is very

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
of mind their frame of mind is very
dangerous<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
dangerous in this way if you have a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
dangerous in this way if you have a
person<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.950> he<00:01:08.100> says<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> Truman<00:01:08.790> quote

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and and then for Lincoln to some degree

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
and and then for Lincoln to some degree
