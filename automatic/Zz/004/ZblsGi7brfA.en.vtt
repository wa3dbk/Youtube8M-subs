00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
the basic architecture of the vehicle

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.770 
the basic architecture of the vehicle
being<00:01:38.560> very<00:01:38.830> sleek<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.400> aerodynamic<00:01:40.030> but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
also have for instance the seven slot

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.750 
also have for instance the seven slot
grill<00:01:43.299> seven<00:01:43.720> slot<00:01:43.930> grill<00:01:44.229> courses<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.250> key<00:01:45.610> on

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
grill seven slot grill courses is key on

grill seven slot grill courses is key on
every<00:01:46.030> front<00:01:46.210> end<00:01:46.420> jeep<00:01:46.840> but<00:01:47.650> this<00:01:47.799> one<00:01:47.950> has

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
every front end jeep but this one has

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.100 
every front end jeep but this one has
this<00:01:48.250> snap<00:01:48.580> in<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.180> it's<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:49.930> an

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
this snap in it and it's really an

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.990 
this snap in it and it's really an
amplification<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:51.040> something<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.640> got<00:01:51.790> from

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
amplification of something we got from

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.330 
amplification of something we got from
the<00:01:52.119> nineteen<00:01:52.450> seventy-four<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.920> original

the nineteen seventy-four the original

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.010 
the nineteen seventy-four the original
Cherokee<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.150> was<00:01:55.270> used<00:01:55.450> throughout<00:01:55.570> on

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
Cherokee and it was used throughout on

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.000 
Cherokee and it was used throughout on
XJ<00:01:56.470> TJ<00:01:57.070> YJ<00:01:57.640> much<00:01:58.119> quieter<00:01:58.630> there<00:01:58.840> but<00:01:59.830> here

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
XJ TJ YJ much quieter there but here

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.830 
XJ TJ YJ much quieter there but here
it's<00:02:00.460> more<00:02:00.610> prominent<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.299> split<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.659> lights

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
it's more prominent we split the lights

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's more prominent we split the lights
up<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.200> little<00:02:02.409> bit<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.130> headlight<00:02:03.430> is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
up a little bit the headlight is

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.640 
up a little bit the headlight is
actually<00:02:03.909> down<00:02:04.030> here<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.630> it's<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.200> it's<00:02:05.500> a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
actually down here and it's and it's a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.370 
actually down here and it's and it's a
projector<00:02:06.130> unit<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:07.330> main<00:02:07.750> feature<00:02:07.990> light

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
projector unit the main feature light

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.469 
projector unit the main feature light
which<00:02:08.799> is<00:02:08.830> an<00:02:09.070> LED<00:02:09.459> running<00:02:09.700> light<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.330> on

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
which is an LED running light it's on

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.910 
which is an LED running light it's on
all<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> time<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.140> vehicles<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.650> drive

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
all the time of the vehicles and drive

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400 
all the time of the vehicles and drive
but<00:02:12.459> if<00:02:12.549> you<00:02:12.640> look<00:02:12.730> at<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.170> plan

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
but if you look at this the the plan

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.570 
but if you look at this the the plan
view<00:02:14.620> shape<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.070> there's<00:02:15.220> really<00:02:15.370> not<00:02:15.519> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
view shape here there's really not a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.880 
view shape here there's really not a
corner<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.630> was<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:17.019> driven<00:02:17.560> by

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
corner there and it was really driven by

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.550 
corner there and it was really driven by
aerodynamics<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.720> sets<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.260> kind<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
aerodynamics and it sets up this kind of

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.509
