right<00:00:00.690> yeah<00:00:01.139> hi<00:00:01.290> rewrap<00:00:01.589> mix<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.189> saw<00:00:02.669> this

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
right yeah hi rewrap mix and I saw this

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.090 
right yeah hi rewrap mix and I saw this
really<00:00:02.969> really<00:00:03.120> cool<00:00:03.379> robot<00:00:04.379> that's<00:00:04.799> kind<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
really really cool robot that's kind of

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.519 
really really cool robot that's kind of
being<00:00:05.669> run<00:00:05.879> by<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> Kinect<00:00:06.480> unit<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.470> I

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
being run by the Kinect unit and I

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.320 
being run by the Kinect unit and I
thought<00:00:07.680> I'd<00:00:07.859> ask<00:00:08.010> how<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.940> all<00:00:09.060> works

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
thought I'd ask how it all works

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.520 
thought I'd ask how it all works
introduce<00:00:10.050> yourself

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
introduce yourself

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.560 
introduce yourself
oh<00:00:10.560> yeah<00:00:10.890> so<00:00:11.130> I'm<00:00:11.400> very<00:00:11.790> Philippe<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.420> I'm

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
oh yeah so I'm very Philippe and I'm

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.260 
oh yeah so I'm very Philippe and I'm
from<00:00:13.050> the<00:00:13.140> flight<00:00:13.350> sciences<00:00:13.560> stupid<00:00:14.010> fight<00:00:14.270> so

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
from the flight sciences stupid fight so

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.519 
from the flight sciences stupid fight so
what<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.540> did<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:15.720> is<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.439> an

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
what we did here is that we have an

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.200 
what we did here is that we have an
autonomous<00:00:17.039> robot<00:00:17.189> that<00:00:17.519> uses<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.880> second

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
autonomous robot that uses a second

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
autonomous robot that uses a second
extensor<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.839> build<00:00:19.019> a<00:00:19.109> rich<00:00:19.289> 3d<00:00:19.619> map<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
extensor to build a rich 3d map of the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.099 
extensor to build a rich 3d map of the
environment<00:00:20.160> around<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> uses

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
environment around it and it uses

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
environment around it and it uses
Microsoft<00:00:22.410> robotic<00:00:22.949> studio<00:00:23.249> to<00:00:23.579> talk<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.089> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
Microsoft robotic studio to talk to the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.749 
Microsoft robotic studio to talk to the
hyper<00:00:24.599> platform<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.279> here<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
hyper platform so what you see here is

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.130 
hyper platform so what you see here is
the<00:00:26.849> processing<00:00:27.300> that's<00:00:27.419> going<00:00:27.839> on<00:00:27.929> on<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the processing that's going on on the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290 
the processing that's going on on the
connect<00:00:28.380> data<00:00:28.560> these<00:00:29.460> red<00:00:29.699> regions<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:30.269> are

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
connect data these red regions there are

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
connect data these red regions there are
obstacles<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> green<00:00:31.409> is<00:00:31.650> safe<00:00:31.859> paths

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
obstacles and the green is safe paths

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.400 
obstacles and the green is safe paths
and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.910> blue<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.150> its<00:00:33.420> current<00:00:33.720> estimate<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and the blue is its current estimate of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.320 
and the blue is its current estimate of
what<00:00:34.860> its<00:00:35.010> own<00:00:35.190> position<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> yellow

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
what its own position is in the yellow

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.910 
what its own position is in the yellow
is<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> waypoint<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.290> computes<00:00:37.560> on<00:00:37.800> its

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
is a waypoint that it computes on its

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.500 
is a waypoint that it computes on its
own<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.640> both<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.970> figure<00:00:39.210> out<00:00:39.300> where<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
own for both to figure out where I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.960 
own for both to figure out where I
should<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.750> next<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.220> idea<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.670> it's

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
should go next so the idea is that it's

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.370 
should go next so the idea is that it's
going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> keep<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.570> around<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.110> keep

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
going to keep going around it keep

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.220 
going to keep going around it keep
trying<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.710> locate<00:00:43.980> same<00:00:44.280> paths<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:45.450> reach

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
trying to locate same paths and reach

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
trying to locate same paths and reach
that<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.340> something<00:00:48.150> comes<00:00:48.330> an

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that and if something comes an

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
that and if something comes an
obstruction<00:00:49.140> spots<00:00:49.410> when<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.740> try<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> avoid

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
obstruction spots when you try to avoid

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
obstruction spots when you try to avoid
it<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.640> work<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:51.060> it<00:00:51.240> so<00:00:51.810> it<00:00:51.870> works<00:00:52.020> pretty

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it or work around it so it works pretty

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.950 
it or work around it so it works pretty
well<00:00:52.380> in<00:00:52.560> our<00:00:52.770> environments

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
well in our environments

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.260 
well in our environments
stuck<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.230> team

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.900 

so<00:01:01.840> how<00:01:01.960> long<00:01:02.140> pollinated<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.920> build<00:01:03.100> us<00:01:03.250> so

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
so how long pollinated to build us so

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.120 
so how long pollinated to build us so
this<00:01:04.810> took<00:01:04.960> about<00:01:05.050> two<00:01:05.320> weeks<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.650> build<00:01:05.800> for

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
this took about two weeks to build for

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.640 
this took about two weeks to build for
the<00:01:06.820> obstacle<00:01:07.420> detection<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:08.140> integration

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
the obstacle detection and integration

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.350 
the obstacle detection and integration
reducer<00:01:09.040> robotics<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.670> really<00:01:09.970> makes<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.240> easy

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
reducer robotics it really makes it easy

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.460 
reducer robotics it really makes it easy
so<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:12.250> also<00:01:12.370> detects<00:01:12.730> moving<00:01:13.030> objects<00:01:13.480> and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
so it also detects moving objects and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:39.710 
so it also detects moving objects and
are<00:01:14.620> dynamically

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.290 

so<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:41.040> kind<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> real-world<00:01:41.490> applications

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
so what kind of real-world applications

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.820 
so what kind of real-world applications
do<00:01:42.480> you<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.840> something<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.230> this<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
do you see with something like this so

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.190 
do you see with something like this so
bitter<00:01:44.730> love<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:45.930> should<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
bitter love I think you should the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.690 
bitter love I think you should the
underlying<00:01:46.590> technology<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.400> 3d

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
underlying technology which is a 3d

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
underlying technology which is a 3d
mapping<00:01:48.000> itself<00:01:48.900> that's<00:01:49.080> what<00:01:49.290> I'm<00:01:49.470> not

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
mapping itself that's what I'm not

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.500 
mapping itself that's what I'm not
showing<00:01:50.010> here<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> visualization<00:01:51.120> is

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
showing here in the visualization is

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.910 
showing here in the visualization is
that<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.750> building<00:01:52.170> against<00:01:52.530> rain<00:01:52.650> cloud

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that it's building against rain cloud

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
that it's building against rain cloud
something<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:54.120> could<00:01:54.300> be<00:01:54.420> used<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
something like that could be used to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
something like that could be used to
build<00:01:54.780> walls<00:01:55.050> of<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.350> room<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.740> instance<00:01:56.040> or

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
build walls of the room for instance or

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
build walls of the room for instance or
you<00:01:56.820> could<00:01:57.000> use<00:01:57.120> that<00:01:57.150> same<00:01:57.390> information

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you could use that same information

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.360 
you could use that same information
because<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.470> also<00:01:58.620> single<00:01:58.980> beam<00:01:59.100> easily

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
because it's also single beam easily

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.310 
because it's also single beam easily

autonomous<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.120> know<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.450> instance<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
autonomous and you know for instance the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
autonomous and you know for instance the
Roomba<00:02:07.080> right<00:02:07.260> now<00:02:07.440> there's<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.130> bump<00:02:08.340> since

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
Roomba right now there's a bump since

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.110 
Roomba right now there's a bump since
the<00:02:08.729> crucifixion<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.460> have<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> robot<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the crucifixion you can have a robot it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.150 
the crucifixion you can have a robot it
actually<00:02:12.270> works<00:02:12.690> wrong<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.350> know<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> sense<00:02:13.980> of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
actually works wrong you know a sense of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.520 
actually works wrong you know a sense of
where<00:02:14.970> people<00:02:15.000> are<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.660> great<00:02:15.900> obstacles<00:02:16.410> are

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
where people are and great obstacles are

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.490 
where people are and great obstacles are
and<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.740> watch<00:02:16.920> them<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.520> not<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.910> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and I watch them so it's not just a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.960 
and I watch them so it's not just a
passive<00:02:19.500> robot<00:02:20.130> that's<00:02:20.760> actually<00:02:21.150> sensing

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
passive robot that's actually sensing

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.890 
passive robot that's actually sensing
what<00:02:23.970> other<00:02:24.090> things<00:02:24.300> are<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.480> working<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.810> at

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
what other things are you working on at

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.860 
what other things are you working on at
Microsoft<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.060> with<00:02:27.060> Applied<00:02:27.330> Sciences<00:02:27.660> group

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
Microsoft so with Applied Sciences group

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080 
Microsoft so with Applied Sciences group
we<00:02:28.080> do<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> lot<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.530> work<00:02:28.740> he<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:29.820> compete

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
we do a lot of work he will compete

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.590 
we do a lot of work he will compete
faces<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.500> we're<00:02:31.800> working<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.760> lot<00:02:33.090> with<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
faces so we're working a lot with the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.740 
faces so we're working a lot with the
Xbox<00:02:34.230> surface<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:36.240> know<00:02:36.330> there<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> lot<00:02:36.720> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
Xbox surface you know there are a lot of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
Xbox surface you know there are a lot of
projects<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.440> essentially<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.070> computer

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
projects and I essentially a computer

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
projects and I essentially a computer
vision<00:02:38.490> researchers<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.210> my<00:02:39.360> go<00:02:39.600> against<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
vision researchers so my go against to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.890 
vision researchers so my go against to
you<00:02:40.980> know<00:02:41.100> help<00:02:41.610> understand<00:02:42.600> what's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
you know help understand what's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.400 
you know help understand what's
happening<00:02:43.350> when<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:45.239> construct<00:02:45.690> 3d<00:02:45.989> geometry

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
happening when we construct 3d geometry

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.479 
happening when we construct 3d geometry
or

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
or

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.479 
or
in<00:02:48.060> Austria<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.959> like<00:02:49.109> this<00:02:49.950> project<00:02:50.189> was

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
in Austria it's like this project was

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.489 
in Austria it's like this project was
officially<00:02:50.939> born<00:02:51.090> out<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.299> blank<00:02:51.629> do<00:02:51.749> you<00:02:52.349> know

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:52.499 
officially born out of blank do you know

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.009 
officially born out of blank do you know
stitch<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.219> little<00:02:53.519> 20<00:02:53.819> maps<00:02:54.150> using<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.749> Kinect

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
stitch a little 20 maps using the Kinect

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720 
stitch a little 20 maps using the Kinect
sensor<00:02:55.099> since<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.159> can<00:02:56.310> easily<00:02:56.519> connect

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
sensor since you can easily connect

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.459 
sensor since you can easily connect
sensitive<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.150> room<00:02:57.299> scanner<00:02:57.540> yeah<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.379> you

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
sensitive the room scanner yeah so you

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.280 
sensitive the room scanner yeah so you
can<00:02:58.620> use<00:02:58.769> his<00:02:58.980> favorite<00:02:59.310> density<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.389> low<00:03:00.989> coos

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
can use his favorite density so low coos

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.800 
can use his favorite density so low coos
with<00:03:01.530> Microsoft<00:03:02.159> robotics<00:03:02.549> he<00:03:02.939> suggested

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
with Microsoft robotics he suggested

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.539 
with Microsoft robotics he suggested
inviting<00:03:03.930> people<00:03:04.260> monogamous<00:03:04.980> robot<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.519> of

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
inviting people monogamous robot out of

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.149 
inviting people monogamous robot out of
it<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:08.359> other<00:03:09.359> plans<00:03:09.689> online<00:03:10.109> to<00:03:10.230> download<00:03:10.349> how

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
it so other plans online to download how

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.129 
it so other plans online to download how
to<00:03:11.189> build<00:03:11.670> one<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.510> still<00:03:12.780> he<00:03:13.019> will

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
to build one or and still he will

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.589 
to build one or and still he will
certainly<00:03:13.739> put<00:03:13.980> some<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.340> our<00:03:14.489> at<00:03:15.090> some<00:03:15.269> point

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
certainly put some of our at some point

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.239 
certainly put some of our at some point
some<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.870> an<00:03:15.989> obstacle<00:03:16.260> detection<00:03:16.409> cool<00:03:16.919> it's

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:17.249 
some of an obstacle detection cool it's

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.619 
some of an obstacle detection cool it's
like<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.639> flex

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
like that flex

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.619 
like that flex
as<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.829> now<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.669> maximum<00:03:21.150> or<00:03:21.239> actually<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
as of now the maximum or actually it

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.449 
as of now the maximum or actually it
already<00:03:21.959> comes<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.469> a<00:03:22.680> platform<00:03:22.980> where<00:03:23.430> you

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
already comes with a platform where you

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.879 
already comes with a platform where you
can<00:03:23.730> interact<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.569> sentient<00:03:25.439> those<00:03:25.560> signals

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
can interact and sentient those signals

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.990 
can interact and sentient those signals
pretty<00:03:26.129> easily<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.209> platform<00:03:29.000> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
pretty easily to the platform the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.429 
pretty easily to the platform the
connected<00:03:30.540> mechanics<00:03:30.870> instead<00:03:31.169> of<00:03:31.260> being

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
connected mechanics instead of being

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.520 
connected mechanics instead of being
flat<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.949> know<00:03:32.780> provide<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.810> full<00:03:34.230> line<00:03:34.379> today

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
flat you know provide a full line today

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.470 
flat you know provide a full line today
that<00:03:34.769> probably<00:03:35.310> at<00:03:35.400> some<00:03:35.430> point<00:03:35.609> help<00:03:36.090> them<00:03:36.269> in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
that probably at some point help them in

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.020 
that probably at some point help them in
opening<00:03:36.840> 3d<00:03:37.109> maps<00:03:40.129> go<00:03:41.129> around<00:03:41.489> well<00:03:41.849> thanks
