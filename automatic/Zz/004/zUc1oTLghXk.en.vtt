00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
pack so but when you do that a little

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.119 
pack so but when you do that a little
bit<00:03:27.900> quicker<00:03:28.200> there's<00:03:28.620> time<00:03:28.799> I'll<00:03:29.010> do<00:03:29.099> a

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
bit quicker there's time I'll do a

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.979 
bit quicker there's time I'll do a
little<00:03:29.340> bit<00:03:29.489> quicker<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:30.000> still<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> little

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
little bit quicker but still a little

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.470 
little bit quicker but still a little
bit<00:03:31.079> slower<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:32.939> and<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.329> you're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
bit slower and then now and then you're

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.809 
bit slower and then now and then you're
just<00:03:33.659> miming<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.260> dragging<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.159> then<00:03:35.730> you

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
just miming and dragging it so then you

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.509 
just miming and dragging it so then you
just<00:03:36.000> go<00:03:36.180> into<00:03:36.329> this<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.900> miming<00:03:37.829> dragging<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
just go into this and miming dragging it

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.179 
just go into this and miming dragging it
down<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> then<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.329> rolling<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.260> off<00:03:40.439> and<00:03:40.709> at

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
down and then just rolling it off and at

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.800 
down and then just rolling it off and at
any<00:03:41.370> time<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.909> trick<00:03:42.150> they<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.689> actually

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
any time the trick they can actually

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.740 
any time the trick they can actually
feel<00:03:43.349> it<00:03:43.379> always<00:03:44.189> let<00:03:44.370> them<00:03:44.489> feel<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:45.060> after

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
feel it always let them feel it on after

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.390 
feel it always let them feel it on after
you<00:03:45.900> move<00:03:46.109> one<00:03:46.290> let<00:03:46.530> them<00:03:46.620> feel<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.250> make

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
you move one let them feel it to make

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.250 
you move one let them feel it to make
sure<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.269> paper<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.049> not

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
sure that it's just paper and it's not

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.220 
sure that it's just paper and it's not
and<00:03:49.769> that's<00:03:50.189> not<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:51.540> piece<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.139> paper

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
and that's not like a a piece of paper

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.979 
and that's not like a a piece of paper
that<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.650> move<00:03:52.799> down<00:03:53.040> or<00:03:53.069> anything<00:03:53.419> so<00:03:54.419> then

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
that can move down or anything so then

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
that can move down or anything so then
once<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.409> like<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.829> yes<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:56.849> to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
once it's like that yes so you have to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.089 
once it's like that yes so you have to
flip<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.359> over<00:03:57.479> it's<00:03:58.229> really<00:03:58.530> hard<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.829> put

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
flip it over it's really hard to put

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.439 
flip it over it's really hard to put
over<00:03:59.190> with<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.609> camera<00:03:59.970> because<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:00.269> facing

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
over with the camera because it's facing

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.839 
over with the camera because it's facing
down<00:04:00.739> usually<00:04:01.739> people<00:04:02.129> are<00:04:02.190> looking<00:04:02.519> straight

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
down usually people are looking straight

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.569 
down usually people are looking straight
not<00:04:03.090> looking<00:04:03.359> down<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.769> really<00:04:04.859> hard<00:04:05.129> but

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
not looking down so it's really hard but

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.420 
not looking down so it's really hard but
you<00:04:05.819> hold<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.419> okay<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.220> as<00:04:08.220> you're

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
you hold it like this okay and as you're

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.839 
you hold it like this okay and as you're
pointing<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.129> just<00:04:11.340> like<00:04:11.459> flip<00:04:11.669> it<00:04:11.790> over

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
pointing and you just like flip it over

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.659 
pointing and you just like flip it over

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
just instead of doing a double that's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.969 
just instead of doing a double that's
where<00:04:58.699> you<00:04:58.759> stop<00:04:59.030> at<00:04:59.270> two<00:04:59.479> cards<00:04:59.840> you're<00:05:00.710> just

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
where you stop at two cards you're just

doing a triple left where you stop at

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.529 
doing a triple left where you stop at
three<00:05:03.860> cards<00:05:04.159> like<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:04.430> then<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.120> just<00:05:05.330> flip

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539

it over and you say the last one is
always<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.069> hardest<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.150> flip<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.629> deck

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
always the hardest and you flip the deck

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.520 
always the hardest and you flip the deck
over<00:05:08.960> cuz<00:05:09.349> now<00:05:09.590> it's<00:05:10.719> now<00:05:11.719> now<00:05:12.050> it's<00:05:12.289> on<00:05:12.409> the

like move it over like this like that

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.659 
like move it over like this like that
and<00:05:23.199> then<00:05:24.199> you<00:05:24.740> can<00:05:24.889> hand<00:05:25.069> this<00:05:25.159> out<00:05:25.310> for

and then you can hand this out for
examination<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.629> as<00:05:27.319> they<00:05:27.529> do<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:27.680> you

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
examination and as they do that you

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.769 
examination and as they do that you
can't<00:05:28.250> flip<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.550> over<00:05:28.669> yet<00:05:28.939> because<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.270> card

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
can't flip it over yet because that card

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.619 
can't flip it over yet because that card
that<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.199> King<00:05:30.349> of<00:05:30.379> Hearts<00:05:30.560> is<00:05:30.740> there<00:05:31.629> but

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
that the King of Hearts is there but

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.140 
that the King of Hearts is there but
this<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:33.050> what<00:05:33.289> I<00:05:33.500> do<00:05:33.560> when<00:05:33.889> I<00:05:34.009> perform<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.490> they

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
this is what I do when I perform it they

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.570 
this is what I do when I perform it they
they<00:05:35.629> you<00:05:35.900> hand<00:05:36.529> it<00:05:36.620> out<00:05:36.710> for<00:05:36.949> examination

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
they you hand it out for examination

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.850 
they you hand it out for examination
then<00:05:37.759> I<00:05:37.819> get<00:05:38.539> that<00:05:38.870> I<00:05:38.900> can<00:05:38.990> take<00:05:39.289> the<00:05:39.439> card<00:05:39.620> back

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
then I get that I can take the card back

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.820 
then I get that I can take the card back
and<00:05:40.159> obviously<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:41.029> one<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:41.500> face-up<00:05:42.500> and

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
and obviously that one is face-up and

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.439 
and obviously that one is face-up and
they<00:05:42.949> can't<00:05:43.219> see<00:05:43.400> that<00:05:43.580> so<00:05:43.729> I<00:05:43.759> just<00:05:43.849> take<00:05:44.270> it

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
they can't see that so I just take it

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.200 
they can't see that so I just take it
and<00:05:44.569> I<00:05:44.659> put<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:44.960> on<00:05:45.550> on<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.729> deck<00:05:46.849> I've<00:05:47.029> got

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
and I put it on on the deck I've got

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.649 
and I put it on on the deck I've got
then<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.349> do<00:05:48.469> good<00:05:48.740> doublelift<00:05:49.219> and<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:50.270> pick<00:05:50.569> it

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
then I do good doublelift and I pick it

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.890 
then I do good doublelift and I pick it
up<00:05:50.750> like<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.400> so<00:05:52.400> now<00:05:52.520> it's<00:05:52.699> like<00:05:52.759> this<00:05:53.000> and

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
up like this so now it's like this and

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.980 
up like this so now it's like this and
be<00:05:54.080> careful<00:05:54.939> not<00:05:55.939> to<00:05:56.150> show<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:56.779> I<00:05:56.810> just

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
be careful not to show that so I just

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.499 
be careful not to show that so I just
