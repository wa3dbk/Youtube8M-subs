00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
how long it's going to take it might

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
how long it's going to take it might
take<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> couple<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.070> days<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:38.670> also

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
take a couple of days and that's also

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.610 
take a couple of days and that's also
the<00:00:39.239> reason<00:00:39.270> why<00:00:39.540> there's<00:00:40.230> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.469> been<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the reason why there's kind of been a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.530 
the reason why there's kind of been a
lack<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> uploads<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.239> I've

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
lack of uploads it's just because I've

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
lack of uploads it's just because I've
been<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.989> busy<00:00:43.160> handling<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
