00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.300
 to all of you here is no video of art 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.950
 in this video I will show you this 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.690
 nail art where we will have two colors in 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.510
 contrast or black and the 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.580
 yellow and the studs applied in this 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.679
 way because it was just this decor 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.429
 you can choose to reproduce it as 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.560
 the more you like it 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.449
 using any fantasy of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 few found just attached 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.349
 this exit 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.929
 let's move on to the tutorial itself 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.390
 applying to single color on all 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.130
 nails a base and choose it according to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.929
 of your needs I remind you that 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.730
 however the base dries a lot 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.350
 quickly 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.390
 Now let's move on to color writing 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.880
 same and use as I told him 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.260
 two colors yellow and we spread it a 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.750
 single color on the middle and ring finger 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.760
 we make very very subtle states 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.900
 because so much we will give two passes 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.090
 always remember the same 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.250
 precautions and cover the tip well 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.990
 on the remaining nails instead what 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.020
 we do apply and always with it 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.820
 same criterion a monochrome black and 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.780
 let's wait for it to dry 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.940
 lot 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.800
 now let's move on to the same decor 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.600
 using the studs I recommend you 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.600
 to pull the fodder to the bags that you 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.420
 serve so do you do first then ad 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.970
 apply them and you will not waste unnecessary time 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.979
 what you need to do take a top coat e 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.020
 apply it to the cuticles up to 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.659
 half fingernail which is the surface there 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.880
 will serve to decorate take the studs 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.460
 make a horizontal line first 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.830
 after which on one side and the other you will do 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.200
 a kind of triangle is indeed 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.240
 from the image however it will be seen as the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.970
 stock licenses exactly in this 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 this way this fantasy laurels 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.479
 still produced on all nails 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.580
 always using this criterion 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.950
 I give you advice when you apply 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.619
 studs to press lightly what less 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.720
 they will stick more to the surface and how 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.770
 we always wait for you to dry everything for 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 then pass the top coat to secure them in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.890
 video I show you still like 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.259
 click on two nails and always just 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.759
 with the same fantasy as I told you 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.679
 with the studs you can make 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.719
 lots of art in this too 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.810
 nail art you can vary from how you want 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.130
 also because in the box of deaths that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 you are in front of me really 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.010
 lots of different patterns and colors 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.230
 precisely to reproduce fair I knew is a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.090
 you and yours your wits e 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.820
 find many other nails anyway 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.799
 art to reproduce them as I told you 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.709
 true before the trick of 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.859
 spades that slightly downward 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.329
 to make it adhere very well to the top coat 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.670
 which we just used to 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.560
 glue them but also partially to the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 enamel under so in this way vi 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.359
 they will last longer as always when 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.190
 we open the nail finished tour 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.370
 art itself the application of all the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.290
 porche we have to pass the top coat on 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.060
 top short will be useful anyway 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.709
 last longer than nail art to make you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.930
 last longer than the enamel cover 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.329
 well the tip but also good enough 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.760
 over the studs because the top coat veins 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.500
 transparencies was so these times seem 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.660
 much brighter a lot more 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.540
 that is, you will notice much more then a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.980
 a very important point to do it 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.170
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.300
 now the image with the whole line 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.580
 the finished art the next video a 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.580
 big kiss to everyone but hello
