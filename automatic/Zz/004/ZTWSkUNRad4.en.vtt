00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.559
 tutorial and I have announced it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.850
 that we look at the forest again 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.190
 look in connection with the 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.590
 digital tv tuner and that will be today 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 as soon as we get the tvf in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.500
 we have full screen mode 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.830
 We call the following key assignments 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 us the guide directly in full picture on the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 we can see something on the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.160
 individual channels so you are seven sat 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 1 was one can then look what 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.740
 will come after how much only the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.360
 so the whole thing starts the pp 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.630
 Most stations also have one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.660
 so-called thumbnail with b arrived 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.850
 You always come back with a calling you 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.180
 the timeline on here you can see 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 that eg the blue bar of the now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.600
 is being filled 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.590
 I can rewind that's me 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 just go down 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.540
 say then i want to rewind now 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.079
 Can I say okay here 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.000
 then 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.740
 I want to see again then 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.110
 I go to play and there I can 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.940
 this is exactly where the do co is now 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 here at ddr currently in the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.960
 background is running formally new show like that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 then of course I have the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.090
 possibility at the very front and the cc too 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 I would like to say a subtitle 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.850
 switched turn let's hope 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850
 that here is a row 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.299
 There is not much talk right now 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.990
 that's why no 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.400
 subtitle he works thus have 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.229
 we also subtitles you can 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.440
 of course, always back here 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.330
 confirm each turn off so 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.940
 this is clear track ahead so 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 forward there is forward play 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.360
 play pause rewind to flip over 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.640
 and then we have a say times 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.060
 three of them bar three beams war or 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.950
 With 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.260
 then we see that is going on right now 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:08.070
 currently back on this station 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.420
 since we have the possibility of a tv 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.030
 Globo TV screen connecting with 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.860
 two ball well that looks like that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.080
 Lord always calls the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
 Ball shows where you just see it 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 what's on the individual channels 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.660
 running oberland could switch 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.330
 it's like just one 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.310
 voransicht just like this one we here 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.880
 go do more there 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.560
 actually here at the bunch not to say 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.820
 the controls should almost self 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.990
 Of course, there is still the explanation 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.240
 possibility of a remote control 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.680
 in addition to using it with 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.110
 Safety also very handy if you are 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.360
 really everything about the xbox of 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 Of course there is also 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.300
 the possibility that you have the moonlight 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.610
 via voice control, then 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.930
 voice support can control that 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.520
 Of course it stays there for me 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.980
 actually only to say I hope 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.080
 that little to toni had pieces falling 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.299
