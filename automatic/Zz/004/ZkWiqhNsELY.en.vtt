reason why I did this idea is cuz I
thought<00:02:39.610> making<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.090> dual<00:02:40.240> video<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.540> so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
thought making a dual video is so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.190 
thought making a dual video is so
generic<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.830> boring<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> took<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.390> spin<00:02:44.080> on

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
generic and boring so I took my spin on

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.550 
generic and boring so I took my spin on
it<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.580> made<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.760> dual<00:02:46.240> video<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:47.500> you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
it and made this dual video so if you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.020 
it and made this dual video so if you
guys<00:02:47.650> liked<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:47.980> please<00:02:48.160> give<00:02:48.610> me<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> thumbs<00:02:48.910> up
