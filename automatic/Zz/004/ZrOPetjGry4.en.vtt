00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello, I understand this to the server and I 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.189
 rub master welcome sixth lesson 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.660
 from the manga series 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.230
 studio delti import file get away 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.690
 and lte 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 we already encountered in the fourth lesson yes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.420
 then I did not decipher it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 de this is dimensional l this line t is tons 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 file selection is similar to simple import 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 pictures considered in the fifth lesson 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.260
 bookmark movement transformation too 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.320
 consider a bookmark 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.880
 delti the Today screen settings tab is 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.040
 lte 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.719
 setting rendering resolution to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.879
 exit 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.660
 sketching exit finish 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.570
 settling the island I'm graduation 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.129
 multi-ton i gradation after rendering 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 the image is transformed strawberry to the side 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.809
 layers if you choose the first option then all 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.100
 shading will consist of one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 raster layer 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.219
 if 2 then it will be a set of screen 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 tones of setting the outer line thickness 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.650
 external line unfortunately does not give previews 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.900
 a complete picture of what 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.330
 it turns out at the exit say changes 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 this parameter is invisible until 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 rendering so and if you only 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.860
 get acquainted with this type of import to you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 will have to experiment a lot 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.250
 detection after coarsening amount 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.130
 gradations extrusion lines type 1 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.990
 trunk transition value 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.140
 detecting direction from top to bottom 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.369
 on the left to the left if I may say so 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.189
 this is similar 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 light sources anti-noise power 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.630
 tests showed that the difference between 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.290
 maximum and minimum value 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.520
 almost invisible type 2 face thickness 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.750
 the threshold change in the slope threshold distance 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.430
 Understand the processing of version 3 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.939
 save anti-aliasing settings 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.450
 coarsening threshold fill black 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.100
 coarsening coincidence with gradation tone 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.920
 if you put the recess will 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.649
 match in gradation tons amount 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.370

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.500
 like a scanner or camera usually in it 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.989

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.689
