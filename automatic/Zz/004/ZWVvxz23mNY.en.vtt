00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.850
 Goodmorning everyone 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.620
 this is the video of finished products 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.469
 of February in collaboration 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 with veronica but this month from 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.500
 in fact I decided to do it myself 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.609
 justifications actually veronica mi 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.920
 said that this month is over 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.390
 only product so she was sorry to do 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 the video for a single product then ne 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 will talk in next month's video in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 this month you only have to settle for 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 I also didn't really make big 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 things finished between the products 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.520
 simple enough three simple sense 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.030
 the usual things 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 the first product of which I speak to you is the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 goodnight bath of line b and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.840
 of smile that you buy in ashley for 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.910
 now I don't know if this happened in 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.920
 all the slayers present in Italy and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.859
 out of Italy but no longer called files e 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.270
 cairn at least in bergamo is called daily 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.800
 I seem to have understood that he chooses that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.850
 has been purchased by this chain 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.170
 Austrian that is called daily e 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 it makes me very happy because I have 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 always made a terrible effort to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.259
 write the name of the chalet that the real one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.060
 part this seems to me that the products i 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.040
 the products are the same I get the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 doubt indeed for those who had 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.920
 their brand in fact the products of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 I didn't find any baby smile then 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.710
 I think they 're doing a little in return 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.290
 of sinful goods because these products 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 they don't have really good and cheap 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.619
 this if I remember correctly 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.960
 I already showed it to you in some videos 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490
 some favorites 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.400
 and finally I finished because it is a 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.470
 500 ml bottle and having a perfume 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.270
 a bit special we say that it is not 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.479
 that I used it continuously but time 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.560
 finished first of all not like you 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.840
 I said 500 ml price around 3 euros 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.830
 in short, really a trifle of ingredients 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.310
 I was told that I am enough 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.370
 these are good here in general 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.190
 baby smile line of the speedy e 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.510
 always been one of the lines from 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.560
 cheap supermarket ok so for the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.530
 my experience this is a great one 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.620
 product has a lavender fragrance not 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.320
 too pungent very delicate and has a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.610
 excellent effect also on the skin I have it 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.360
 used point for bathrooms 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.670
 relaxing in the evening and it's always me 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.790
 really liked a criminal gera e 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.900
 however the surfactant foams 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.489
 chemicals obviously leaves the skin 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.720
 delicately scented very little 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.250
 perfumed and still sells third I don't 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.560
 gives itches does not give me any kind of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.720
 problem so this is the super 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.790
 promoted I don't know if I'll buy it again 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.799
 because I don't know if I'll ever find it again 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.650
 this part 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.989
 another product 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.579
 similar but on the contrary I will not buy 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.879
 never again is actually not the one bought 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:19.390
 own voluntarily and this gel 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.090
 shower of the lawyers that I have this 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.000
 found in one of those boxes 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.069
 gift along with the juicy couture scent 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500
 and I'm passionate about the furious 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.840
 he loves it so much 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.700
 what the very first classic film 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.269
 two performers and I was given as a present 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.730
 just a box with a bottle of 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:47.409
 perfume and body cream and shower gel 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.900
 I haven't finished the body creams yet 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.540
 but I don't really struggle to use them 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.560
 because they are terrifying this not 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.659
 I can't even show you 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.720
 ingredients because they are not there perhaps 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.970
 on the original box I don't have 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.510
 own idea of ​​where it is if you are still 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.730
 in this house this is also 125 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.160
 ml but to finish it really made effort 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.410
 because the scent looks like enough 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.769
 to that of the perfume but of course 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.030
 it's not the same because I think it's one 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.130
 question of ingredients or locations 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.690
 dissolve the same inactive fragrance 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.479
 different ie obviously if you put it 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.340
 in alcohol rather than in one 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.050
 solution that must that it must become a 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.240
 bubble bath and obvious that takes one 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.099
 different fragrance this is the 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.900
 justification that I gave myself therefore 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.330
 perfume is not exactly the same though 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.840
 I don't mind but unfortunately it really is 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.669
 very aggressive as a shower gel 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.849
 by now they are used to using 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.870
 much more delicate things and this how 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:56.920
 that ritual mousse gave me 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.440
 itchy legs and therefore 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.940
 ended up just gritting her teeth because 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.170
 it annoyed me to throw it away among other things 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.710
 I have another one 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.020
 I don't know how I'll do it and so here's this 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.180
 rejected and if I could choose 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.510
 I might have bought a bottle of 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.290
 larger perfume but without body lotion 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.970
 and maybe 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.120
 in short, who gave me this gift 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.400
 I thought I'd actually like it 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.110
 because it was a nice box with between 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.430
 products looked like a beautiful thing 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.010
 actually this really is really 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:32.170
 very bad so bad and a goodbye 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.960
 other product that I finished for 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:40.960
 luck and I will not buy again and shine 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.150
 balm flowers and currant berries this 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.620
 He bought it for dull hair and 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.570
 treated 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.180
 I bought this because of how 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.530
 you know I really like bassano 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.290
 splendor at the coc as there are always 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.570
 found very well and is my balm 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.580
 emergency when I do not know what is enough 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.140
 buy are without conditioner are out 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.110
 home and I have to buy a conditioner without 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.240
 spend too much I always end up on 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.190
 sun shines ron cocco 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.470
 so it's a rock that is curious to try 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.630
 this as for the splendid coconut 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:16.510
 that is 300 ml I leave you the 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.890
 ingredients so I like that 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.150
 packaging in itself great because how 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.530
 you know I use a lot of conditioner for 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.570
 having capers 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.860
 but it is a product that proposes is not me 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.810
 liked it then first of all yes 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.620
 he presented I don't know if maybe there is still one 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:39.010
 a micro gray background: I do not know if you see no 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:41.670
 I think like a pink cream but you know the 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.800
 perfume is the consistency 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.540
 I don't know, they know I'm not fake 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.550
 like the effect on my hair 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.850
 seems to put just one then me 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:56.700
 it looks like silicones if I haven't seen it 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:58.930
 there are none 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.120
 I don't think there are any silicones 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.310
 details but the impression 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.790
 shouts and that of a fan of a balm 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.560
 very very chemical very silicone 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.960
 fake both in the scent and in the 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.180
 consistency of the cream in the effect 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.250
 which has on the hair so unlike 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.419
 of the splendor that they are a balm 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:21.330
 quite liquid and light but second 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:24.630
 me this is very effective on me not 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:27.690
 it really does have a great effect so not 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:30.780
 even if it costs that euro euro e 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:34.410
 fifty what I will not buy back 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.300
 absolutely and so this is enough 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.220
 how much I hope this video is there 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.060
 been somewhat helpful excuse me if 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.460
 as usual, leave me behind 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.470
 it has not expired but I say it only once 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:52.620
 I don't have an ironing board and I don't get it 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:55.830
 destiny and not ironing so I'm sorry 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.190
 maybe I'll put on a living Chinese screen 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.990
 better 

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.470
 I 'm not kidding, I'll keep my scarf because 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.039
 I like it all and see you here at 

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.490
 next month 

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:04.490
 Hello
