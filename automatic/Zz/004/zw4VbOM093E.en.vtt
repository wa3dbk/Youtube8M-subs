00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.690 
cornstarch into the hair until it blends
in<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:19.110> don't<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.470> any<00:02:19.620> white<00:02:19.920> parts<00:02:20.310> left

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
in we don't want any white parts left

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.570 
in we don't want any white parts left
out<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:24.540> think<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.170> especially<00:02:25.440> important<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
out I think it's especially important to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.480 
out I think it's especially important to
use<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.569> cornstarch<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> front<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
use the cornstarch in the front of the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.850 
use the cornstarch in the front of the
hair<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:30.450> where<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:30.870> hairline<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.560> going

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.480 
and you see it's a much curlier holding
pattern<00:03:30.590> then<00:03:31.930> there<00:03:32.930> was<00:03:33.200> before<00:03:36.310> we're<00:03:37.310> just

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490
