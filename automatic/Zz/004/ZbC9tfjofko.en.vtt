 quite heavy and also not shaking 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.739
 here it means some constructor and not 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:07.840

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:09.519
 all the same, what happened to us and down again 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.230
 Kitty we are very lucky because 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.389
 firstly it is kita and secondly because 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.879
 that she is not a repeat that is, this is kati 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.949
 Here is such a wonderful and this flower 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.449
 which will still need to stick 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.940
 Sticker like this Kitty should 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.800
 keep your flower for which we are not 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.570
 we will glue the sticker because all 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.000
 it is equal then with us 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.520
 spoil in order to preserve the original 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.210
 kind of toys we do not glue stickers 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.039
 often 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.199
 and so here are the houses with 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.180
 Flower Well, more precisely, this is not a house courtyard 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.250
 so let's see how it is 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.650
 looks here in his house in 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.050
 the courtyard in general looks like this 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.750
 Kita is very cool toy too 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.690
 I am very glad that I got it 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.550
 let's look at the description it looks 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.199
 here in this way and here 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.419
 just show how much should be 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.610
 these are only 8 pieces in our collection 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.080

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.030

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.000

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.930
 I was very pleased but the ball 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.099

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.960
