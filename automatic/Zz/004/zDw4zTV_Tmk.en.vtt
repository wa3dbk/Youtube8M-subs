in the deep water and you attach your

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
in the deep water and you attach your
trap<00:01:00.390> chain<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> one-way<00:01:02.010> slide

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
when the beavers caught he dives for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
when the beavers caught he dives for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
water and he slides down the rod but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
water and he slides down the rod but
given<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> angle<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:07.619> starts<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> pull

given the angle when he starts to pull
back<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.580> can't<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> really

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
construct a drowning set and it sure

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.730 
construct a drowning set and it sure

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
beats carrying a lot of weight so anyway

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.380

catching<00:03:31.910> them<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:32.570> just<00:03:33.020> it's<00:03:33.230> better<00:03:33.530> to

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
catching them it's just it's better to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.220 
catching them it's just it's better to
avoid<00:03:34.070> problems<00:03:34.790> than<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.269> build<00:03:35.660> problems

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
avoid problems than to build problems

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.340 
avoid problems than to build problems
later<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.340> that's<00:03:37.459> why<00:03:37.670> there's<00:03:37.940> no<00:03:38.120> traps<00:03:39.110> on

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
later so that's why there's no traps on

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.590 
later so that's why there's no traps on
top<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.739> dam<00:03:39.920> here<00:03:40.190> we'll<00:03:40.370> just<00:03:40.600> we'll

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
top of the dam here we'll just we'll

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.880 
top of the dam here we'll just we'll
just<00:03:41.630> see<00:03:41.900> if<00:03:41.930> we<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.200> take<00:03:42.350> care<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.680> job

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
just see if we can take care of the job

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.830 
just see if we can take care of the job
without<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.489> if<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.120> have<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.390> go<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.690> route

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
without that if I have to go that route

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.470 
without that if I have to go that route
a<00:03:44.900> will<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:45.800> uh<00:03:45.830> that's<00:03:46.310> not<00:03:46.970> what<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.180> want<00:03:47.390> to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
a will but uh that's not what I want to

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.220 
a will but uh that's not what I want to
do<00:03:47.570> right<00:03:47.750> off<00:03:48.070> also<00:03:49.070> I've<00:03:49.250> got<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.810> game<00:03:50.810> camera

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
do right off also I've got a game camera

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
do right off also I've got a game camera
set<00:03:51.500> up<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.820> right<00:03:53.060> here<00:03:53.239> now

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
set up and this is right here now

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.900 
set up and this is right here now
normally<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:54.350> I'm<00:03:54.830> long<00:03:55.100> chaining<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.670> beaver

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
normally if I'm long chaining the beaver

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.660 
normally if I'm long chaining the beaver
I<00:03:56.209> would<00:03:56.900> never<00:03:57.110> put<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.380> camera<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.220> close<00:03:58.489> to

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
I would never put a camera this close to

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.819 
I would never put a camera this close to
the<00:03:58.790> set<00:03:59.030> because<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.510> beaver<00:03:59.720> would<00:04:00.440> simply

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
the set because the beaver would simply

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.510 
the set because the beaver would simply
come<00:04:01.579> around<00:04:01.820> not

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
come around not

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.840 
come around not
camera<00:04:02.790> down<00:04:02.940> caused<00:04:03.360> all<00:04:03.570> kinds<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.020> problems

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
camera down caused all kinds of problems

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.250 
camera down caused all kinds of problems
but<00:04:05.850> since<00:04:06.060> they're<00:04:06.270> on<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> short<00:04:06.780> chain<00:04:07.050> and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
but since they're on a short chain and

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.200 
but since they're on a short chain and
they're<00:04:07.350> on<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> drowning<00:04:07.830> set<00:04:08.190> there's<00:04:08.760> no<00:04:09.000> way

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
they're on a drowning set there's no way

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.320 
they're on a drowning set there's no way
that<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> beaver<00:04:10.140> can<00:04:10.320> reach<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.700> tripod<00:04:12.150> up

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
that the beaver can reach the tripod up

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.240 
that the beaver can reach the tripod up
here<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.720> I'm<00:04:12.810> pretty<00:04:13.260> confident<00:04:13.710> about

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
here so I'm pretty confident about

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.370 
here so I'm pretty confident about
putting<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:14.610> Trump<00:04:14.880> out<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.210> here<00:04:15.360> now<00:04:16.290> we

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
putting that Trump out of here now we

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.310 
putting that Trump out of here now we
got<00:04:16.530> rain<00:04:16.770> supposed<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.190> move<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.489> tonight<00:04:17.670> and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
got rain supposed to move in tonight and

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.170 
got rain supposed to move in tonight and
so<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> don't<00:04:19.530> know<00:04:19.650> we'll<00:04:20.520> just<00:04:20.549> have<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.880> see

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
so I don't know we'll just have to see

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.670 
so I don't know we'll just have to see
but<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:22.020> a<00:04:22.110> nice<00:04:22.290> little<00:04:22.590> pond<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
but it's a nice little pond and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.050 
but it's a nice little pond and
hopefully<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.710> can<00:04:25.800> fix<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> problem<00:04:26.700> for<00:04:26.730> him

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
hopefully I can fix the problem for him

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.550 
hopefully I can fix the problem for him
so<00:04:27.990> we'll<00:04:28.140> check<00:04:28.380> it<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.940> see<00:04:29.940> what<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.210> get

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
so we'll check it and see what we get

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.940 
so we'll check it and see what we get
all<00:04:31.560> right<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:31.860> has<00:04:32.010> been<00:04:32.250> several<00:04:32.820> days<00:04:33.950> we

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
all right it has been several days we

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.630 
all right it has been several days we
had<00:04:35.100> some<00:04:35.370> heavy<00:04:35.610> rain<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.980> that<00:04:37.980> prevented<00:04:38.550> a

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
had some heavy rain and that prevented a

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.100 
had some heavy rain and that prevented a
couple<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.000> checks<00:04:39.270> because<00:04:39.510> everything<00:04:40.020> was

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
couple of checks because everything was

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.220 
couple of checks because everything was
under<00:04:40.290> water<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:41.790> came<00:04:42.450> back<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.810> next<00:04:43.080> day

under water I came back the next day

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.620 
under water I came back the next day

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
the sensitivity set right but we'll

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.260 
the sensitivity set right but we'll
we'll<00:05:25.050> see<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:26.010> let<00:05:26.310> me<00:05:26.430> let<00:05:26.790> me<00:05:26.820> get<00:05:27.000> in<00:05:27.120> there

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
he was at the very the very end there

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.600 
he was at the very the very end there
that<00:06:27.150> lock<00:06:27.890> is<00:06:29.000> right<00:06:30.000> up<00:06:30.150> against<00:06:30.540> the<00:06:30.660> stop

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
that lock is right up against the stop

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.160 
that lock is right up against the stop
so<00:06:32.610> he<00:06:32.640> rode<00:06:33.000> that<00:06:33.210> all<00:06:33.480> the<00:06:33.630> way<00:06:33.780> to<00:06:33.810> the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
so he rode that all the way to the

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.160 
so he rode that all the way to the
bottom<00:06:34.970> and<00:06:35.970> you<00:06:36.090> can<00:06:36.120> see<00:06:36.450> there's<00:06:36.690> the<00:06:36.870> bend

bottom and you can see there's the bend

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.110 
bottom and you can see there's the bend
that<00:06:37.740> I<00:06:37.800> like<00:06:38.040> to<00:06:38.190> place<00:06:38.430> in<00:06:38.640> him<00:06:38.760> for<00:06:38.940> deep

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
that I like to place in him for deep

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.070 
that I like to place in him for deep
water<00:06:39.860> right<00:06:40.860> there<00:06:41.420> so<00:06:42.420> that<00:06:42.630> was<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:42.870> part

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
water right there so that was the part

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.380 
water right there so that was the part
of<00:06:43.410> the<00:06:44.130> drowning<00:06:44.370> rod<00:06:44.580> that<00:06:44.790> was<00:06:44.880> jammed<00:06:45.240> in

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
of the drowning rod that was jammed in

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.990 
of the drowning rod that was jammed in
the<00:06:45.480> mud<00:06:45.690> and<00:06:46.880> this<00:06:47.880> part<00:06:48.240> up<00:06:48.360> here<00:06:49.640> is<00:06:50.640> what

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
the mud and this part up here is what

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.120 
the mud and this part up here is what
was<00:06:51.150> stated<00:06:51.390> down<00:06:51.690> at<00:06:51.990> the<00:06:52.140> dam<00:06:52.290> break<00:06:52.650> and

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
was stated down at the dam break and

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.260 
was stated down at the dam break and
once<00:06:53.910> they're<00:06:54.180> caught<00:06:54.750> they<00:06:55.560> slide<00:06:56.210> all<00:06:57.210> the

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
once they're caught they slide all the

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.360 
once they're caught they slide all the
way<00:06:57.480> down<00:06:57.570> down<00:06:58.440> into<00:06:58.710> the<00:06:58.800> deep<00:06:58.950> water<00:06:59.250> and

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
way down down into the deep water and

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.280 
way down down into the deep water and
then<00:06:59.760> the<00:06:59.850> lock<00:07:00.060> the<00:07:00.300> one-way<00:07:00.600> lock<00:07:00.840> won't<00:07:01.080> let

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.290 
then the lock the one-way lock won't let

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.890 
then the lock the one-way lock won't let
them<00:07:01.410> back<00:07:01.590> up<00:07:01.830> and<00:07:02.070> they're<00:07:02.970> drowned<00:07:04.070> so

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
them back up and they're drowned so

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.860 
them back up and they're drowned so
anyway<00:07:06.900> this<00:07:07.500> is<00:07:07.710> taken<00:07:08.100> about<00:07:08.610> a<00:07:08.670> week<00:07:08.970> but<00:07:09.840> I

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
anyway this is taken about a week but I

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.720 
anyway this is taken about a week but I
believe<00:07:10.140> this<00:07:10.320> is<00:07:10.380> the<00:07:10.590> last<00:07:10.620> beaver<00:07:11.130> in<00:07:11.400> here

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
believe this is the last beaver in here

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.110 
believe this is the last beaver in here
and<00:07:13.130> you<00:07:14.130> can<00:07:14.280> see<00:07:14.430> the<00:07:14.550> break<00:07:14.790> is<00:07:14.970> not

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
and you can see the break is not

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.810 
and you can see the break is not
repaired<00:07:15.740> and<00:07:16.740> this<00:07:16.920> water<00:07:17.130> level<00:07:17.490> is<00:07:17.610> way

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
repaired and this water level is way

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.600 
repaired and this water level is way
down<00:07:18.030> it<00:07:18.300> was<00:07:18.510> way<00:07:18.900> up<00:07:19.230> on<00:07:19.530> top<00:07:20.070> of<00:07:20.100> this<00:07:20.340> dam

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
down it was way up on top of this dam

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.200 
down it was way up on top of this dam
just<00:07:21.540> dropped<00:07:21.990> a<00:07:22.140> good<00:07:22.440> foot<00:07:23.220> to<00:07:23.400> 18<00:07:23.820> inches

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
just dropped a good foot to 18 inches

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.320 
just dropped a good foot to 18 inches
and<00:07:25.340> so<00:07:26.340> I<00:07:26.370> think<00:07:26.460> the<00:07:26.640> landowner<00:07:27.060> will<00:07:27.240> be

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
and so I think the landowner will be

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.170 
and so I think the landowner will be
pleased<00:07:27.630> with<00:07:27.900> this
