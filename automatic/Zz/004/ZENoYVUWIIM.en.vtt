00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.620
 what do you people from youtube sean vÃ©lez 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 this channel of shewan art game in this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.759
 chance let's see how to pass the data 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.440
 to the sd card of the games so that 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.650
 occupy less happen to be speak of white 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.539
 way of 17 25 and we're going to start with this 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.600
 tutorial the first thing we have to 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.370
 to do is go to google play and download the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 next file the next file 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.360
 it's called folder mount folder mont is a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 file that allows us to do 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.130
 simulations of transfers to the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.810
 microsd card thinking that the card 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.970
 sd you have in this android device 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.460
 this application is totally free 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.320
 how do you use that we first have to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 go to the bottom of the mouse 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.870
 then he will ask us to activate that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.820
 we are services we are or prosperous sorry 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.470
 allow the superuser service 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.120
 after this it can be a single meter 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.850
 that says our sd card can not 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.739
 be this one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.620
 is not compatible with the system that yes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.730
 we want to be compatible we should accept 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 apply a pair if after restarting to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.870
 after this we will have to go here to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.560
 section to the folder and analyzer 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.330
 Of applications 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.800
 here in the application analyzer 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.750
 give us all the most applications 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.340
 heavy to the lightest we have 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.300
 in this case I'm going to do the method 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 with an application that is very very very 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.240
 little bit in this case we're going to do it with 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.079
 what is the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.119
 what is the messenger to be 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.930
 fast they are not achieved then pinch 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.170
 about messenger and tells him to create a couple 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.090
 of folders say that if you want to create 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.610
 a folder folder that you put that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.250
 if you create the folder and give it here in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.570
 the popcorn and they say yes then 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.110
 up here from the top part 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.020
 start creating 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.940
 the double file not to be able to do the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 emulation will take a few 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.350
 instants depending on the size of your 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.490
 game presented in doing emulation 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.720
 remember for this then all the data 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.040
 they have to be the card first 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.040
 internal to be able to do this emulation 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 I have emulated what is what is in 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.880
 the nova 3 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.460
 let's see there is some side 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.130
 We completely went up, we went 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.190
 bar and here we go now to this 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.510
 paragraph that says list of couples 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.489
 here I have activated what is the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 new a3 data and also activate me 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.130
 the data of not having messenger data and 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.470
 we would be back again 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.000
 analyzer and how benasque filled up 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.349
 the month and now it has much less data 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.599
 because those data that were 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.970
 sent to the emulation of the card it 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.940
 I remade it's all people like that I'm going to teach 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.450
 is to see how much my space has 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.920
 my tablet 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 so that you can observe what 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.650
 It is not false and as you can see I have two points 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.500
 74 GB of space and only used 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.200
 in arriving with 9 and I have working the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.910
 nova 3 good people I hope you serve them 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.910
 you want to like 2 for the next goodbye
