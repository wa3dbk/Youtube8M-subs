but<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.449> doesn't<00:00:50.659> get<00:00:50.930> much<00:00:51.140> anyway<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:51.650> I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
but it doesn't get much anyway so I

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.020 
but it doesn't get much anyway so I
purchase<00:00:54.470> this<00:00:56.860> for<00:00:57.860> two<00:00:58.370> bucks

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.150 
dollars is too big here to fit into here
so<00:01:18.289> I<00:01:18.320> use<00:01:18.800> my<00:01:19.100> Spyderco<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:20.300> just<00:01:20.890> carve<00:01:21.890> the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
so I use my Spyderco to just carve the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160 
so I use my Spyderco to just carve the
soft<00:01:22.460> plastic<00:01:23.000> around<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.479> till<00:01:23.750> there<00:01:24.020> was<00:01:24.050> a

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
soft plastic around it till there was a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.660 
soft plastic around it till there was a
big<00:01:24.410> enough<00:01:24.590> opening<00:01:26.409> okay<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.159> we'll<00:01:28.310> turn<00:01:28.490> it

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
big enough opening okay so we'll turn it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:40.170 
big enough opening okay so we'll turn it
on

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.940 

okay<00:01:40.810> as<00:01:40.870> you<00:01:41.050> can<00:01:41.080> see<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.470> gets<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.770> weak

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
okay as you can see it gets a weak

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.110 
okay as you can see it gets a weak
signal<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.890> antenna<00:01:45.310> out<00:01:47.610> still<00:01:48.610> gets<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.940> weak

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
signal the antenna out still gets a weak

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.840 
signal the antenna out still gets a weak
signal<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:53.100> even<00:01:54.100> though<00:01:54.190> it's<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.430> very<00:01:54.460> nice

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
signal so even though it's a very nice

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.940 
signal so even though it's a very nice
little<00:01:55.150> thing<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.990> everything<00:01:56.650> it<00:01:56.770> really

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
little thing and everything it really

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.770 
little thing and everything it really
kind<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.370> doesn't<00:01:57.700> work<00:01:57.910> that<00:01:58.180> great<00:01:58.240> with

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
kind of doesn't work that great with

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.950 
kind of doesn't work that great with
that<00:01:58.810> antenna<00:01:59.410> until<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:01.660> take<00:02:01.930> this<00:02:02.140> adapter

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that antenna until you take this adapter

00:02:03.960 --> 00:03:04.809 
that antenna until you take this adapter
you<00:02:04.960> touch<00:02:05.260> it<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.590> your<00:02:08.910> right

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819
