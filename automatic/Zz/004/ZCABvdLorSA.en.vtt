continuing our meeting with Glen kuben
an<00:00:08.519> expert<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.360> dinosaur<00:00:09.809> footprints<00:00:10.559> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
an expert on the dinosaur footprints and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.110 
an expert on the dinosaur footprints and
some<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.040> are<00:00:11.250> three<00:00:11.460> toed<00:00:11.639> dinosaur

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
some of these are three toed dinosaur

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.610 
some of these are three toed dinosaur
footprints<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.719> he's<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.170> explain<00:00:13.469> to

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
footprints and he's going to explain to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
footprints and he's going to explain to
us<00:00:13.710> now<00:00:13.889> how<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.790> these<00:00:14.880> footprints<00:00:15.299> are

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
us now how some of these footprints are

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.679 
us now how some of these footprints are
reverse<00:00:16.199> footprints<00:00:23.269> killed<00:00:24.269> into<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
reverse footprints killed into the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.490 
reverse footprints killed into the
original<00:00:24.869> track<00:00:25.380> depressions<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.390> we

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
original track depressions and we

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.589 
original track depressions and we
determined<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> firm<00:00:29.609> clay

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
determined that it was a firm clay

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.130 
determined that it was a firm clay
that's<00:00:30.990> very<00:00:31.260> rich<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.740> iron<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.809> as<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:33.960> saw

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that's very rich in iron and as we saw

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.100 
that's very rich in iron and as we saw
in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> other<00:00:34.380> tracks<00:00:35.059> where<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
in the other tracks where it's the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.500 
in the other tracks where it's the
original<00:00:37.230> material<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> bluish-gray

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
original material is the bluish-gray

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
original material is the bluish-gray
hard<00:00:39.510> clay<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.469> where<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> oxidizes<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
hard clay but where it oxidizes on the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.569 
hard clay but where it oxidizes on the
surface<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.300> rust<00:00:42.570> essentially<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:44.100> developed

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
surface or rust essentially it developed

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
surface or rust essentially it developed
this<00:00:44.760> rusty<00:00:45.120> brown<00:00:45.390> color<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.620> other

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this rusty brown color and the other

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.080 
this rusty brown color and the other
thing<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> happens<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.789> comes

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
thing that happens is that they comes

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
thing that happens is that they comes
because<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.950> oxidation<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.250> becomes

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because of that oxidation it becomes

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.110 
because of that oxidation it becomes
harder<00:00:50.940> than<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> limestone<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
harder than the limestone and so the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.770 
harder than the limestone and so the
erosion<00:00:54.660> acts<00:00:56.030> more<00:00:57.030> severely<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
erosion acts more severely on the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
erosion acts more severely on the
limestone<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.500> essentially<00:00:59.129> eroding

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
limestone and it's essentially eroding

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
limestone and it's essentially eroding
around<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> tracks<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.899> tract<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.350> ends<00:01:01.649> up

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
around the tracks the tract and ends up

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130 
around the tracks the tract and ends up
developing<00:01:02.609> positive<00:01:03.120> relief<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.930> being

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
developing positive relief for being

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
developing positive relief for being
raised<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.890> appearance<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.270> see

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
raised in appearance so here you can see

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.640 
raised in appearance so here you can see
the<00:01:07.260> info<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.590> Majel<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.670> seems<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.180> higher

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
the info on Majel it seems to be higher

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.960 
the info on Majel it seems to be higher
it<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.740> higher<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> limestone<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it is higher than the limestone but you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
it is higher than the limestone but you
could<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> details<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.890> outline

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
could see all of the details the outline

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
could see all of the details the outline
of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> infilling<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.880> even<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> nice<00:01:15.360> sharp

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
of the infilling here even a nice sharp

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.260 
of the infilling here even a nice sharp
claw<00:01:15.990> could<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> trace<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:18.000> us<00:01:18.090> because

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
claw could you trace that for us because

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
claw could you trace that for us because
it<00:01:18.540> might<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.840> show<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.170> quite<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.619> well<00:01:19.830> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it might not show up quite as well on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
it might not show up quite as well on
the<00:01:20.729> okay<00:01:21.060> there's<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> Neva<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the okay there's the Neva this is the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.840 
the okay there's the Neva this is the
middle<00:01:22.200> toe<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:24.299> other<00:01:24.420> toe<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.960> heel<00:01:24.990> here

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
middle toe the other toe the heel here

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
middle toe the other toe the heel here
for<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> foot<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.220> I'm

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
for the back of the foot and this I'm

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.819 
for the back of the foot and this I'm
not<00:01:29.520> sure<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.710> sometimes<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
not sure what that is sometimes the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.350 
not sure what that is sometimes the
dinosaurs<00:01:32.220> will<00:01:32.369> impress<00:01:32.610> their<00:01:32.790> metatarsus

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
dinosaurs will impress their metatarsus

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
dinosaurs will impress their metatarsus
or<00:01:33.479> soul<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> heal<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.350> come<00:01:34.530> back

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
or soul and heal but it would come back

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
or soul and heal but it would come back
normally<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> we'll<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.790> on

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
normally like this and we'll see that on

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
normally like this and we'll see that on
the<00:01:36.299> next<00:01:36.420> print<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.470> build<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.799> those

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the next print so but build up those

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.179 
the next print so but build up those
three<00:01:38.159> toes<00:01:38.430> again

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.410 

there's<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.820> little<00:01:42.939> toe<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.390> claw<00:01:44.159> toe<00:01:45.159> okay<00:01:46.090> I

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
there's a little toe the claw toe okay I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.209 
there's a little toe the claw toe okay I
mean<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:46.960> can<00:01:47.110> see<00:01:47.320> them<00:01:47.500> with<00:01:47.590> my<00:01:47.649> eyes<00:01:47.920> but

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
mean I can see them with my eyes but

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.399 
mean I can see them with my eyes but
dinosaurs<00:01:48.520> actually<00:01:48.850> did<00:01:49.060> have<00:01:49.210> four<00:01:50.110> toes

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
dinosaurs actually did have four toes

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
dinosaurs actually did have four toes
three<00:01:50.740> large<00:01:50.950> ones<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.369> smaller<00:01:51.610> one<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
three large ones and the smaller one and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.029 
three large ones and the smaller one and
some<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.200> trucks<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.619> line<00:01:53.770> with<00:01:53.950> this

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
some of the trucks in line with this

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.730 
some of the trucks in line with this
show<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.610> fourth<00:01:54.909> bar<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.450> helix<00:01:55.810> just<00:01:56.590> show

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
show that fourth bar the helix just show

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.700 
show that fourth bar the helix just show
that<00:01:56.770> when<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.189> moisten<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.030> tracks

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that when you moisten the tracks

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.319 
that when you moisten the tracks
sometimes<00:01:59.710> the<00:02:00.070> coloration<00:02:00.610> features<00:02:01.119> show

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
sometimes the coloration features show

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.330 
sometimes the coloration features show
up<00:02:01.390> even<00:02:01.569> before<00:02:02.039> dramatically<00:02:03.039> but<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
up even before dramatically but the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.080 
up even before dramatically but the
lightest<00:02:04.000> now<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:06.610> see<00:02:06.759> some<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
lightest now let's see some of the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.790 
lightest now let's see some of the
others<00:02:07.299> here<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.319> interesting<00:02:08.470> because

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
others here this is interesting because

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.780 
others here this is interesting because
here<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.390> dinosaur<00:02:10.869> has<00:02:10.989> put<00:02:11.519> weight<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
here the dinosaur has put weight on the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.180 
here the dinosaur has put weight on the
back<00:02:12.910> part<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.300> foot<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.810> metatarsus<00:02:14.470> and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
back part of the foot the metatarsus and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.210 
back part of the foot the metatarsus and
so<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.209> get<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.510> long<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.840> its<00:02:16.870> shape<00:02:17.230> but

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
so you get it so long in its shape but

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.240 
so you get it so long in its shape but
you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.459> still<00:02:18.640> see<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.000> three<00:02:19.209> toes<00:02:20.250> again

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
you can still see the three toes again

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.100 
you can still see the three toes again
it's<00:02:21.400> well<00:02:21.610> infilled<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.299> becoming<00:02:22.870> raised

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
it's well infilled is becoming raised

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.900 
it's well infilled is becoming raised
because<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> limestone<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.280> eroding<00:02:24.610> around

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
because the limestone is eroding around

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.140 
because the limestone is eroding around
the<00:02:25.690> heart<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.319> filling<00:02:26.560> material<00:02:27.150> so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the heart and in filling material so

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.030 
the heart and in filling material so
it's<00:02:28.299> possible<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.049> lot<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.440> these<00:02:29.530> lumps

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
it's possible but a lot of these lumps

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.759 
it's possible but a lot of these lumps
that<00:02:30.069> we<00:02:30.340> see<00:02:30.549> in<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.090> river<00:02:31.420> right<00:02:32.019> basin<00:02:32.620> may

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
that we see in the river right basin may

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.650 
that we see in the river right basin may
actually<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.370> raised<00:02:33.760> footprints<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.540> we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
actually be raised footprints that we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.120 
actually be raised footprints that we
just<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:35.079> not<00:02:35.260> we've<00:02:35.560> determined<00:02:35.829> many

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
just have not we've determined many

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.309 
just have not we've determined many
cases<00:02:36.579> you<00:02:37.269> can<00:02:37.299> get<00:02:37.510> clues<00:02:37.780> because<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
cases you can get clues because the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.610 
cases you can get clues because the
infill<00:02:38.560> material<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.130> smoother<00:02:40.620> clay-like

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
infill material is a smoother clay-like

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.520 
infill material is a smoother clay-like
material<00:02:41.829> that<00:02:42.519> has<00:02:43.019> not<00:02:44.019> as<00:02:44.140> do<00:02:44.230> gruff<00:02:44.440> a

material that has not as do gruff a
texture<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.190> limestone<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:46.359> whenever<00:02:46.690> you

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
texture as the limestone so whenever you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.170 
texture as the limestone so whenever you
see<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.470> raised<00:02:48.010> mound<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:48.880> see<00:02:49.000> some

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
see a raised mound and you see some

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.370 
see a raised mound and you see some
smoother<00:02:49.540> types<00:02:49.720> you'd<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:49.989> right<00:02:50.140> here

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
smoother types you'd like right here

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.490 
smoother types you'd like right here
these<00:02:50.920> are<00:02:50.980> two<00:02:51.130> toes<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.670> track<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
these are two toes of a track and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.620 
these are two toes of a track and
sometimes<00:02:53.739> if<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.519> wet<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.269> often

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
sometimes if you if you wet it and often

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.090 
sometimes if you if you wet it and often
there's<00:02:55.810> algae<00:02:56.019> that's<00:02:56.350> encrusted<00:02:56.859> on<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
there's algae that's encrusted on the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.099 
there's algae that's encrusted on the
track<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.579> when<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.790> clean<00:02:58.420> off<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.690> algae

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
track and when you clean off the algae

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.650 
track and when you clean off the algae
the<00:02:59.920> tape<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.549> toes<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.120> rusty<00:03:01.450> brown

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the tape of the toes and the rusty brown

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.770 
the tape of the toes and the rusty brown
color<00:03:02.040> or<00:03:03.040> worse<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.459> oxidized<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.209> great

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
color or worse not oxidized the great

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.220 
color or worse not oxidized the great
blue<00:03:05.109> color<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:06.750> unfortunately<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> light<00:03:08.079> is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
blue color so unfortunately the light is

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.949 
blue color so unfortunately the light is
pretty<00:03:08.350> partial<00:03:08.829> right<00:03:08.950> now<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.690> then<00:03:10.810> in

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
pretty partial right now and then in

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.530 
pretty partial right now and then in
line<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.350> these<00:03:11.440> same<00:03:11.680> tracks<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.220> have

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
line with these same tracks we have

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.849 
line with these same tracks we have
another<00:03:13.540> truck<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.170> has<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.350> partial

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
another truck that has a partial

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.309 
another truck that has a partial
metatarsus<00:03:15.459> impression<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.720> here<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:17.109> see

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
metatarsus impression but here you see

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.319 
metatarsus impression but here you see
that<00:03:17.560> fourth<00:03:17.859> digit<00:03:18.220> actually<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
that fourth digit actually it's the

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.699 
that fourth digit actually it's the
first<00:03:19.359> digit<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.930> foot<00:03:20.139> of<00:03:20.230> corresponds

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
first digit on the foot of corresponds

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.460 
first digit on the foot of corresponds
to<00:03:20.980> your<00:03:21.519> big<00:03:21.700> toe<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.239> dinosaur<00:03:22.750> it's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
to your big toe but on a dinosaur it's

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.319 
to your big toe but on a dinosaur it's
the<00:03:23.829> it's<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.489> quite<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.790> bit<00:03:24.940> smaller<00:03:24.970> than

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
the it's it's quite a bit smaller than

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.270 
the it's it's quite a bit smaller than
the<00:03:25.420> other<00:03:25.510> digits<00:03:26.440> that's<00:03:26.560> normally<00:03:26.950> when

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
the other digits that's normally when

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.430 
the other digits that's normally when
the<00:03:27.370> dinosaurs<00:03:27.760> walking<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.329> held<00:03:28.540> off<00:03:29.230> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
the dinosaurs walking it's held off to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.650 
the dinosaurs walking it's held off to
the<00:03:29.530> side<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.069> towards<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.790> back<00:03:30.970> but

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
the side and then towards the back but

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.789 
the side and then towards the back but
when<00:03:31.780> he<00:03:31.840> puts<00:03:32.049> weight<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.410> back<00:03:32.560> part<00:03:32.739> of

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
when he puts weight on the back part of

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.340 
when he puts weight on the back part of
the<00:03:32.889> foot<00:03:32.920> then<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.340> gets<00:03:33.489> impressed<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.350> even

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
the foot then it gets impressed and even

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.870 
the foot then it gets impressed and even
then<00:03:35.500> sometimes<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.010> mud<00:03:36.160> comes<00:03:36.370> back<00:03:36.579> over

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
then sometimes the mud comes back over

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.150 
then sometimes the mud comes back over
it<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.209> case<00:03:37.269> we<00:03:37.630> see<00:03:37.950> several<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.130> a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
it but in this case we see several in a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.949 
it but in this case we see several in a
row<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.609> show<00:03:39.849> this<00:03:40.000> minotaurs<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.720> mean<00:03:40.840> this

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
row that show this minotaurs I mean this

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.640 
row that show this minotaurs I mean this
helix<00:03:42.060> impression<00:03:43.060> okay<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:43.930> that's<00:03:44.200> what<00:03:44.380> on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
helix impression okay so that's what on

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.839 
helix impression okay so that's what on
this<00:03:44.829> would<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.250> big<00:03:45.400> toe<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.700> it's

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
this would be the big toe is it's

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.430 
this would be the big toe is it's
actually<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.329> smallest<00:03:46.569> up<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.109> big<00:03:47.260> toe

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
actually the smallest up to the big toe

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.229 
actually the smallest up to the big toe
of<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.590> dinosaur<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.340> yeah<00:03:48.579> towards<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.060> back

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
of a dinosaur it's yeah towards the back

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:49.559 
of a dinosaur it's yeah towards the back
and

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
and

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.500 
and
take<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.900> back<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:50.709> here<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.519> see<00:03:51.730> it's<00:03:52.390> all

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
take it back and here you see it's all

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.209 
take it back and here you see it's all
just<00:03:52.749> on<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.989> inside<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.469> foot<00:03:53.650> here's

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
just on the inside of the foot here's

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.520 
just on the inside of the foot here's
the<00:03:54.280> next<00:03:54.579> step<00:03:54.819> that's<00:03:54.939> the<00:03:55.120> left<00:03:55.359> and<00:03:55.900> here's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
the next step that's the left and here's

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.080 
the next step that's the left and here's
the<00:03:56.680> right<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.370> see<00:03:57.549> again<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:57.909> on<00:03:57.999> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
the right you see again it's on the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.149 
the right you see again it's on the
inside<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.480> foot<00:03:58.629> that's<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.959> helix<00:03:59.319> that's

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
inside the foot that's the helix that's

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.520 
inside the foot that's the helix that's
part<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.670> metatarsus<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:02.109> of<00:04:02.230> course<00:04:02.439> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
part of the metatarsus and of course the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.140 
part of the metatarsus and of course the
three<00:04:02.709> toes<00:04:02.950> again<00:04:03.730> it's<00:04:03.969> completely

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
three toes again it's completely

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.699 
three toes again it's completely
unfilled<00:04:04.749> and<00:04:04.870> because<00:04:05.170> didn't<00:04:05.379> filling<00:04:05.620> us

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
unfilled and because didn't filling us

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.990 
unfilled and because didn't filling us
rusted<00:04:06.159> and<00:04:06.219> become<00:04:06.489> harder<00:04:06.819> than<00:04:06.939> the

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
rusted and become harder than the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.289 
rusted and become harder than the
limestone<00:04:07.180> they<00:04:08.400> roast<00:04:09.400> it's<00:04:09.670> rotating

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
limestone they roast it's rotating

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.379 
limestone they roast it's rotating
around<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.719> track<00:04:10.930> around<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.709> infilling<00:04:11.980> in

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
around the track around the infilling in

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.869 
around the track around the infilling in
causing<00:04:13.389> the<00:04:13.450> tract<00:04:13.719> up<00:04:13.900> here<00:04:14.049> raised<00:04:14.879> now

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
causing the tract up here raised now

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.529 
causing the tract up here raised now
usually<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.479> don't<00:04:16.720> see<00:04:16.989> they<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:18.539> fourth

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
usually you don't see they the fourth

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.589 
usually you don't see they the fourth
toe<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.500> helix<00:04:21.009> because<00:04:21.190> it's<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.360> little

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
toe the helix because it's a little

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.360 
toe the helix because it's a little
higher<00:04:22.720> than<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:22.990> others<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:23.259> the<00:04:23.590> gunfire<00:04:24.130> so

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
higher than the others so the gunfire so

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.650 
higher than the others so the gunfire so
he's<00:04:24.699> walking<00:04:25.030> on<00:04:25.090> his<00:04:25.180> clothes<00:04:25.449> as<00:04:25.630> they

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
he's walking on his clothes as they

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.320 
he's walking on his clothes as they
normally<00:04:26.080> do<00:04:26.259> it's<00:04:26.860> often<00:04:27.190> not<00:04:27.310> impressed<00:04:27.759> or

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
normally do it's often not impressed or

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.909 
normally do it's often not impressed or
if<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.539> doesn't<00:04:28.840> press<00:04:29.020> because<00:04:29.440> it's<00:04:29.620> small

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
if it doesn't press because it's small

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.529 
if it doesn't press because it's small
the<00:04:30.190> mud<00:04:30.340> will<00:04:30.520> often<00:04:30.789> come<00:04:30.940> back<00:04:31.090> over<00:04:31.300> this

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
the mud will often come back over this

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.930 
the mud will often come back over this
helix<00:04:32.470> impression<00:04:33.039> well<00:04:33.669> here<00:04:33.789> you<00:04:33.880> see

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
helix impression well here you see

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.260 
helix impression well here you see
several<00:04:34.419> in<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.599> row<00:04:34.660> that's<00:04:34.960> short<00:04:36.270> that's

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
several in a row that's short that's

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.680 
several in a row that's short that's
very<00:04:37.509> good<00:04:38.340> now<00:04:39.340> point<00:04:39.580> out<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.880> fourth<00:04:40.509> toe

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
very good now point out the fourth toe

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.990 
very good now point out the fourth toe
again<00:04:40.930> right<00:04:41.500> yeah<00:04:41.800> well<00:04:42.190> it's<00:04:42.370> corresponds

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
again right yeah well it's corresponds

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.370 
again right yeah well it's corresponds
actually<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.479> first<00:04:43.690> digit<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:44.110> there<00:04:44.259> it

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
actually to the first digit but there it

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.620 
actually to the first digit but there it
is<00:04:44.470> okay<00:04:45.039> right<00:04:45.430> there<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:45.820> sometimes<00:04:46.240> again

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
is okay right there and sometimes again

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.390 
is okay right there and sometimes again
when<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.810> wet<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.229> can<00:04:47.380> see<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> island

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
when you wet it you can see the island

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.839 
when you wet it you can see the island
where<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.300> that's<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:50.080> there<00:04:50.259> the<00:04:50.410> helix

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
where is it that's it there the helix

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.760 
where is it that's it there the helix
and<00:04:51.849> the<00:04:51.940> three<00:04:52.150> larger<00:04:52.479> toes<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:53.410> often

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
and the three larger toes this often

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.700 
and the three larger toes this often
these<00:04:53.860> types<00:04:54.130> of<00:04:54.280> tracks<00:04:54.490> are<00:04:54.699> called<00:04:55.710> tri

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
these types of tracks are called tri

these types of tracks are called tri
diagonal<00:04:56.979> tracks<00:04:57.310> meaning<00:04:57.639> three<00:04:57.909> toed<00:04:58.229> but

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
diagonal tracks meaning three toed but

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.390 
diagonal tracks meaning three toed but
there<00:04:59.380> are<00:04:59.500> different<00:04:59.800> types<00:04:59.830> of<00:05:00.070> three<00:05:00.220> toe

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
there are different types of three toe

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.649 
there are different types of three toe
tracks<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:00.909> the<00:05:00.970> pluck<00:05:01.180> see<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.419> most<00:05:01.599> common

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
tracks and the pluck see the most common

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.499 
tracks and the pluck see the most common
type<00:05:02.139> is<00:05:02.409> a<00:05:03.159> theropod<00:05:03.849> or<00:05:04.090> two-legged

in<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.199> area<00:05:08.970> then<00:05:09.970> there<00:05:10.120> are<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.270> few<00:05:10.419> cases

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
in the area then there are a few cases

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.719 
in the area then there are a few cases
of<00:05:11.169> ornithopod<00:05:12.039> tracks<00:05:12.340> made<00:05:12.580> by<00:05:12.699> a

two-legged<00:05:13.270> plant<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.960> do<00:05:14.050> they<00:05:14.199> have<00:05:14.320> wider

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
two-legged plant to do they have wider

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.540 
two-legged plant to do they have wider
prints<00:05:15.970> with<00:05:16.330> blunter<00:05:16.690> digits<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:18.099> then

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
prints with blunter digits and then

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.129 
prints with blunter digits and then
there<00:05:18.820> are<00:05:18.909> some<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.180> these<00:05:19.240> metatarsal

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
there are some of these metatarsal

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.499 
there are some of these metatarsal
tracks<00:05:20.440> where<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.400> metatarsus<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.060> very<00:05:22.270> long

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.089 
that we now think might be made by
another<00:05:24.940> type<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.240> dinosaur<00:05:25.419> an<00:05:25.720> ornithomimus

another type of dinosaur an ornithomimus

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.680 
another type of dinosaur an ornithomimus
and<00:05:27.099> of<00:05:27.190> course<00:05:27.430> we<00:05:27.639> also<00:05:27.789> have<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.449> fourth

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
and of course we also have the fourth

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.899 
and of course we also have the fourth
type<00:05:28.930> which<00:05:29.169> are<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.409> big<00:05:29.729> sauropod<00:05:30.729> have

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
type which are the big sauropod have

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.420 
type which are the big sauropod have
brought<00:05:31.090> us<00:05:31.180> are<00:05:31.330> like<00:05:31.509> tracks<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:33.009> back<00:05:33.219> feet

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.740 
brought us are like tracks the back feet
look<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:33.729> giant<00:05:34.060> bear<00:05:34.210> tracks<00:05:34.509> and<00:05:34.690> the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
look like giant bear tracks and the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
going on at the time this was made

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.649 
going on at the time this was made
they're<00:05:39.370> mostly<00:05:39.639> three<00:05:39.940> toed<00:05:40.150> dinosaur

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
they're mostly three toed dinosaur

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.920 
they're mostly three toed dinosaur
tracks<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.229> there<00:05:42.219> are<00:05:42.580> no<00:05:43.240> or<00:05:43.479> perhaps<00:05:43.509> only

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
one sauropod track here is that correct

traveling<00:05:57.030> in<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.180> herd<00:05:57.360> but<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.170> ones<00:05:58.350> that

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
traveling in a herd but the ones that

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.590 
traveling in a herd but the ones that
the<00:05:59.160> three<00:05:59.340> toe<00:05:59.490> dinosaurs<00:05:59.970> that<00:06:00.090> were<00:06:00.210> here

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
the three toe dinosaurs that were here

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.930 
the three toe dinosaurs that were here
were<00:06:01.320> not<00:06:01.500> necessarily<00:06:02.010> hunting<00:06:02.610> or<00:06:02.730> at<00:06:02.790> least

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
were not necessarily hunting or at least

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.670 
were not necessarily hunting or at least
they<00:06:03.090> weren't<00:06:03.240> hunting<00:06:03.600> sauropods<00:06:04.320> they<00:06:04.620> were

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
they weren't hunting sauropods they were

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.100 
they weren't hunting sauropods they were
doing<00:06:04.980> where<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:05.940> theropod<00:06:06.480> seems<00:06:06.780> to<00:06:06.900> have

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
doing where the theropod seems to have

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.960 
doing where the theropod seems to have
been<00:06:07.260> following<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:08.100> sauropod<00:06:08.520> perhaps

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
been following the sauropod perhaps

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.500 
been following the sauropod perhaps
chasing<00:06:09.420> it<00:06:09.650> but<00:06:10.650> in<00:06:10.740> most<00:06:10.890> cases<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.610> Rito

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
chasing it but in most cases the Rito

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.580 
chasing it but in most cases the Rito
tracks<00:06:12.840> are<00:06:13.020> going<00:06:13.170> in<00:06:13.380> all<00:06:13.470> different

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
tracks are going in all different

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.830 
tracks are going in all different
directions<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.640> question<00:06:15.000> would<00:06:15.120> be<00:06:15.180> what

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
directions so the question would be what

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.640 
directions so the question would be what
are<00:06:15.960> they<00:06:16.050> doing<00:06:16.320> here<00:06:16.440> if<00:06:16.500> they're<00:06:16.620> not

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
are they doing here if they're not

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.980 
are they doing here if they're not
hunting<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.100> sauropods<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:17.880> one<00:06:18.570> idea<00:06:18.870> is

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
hunting the sauropods and one idea is

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.320 
hunting the sauropods and one idea is
that<00:06:19.020> they're<00:06:19.530> looking<00:06:20.400> for<00:06:20.730> other<00:06:20.880> things<00:06:20.940> to

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
that they're looking for other things to

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.600 
that they're looking for other things to
eat<00:06:21.360> and<00:06:21.510> smaller<00:06:22.110> creatures<00:06:22.410> in<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.430> motor

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
eat and smaller creatures in the motor

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.050 
eat and smaller creatures in the motor
shell<00:06:23.910> and<00:06:24.060> water<00:06:24.210> like<00:06:24.420> fish<00:06:24.710> snails<00:06:25.710> clams

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
shell and water like fish snails clams

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.250 
shell and water like fish snails clams
but<00:06:27.060> basically<00:06:27.450> they<00:06:27.660> would<00:06:27.750> have<00:06:27.900> a<00:06:27.960> seafood

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
but basically they would have a seafood

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.560 
but basically they would have a seafood
buffet<00:06:28.560> when<00:06:28.710> the<00:06:28.800> tide<00:06:28.980> would<00:06:29.340> go<00:06:29.490> out<00:06:29.640> all

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
buffet when the tide would go out all

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.360 
buffet when the tide would go out all
kinds<00:06:30.840> of<00:06:30.900> things<00:06:31.110> because<00:06:31.380> this<00:06:31.770> was<00:06:31.950> part<00:06:31.980> of

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
kinds of things because this was part of

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.860 
kinds of things because this was part of
the<00:06:32.460> Gulf<00:06:32.640> of<00:06:32.760> Mexico<00:06:33.210> edge<00:06:33.390> of<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:33.600> Gulf<00:06:33.750> of

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
impress tracks are so common I one idea

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.620 
impress tracks are so common I one idea
I<00:06:41.190> have<00:06:41.460> is<00:06:41.550> that<00:06:41.700> the<00:06:41.850> reason<00:06:42.180> they're

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
I have is that the reason they're

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.780 
I have is that the reason they're
impressing<00:06:43.080> their<00:06:43.200> heels<00:06:43.410> at<00:06:43.620> time<00:06:43.800> is<00:06:44.490> that

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
impressing their heels at time is that

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.970 
impressing their heels at time is that
they're<00:06:44.940> getting<00:06:45.060> low<00:06:45.360> to<00:06:46.170> forward<00:06:46.560> your<00:06:46.740> feet

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
they're getting low to forward your feet

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.370 
they're getting low to forward your feet
on<00:06:47.190> small<00:06:47.760> ah<00:06:48.060> creatures<00:06:48.810> in<00:06:48.930> the<00:06:48.990> water<00:06:49.080> shell

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
on small ah creatures in the water shell

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.470 
on small ah creatures in the water shell
water<00:06:49.590> if<00:06:49.980> you're<00:06:50.130> up<00:06:50.250> on<00:06:50.340> your<00:06:50.490> toes<00:06:50.700> with

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
water if you're up on your toes with

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.030 
water if you're up on your toes with
most<00:06:51.690> dinosaurs<00:06:51.930> normally<00:06:52.350> are<00:06:52.470> and<00:06:52.740> then<00:06:52.920> you

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
most dinosaurs normally are and then you

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.590 
most dinosaurs normally are and then you
drown<00:06:53.250> sit<00:06:53.460> down<00:06:53.580> even<00:06:53.820> a<00:06:53.880> little<00:06:53.910> bit<00:06:54.180> you

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
drown sit down even a little bit you

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.060 
drown sit down even a little bit you
almost<00:06:54.810> have<00:06:55.020> to<00:06:55.200> impress<00:06:55.410> your<00:06:55.560> heels<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:56.010> I

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
almost have to impress your heels and I

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.560 
almost have to impress your heels and I
think<00:06:56.280> that's<00:06:56.400> what's<00:06:56.610> going<00:06:56.640> on<00:06:56.940> I<00:06:57.060> see<00:06:57.360> so

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
think that's what's going on I see so

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.910 
think that's what's going on I see so
that's<00:06:57.750> another<00:06:58.050> example<00:06:58.230> of<00:06:58.590> how<00:06:58.680> you<00:06:58.740> can

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:58.920 
that's another example of how you can

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.590 
that's another example of how you can
tell<00:06:59.070> something<00:06:59.400> about<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.730> Living<00:07:00.000> ecology

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
tell something about the Living ecology

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.120 
tell something about the Living ecology
of<00:07:00.630> what<00:07:00.870> was<00:07:00.990> going<00:07:01.140> on<00:07:01.320> rather<00:07:01.830> than<00:07:02.010> just

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
of what was going on rather than just

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.480 
of what was going on rather than just
the<00:07:02.430> shape<00:07:02.670> of<00:07:02.700> the<00:07:03.120> foot<00:07:03.600> or<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:04.490> evidence

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
the shape of the foot or the evidence

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.100 
the shape of the foot or the evidence
that<00:07:05.790> the<00:07:05.910> dinosaurs<00:07:06.330> were<00:07:06.420> here<00:07:06.870> you<00:07:06.990> can

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
that the dinosaurs were here you can

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:14.030 
that the dinosaurs were here you can
tell<00:07:07.290> what<00:07:07.440> they<00:07:07.530> were<00:07:07.650> doing<00:07:12.230> walking<00:07:13.230> so

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
tell what they were doing walking so

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.260 
tell what they were doing walking so
whenever<00:07:14.250> you're<00:07:14.430> studying<00:07:14.580> dinosaur<00:07:15.000> tracks

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
whenever you're studying dinosaur tracks

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.810 
whenever you're studying dinosaur tracks
it's<00:07:15.660> it's<00:07:16.320> interesting<00:07:17.250> to<00:07:17.460> try<00:07:17.580> and<00:07:17.670> figure

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
it's it's interesting to try and figure

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.950 
it's it's interesting to try and figure
out<00:07:17.910> exactly<00:07:18.090> what<00:07:18.390> they<00:07:18.480> were<00:07:18.540> doing<00:07:18.870> how

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
out exactly what they were doing how

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.660 
out exactly what they were doing how
they<00:07:19.080> were<00:07:19.140> interacting<00:07:19.380> unlike<00:07:20.160> bones<00:07:20.430> which

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
they were interacting unlike bones which

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.460 
they were interacting unlike bones which
reduce<00:07:20.880> their<00:07:21.030> debt<00:07:21.120> remains<00:07:21.480> tracks<00:07:22.260> there

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
reduce their debt remains tracks there

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.810 
reduce their debt remains tracks there
are<00:07:22.560> record<00:07:22.860> of<00:07:22.980> their<00:07:23.130> living<00:07:23.430> behavior

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
are record of their living behavior

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.250 
are record of their living behavior
which<00:07:24.000> is<00:07:24.030> well<00:07:24.360> I<00:07:24.390> wanted<00:07:24.750> me<00:07:24.840> tonight<00:07:25.080> find
