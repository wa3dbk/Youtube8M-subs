00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.510
 hi to all and often time we get 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.320
 find point gameplay with the hard kit 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.240
 mouth 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.530
 and yes I put a little suspense 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.020
 since you were not sick to me 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.340
 ask ten years ago that I have to 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.260
 ask something at shot 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.880
 I never asked someone 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.300
 you tested on it's an assault is this 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.230
 that it's anything good in the end the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
 did m 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
 some are aware that yes 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.780
 I had the pp10 with the hard she 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.540
 can shout clothes that go with a 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.540
 tried to buy for dogs 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.500
 therefore has here so we lost again b 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.679
 so already the pp 19 is a weapon more 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.020
 I think if for me I think he does not 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:16.700
 does not do enough damage 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.590
 that is to say it is hardly if you type 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.060
 someone normally it'll do a little 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.460
 less than twenty damage so 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.789
 it's for people that or shoot from afar 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.200
 it's really hard to press that 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.390
 almost put them a dozen 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.140
 balls for them to die again they 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.140
 have trouble dying 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.110
 the bar what there is no reason 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.630
 so it's not marked on server 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.610
 not big rpg me I'll use it it's 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.000
 for Sir killed by straighter MK1 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:53.619
 after I you may want you evil 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.960
 we have a prayer housecat horgen who will 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.690
 happen that I will try to unlock 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 but I have almost a level to pass 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:11.520
 so it's going to be a long time venerable ivey 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.520
 degenerate look 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.260
 so look 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.150
 I can but still the guy 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.900
 I was trying to burst is over 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.060
 with a little hindsight of the pp 19/16 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.620
 impossible to pull a guy so far I 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.330
 would say after you have the plan b rather 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.520
 the air plan which consists of taking the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.780
 rpg and exposed the guys like that I 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.010
 reassures you for all those who had 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.170
 a doubt I had not seen the guy 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.330
 it's just a stroke of luck and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.350
 same for shooting the sonos com it was 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.350
 just the chain 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.060
 I have no father not too it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.620
 I think he uses a guy who goes 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.950
 to arrive by the nÃ®moise plus a lot of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.950
 cities have 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.700
 there I thought I had recharged 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.680
 yeah from behind 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.650
 still, I made a good start 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.350
 it's okay it's not yet for av 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.850
 I loved so much that in pl it is a 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.530
 movement of my mouse that made me the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.530
 on the left why did I do that 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.580
 one shot and normally there were three 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.830
 dudes it's not where is the third 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.140
 I hope he does not wait then in 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.500
 the art kit mouth since I was good 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 gone with the crude us only he was the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 third way there or see him she 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.530
 you have the pp and 19 you have with that 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.460
 the large capacity lacrosse charger 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.230
 stabilize their fast to the reds in the 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.460
 rap that was blocking the otra I do not know 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.350
 how is enough like that is pronounced 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:22.390
 by the afutt me I take the damage 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.390
 know that this opinion abhors 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.740
 a little too quirky to open my own 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.740
 body 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.070
 there too then there me it's more in 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.390
 the arms all doublets 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.360
 after the no brass band clothes 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.070
 north not look at my clothes that 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.340
 fame save from the guy who even wanted that 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.510
 you did not like believed my words that you're 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.430
 well it's a bit of the blow of the towel 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.070
 ice cream we know it sweeps all 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.450
 the screen is to avoid a guy who 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.050
 mostly works that guy there he 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.900
 looked determined who said nothing to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.100
 least I followed and the but just as 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.820
 listen to pharmacy box there it is for 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.820
 what are they going with what 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.780
 extensive vachon fixed hours campo 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.010
 it's a knowledge to change 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.740
 and especially what surprised me when in 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.950
 the article because I compare them 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.270
 with the other one leaves the mp5 it has not me 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.250
 more in the p5 is that there was no 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.180
 from viewfinder do it there was the viewfinder 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.600
 holographic 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.500
 I prefer the red dot but here but 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.760
 after that there was also he's the 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.490
 destiny that was a bit more expensive 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.200
 it was not too embarrassing that and 1000 fund 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.440
 in addition but it is especially that the art 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.690
 that she does not have a gun that has me a 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.390
 not disappointed because he looked pretty good 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.990
 but I can you are more tracks or 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.070
 after that it was really and who 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.600
 is not too embarrassing because it's 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.530
 compensated by the sixty three bullets 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.330
 of the pp more than any of the edges of the 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.770
 surprises and the one you have more than 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.680
 bullets you take your father you 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:15.259
 challenge you do not shit 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.669

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.860

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.620
 aulas I follow or in my video 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.900

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.240
 discreet with his piano the pp 2000 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.880

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:46.419
 run like that in record time 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.690
 to the seven doublets yeah I could 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.949
