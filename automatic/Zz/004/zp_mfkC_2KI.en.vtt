 Hello everyone in this lesson I will tell you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.950
 how to make glass minecraft for 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.009
 glass production to us first 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:22.350
 will need sand sand is very easy 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:25.010
 mined shovel on me flooded well 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.010
 nothing terrible 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.960
 in principle, this is enough for us 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 sand production we need a stove 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.570
 into the stove 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.010
 we preload fuel 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 charcoal planks and wood anything and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:53.040
 put on the smelter sand glass top 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.830
 sand melting is obtained 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.010
 sand when heated it and in the present 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:03.150
 life and in the world of minecraft turns into 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.840
 glass as we see it as an arrow 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 remelting reaches the end we get 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 glass on the idea this glass can still 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 turn the glass panel for this 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.720

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.910

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.330
