00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.509
 this is one of the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.509
 with this 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.350
 and well then as one is so 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.350
 used to before 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.420
 and that he did not have so much control of the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.130
 motorcycle 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 of the decisions to take whatever 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.500
 then get used to it I think that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 a nice the one to retake the sport and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.739
 things you want to fulfill 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.739
 I do not think 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.000
 a sport that touches the pocket of 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.550
 anyone and for ernesto was not the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.629
 exception if I'm already relatively 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.720
 I think that the truth, seeing it 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.550
 well it's pretty simple but I think that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.690
 the hoops as they are should coal and everything 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.450
 if they are if they are quite expensive 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.520
 but good and I think that after 9 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.010
 how well to study it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.960
 I could be on the street but 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.520
 more or less with source you can touch on 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.020
 the pocket to buy one of these 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.630
 five thousand dollars costs more expensive because 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.640
 it's a little more complicated as it says 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.799
 Ernesto is quite lucky because 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.899
 thanks to your work you can afford this 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.929
 new passion since he works for a 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.929
 company 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.030
 motocross uniform 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.030
 a protection technique 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.710
 Well, if they are really 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.870
 I work hard here in my house 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.500
 the manager of Central America so 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.500
 with the environment 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.500
 It's not that complicated 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.870
 Bless
