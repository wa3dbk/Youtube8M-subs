00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
because it creates a very very smooth

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.310 
because it creates a very very smooth
canvas<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:11.370> skin<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.630> also<00:00:12.809> gets<00:00:13.170> rid

canvas on my skin and it also gets rid

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.010 
canvas on my skin and it also gets rid
of<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> shine<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.240> my<00:00:15.389> t-zone<00:00:15.660> area

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
of the shine going on on my t-zone area

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.800 
of the shine going on on my t-zone area
because<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.920> combination<00:00:17.220> skin<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.180> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
because I have combination skin and it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.590 
because I have combination skin and it
also<00:00:18.990> does<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.980> good<00:00:20.310> job<00:00:20.369> hiding<00:00:21.060> my

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
also does a very good job hiding my

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:46.110 
also does a very good job hiding my
pores<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:23.130> area<00:00:23.519> right<00:00:23.880> here

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.290 

so<00:00:46.690> now<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:46.900> we<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.560> very<00:00:47.890> smooth<00:00:48.340> canvas

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
so now that we have a very smooth canvas

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.930 
so now that we have a very smooth canvas
we<00:00:49.510> move<00:00:49.750> on<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.230> foundation<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:51.280> my<00:00:51.460> favorite

Revlon<00:00:53.920> nearly<00:00:54.280> naked<00:00:54.520> foundation<00:00:55.450> and<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:56.050> am

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
Revlon nearly naked foundation and I am

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.040 
Revlon nearly naked foundation and I am
in<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.440> shade<00:00:56.650> of<00:00:57.030> 170<00:00:58.030> true<00:00:58.420> beige

in the shade of 170 true beige

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.350 
in the shade of 170 true beige
I<00:00:59.080> like<00:00:59.800> this<00:00:59.950> foundation<00:01:00.340> because<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.000> really

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
I like this foundation because it really

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.900 
I like this foundation because it really
gives<00:01:01.630> an<00:01:01.900> awesome<00:01:02.379> coverage<00:01:02.949> and<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.489> doesn't

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
gives an awesome coverage and it doesn't

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.420 
gives an awesome coverage and it doesn't
feel<00:01:04.059> very<00:01:04.479> heavy<00:01:04.809> on<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.290> skin<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:06.280> to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
feel very heavy on the skin you have to

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.010 
feel very heavy on the skin you have to
be<00:01:06.550> careful<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.150> this<00:01:07.510> foundation

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
be careful because this foundation

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.200 
be careful because this foundation
doesn't<00:01:08.229> have<00:01:08.530> any<00:01:08.770> pump<00:01:09.400> at<00:01:09.670> all<00:01:09.940> so<00:01:10.150> you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
doesn't have any pump at all so you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.750 
doesn't have any pump at all so you
might<00:01:10.690> want<00:01:11.050> to<00:01:11.110> be<00:01:11.320> careful<00:01:11.760> transferring

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
might want to be careful transferring

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.430 
might want to be careful transferring
