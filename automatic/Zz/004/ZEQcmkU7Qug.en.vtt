00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.270
 good good today I bring you a second 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.360
 oriental cheesemaking option that was 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.660
 Unfortunately, this one is closed 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.710
 of this website that is called panda 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.449
 as you can see here panda this one serves 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
 very very well at least I have tried it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.429
 quite and everything serves me this subject has 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.259
 here in the left sector has is 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.029
 for iphones applications for iphones 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.240
 of everything they have to choose many 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.899
 options and also for ipads they serve 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.350
 you sign a lot a lot they have a lot of variety 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.780
 and also for those who have symbian 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.780
 and Android is going to serve is pretty 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.269
 here then how do you use this is already 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.199
 easy we just look for with game 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.199
 here a game x 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.060
 how it was in her 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.770
 we looked for it 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.770
 and we look for the version 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.130
 we look for the address that we 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.150
 we want 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.820
 we are in many options 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.410
 then this nothing else would only be 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.430
 that you choose the version that 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.450
 you want depends on your 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.969
 device we click on 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.939
 we hope it charges and we can give it 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.820
 we can see that you bring screenshots that 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.189
 are the preview to see what 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.189
 how this game is pretty good here 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.130
 says that the requirement of weiss 4.3 or 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.170
 up this is very good very good 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.560
 and to download we can download in 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.299
 these 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.799
 sometimes they serve sometimes not but it costs 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.899
 much that in fact they serve me has not 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.659
 served none and to download 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.869
 we're only going here in the download phase 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.520
 and we wait for him to charge and so that 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.799
 download that is the problem of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.289
 of this good at least sometimes the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.899
 The problem with this website is that it lasts 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.880
 the server is very slow at least I do not know 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.360
 if it will happen if you yuto on the internet 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.860
 more or less quickly and I download slowly 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.790
 so to speak, then I do not know what 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.149
 you will come here see me here 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.000
 here he tells me that he unloads 26 to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.900
 twenty six fits is very very very slow 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.490
 but it depends on the literal that you 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.000
 have to verse for me very slow but 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.890
 same serves very well very well 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.080
 that would be all I hope there was 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.080
 liked and see you in the next video
