to begin this braid I'm going to go

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.280 
to begin this braid I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> pick<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.870> piece<00:00:52.080> of<00:00:52.110> hair

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
ahead and pick up a piece of hair

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.830 
ahead and pick up a piece of hair
basically<00:00:53.040> from<00:00:53.190> her<00:00:53.309> ear<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.790> her<00:00:53.879> Park<00:00:54.210> it's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
we're going to divide that in half

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
we're going to divide that in half

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and then you're going to divide those

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
and then you're going to divide those
pieces<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.190> half<00:01:02.430> again<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.780> them

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pieces in half again and you want them

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.770 
pieces in half again and you want them
to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.260> much<00:01:04.500> even<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.750> your

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
to be pretty much even so just do your

to be pretty much even so just do your
best<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.470> them

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
best to get them

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.680 
best to get them
fairly<00:01:08.920> even

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.780

so you just cross them over one over the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.170 
so you just cross them over one over the
other<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:24.100> then<00:01:24.640> you're<00:01:24.790> still<00:01:24.940> going<00:01:25.030> to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.560 
top piece over the two middle pieces and
combine<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.710> the<00:02:00.160> bottom<00:02:00.430> piece<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:01.330> for

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
combine it with the bottom piece so for

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.840 
combine it with the bottom piece so for
right<00:02:01.660> now<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:02.200> strand<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.550> is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
right now it's one strand and that is

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.940 
right now it's one strand and that is
how<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.420> start<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:05.290> little<00:02:05.620> piece<00:02:05.830> right

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
how you start that little piece right

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.300 
how you start that little piece right
there<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.430> how<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.670> start<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.180> braid

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there is how you start the braid

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.070 
there is how you start the braid
now<00:02:09.060> we're<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> pick<00:02:09.600> up<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> piece<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
now we're going to pick up a piece of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.809 
now we're going to pick up a piece of
hair<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> top<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.340> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> where

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
hair from the top this is kind of where

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.790 
hair from the top this is kind of where
the<00:02:11.940> waterfall<00:02:12.209> comes<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.840> we're<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.740> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the waterfall comes in we're going to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.380 
the waterfall comes in we're going to
take<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.130> right<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.490> between<00:02:14.850> our<00:02:14.880> two<00:02:15.180> pieces

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
take it right in between our two pieces

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.100 
take it right in between our two pieces
and<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:17.250> drop<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.760> down<00:02:17.940> chill<00:02:18.600> hang<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
and then drop it down chill hang on to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.199 
and then drop it down chill hang on to
it<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.590> didn't<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.640> didn't<00:02:20.880> bring<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
it so we didn't we didn't bring that

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.610 
it so we didn't we didn't bring that
into<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> braid<00:02:21.750> at<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.170> literally<00:02:22.590> just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
into the braid at all it literally just

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.340 
into the braid at all it literally just
went<00:02:22.950> through<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.370> hair<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.959> still<00:02:25.170> have

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
went through the hair and we still have

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.720 
went through the hair and we still have
our<00:02:25.380> two<00:02:25.620> pieces

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
our two pieces

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.130 
our two pieces
now<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> take<00:02:27.629> your<00:02:27.810> middles

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
now you're going to take your middles

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.580 
now you're going to take your middles
again<00:02:28.410> split<00:02:28.980> them<00:02:29.160> back<00:02:29.310> into<00:02:29.550> two<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.590> take

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
again split them back into two and take

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
again split them back into two and take
this<00:02:31.800> piece<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.640> still<00:02:32.849> have<00:02:32.970> combined

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
this piece but you still have combined

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.920 
this piece but you still have combined
pop<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> middle<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:36.810> you're

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
pop it in the middle and then you're

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.420 
pop it in the middle and then you're
going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.080> take<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.290> top<00:02:37.650> piece<00:02:37.860> again<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
going to take that top piece again and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.759 
going to take that top piece again and
wrap<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.000> over<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.540> combine<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
wrap it over and combine it with that

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.520 
wrap it over and combine it with that
bottom<00:02:41.069> piece<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:42.510> becomes<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:43.200> first

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
bottom piece and that becomes your first

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.100 
bottom piece and that becomes your first
stitch<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.220> I'll<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.300> again<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.959> can

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
stitch so I'll do it again so you can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.259 
stitch so I'll do it again so you can
see<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.370> take<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> piece<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:47.940> hair

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
see it I'm going to take a piece of hair

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.780 
see it I'm going to take a piece of hair
from<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.599> top<00:02:48.980> run<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.099> right<00:02:50.340> down<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
from the top run it right down the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
from the top run it right down the
middle<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.510> two

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
middle of the two

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.200 
middle of the two
and<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:53.170> hurrying<00:02:53.530> onto<00:02:53.830> it

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
and have hurrying onto it

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.420 
and have hurrying onto it
so<00:02:56.210> we<00:02:56.330> still<00:02:56.570> have<00:02:56.780> our<00:02:57.020> two<00:02:57.800> outside<00:02:58.220> edge

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
so we still have our two outside edge

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.970 
so we still have our two outside edge
pieces<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.210> our<00:02:59.480> middles<00:03:00.070> split<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.250> middles

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
pieces and our middles split the middles

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.580 
pieces and our middles split the middles
take<00:03:03.580> your<00:03:03.730> outside<00:03:04.120> pieces<00:03:04.420> put<00:03:05.140> them<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
take your outside pieces put them in the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.059 
take your outside pieces put them in the
center<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.300> wrap<00:03:07.300> those<00:03:07.660> outside<00:03:08.110> edges<00:03:08.349> back

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
center and wrap those outside edges back

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.030 
center and wrap those outside edges back
together<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.930> that's<00:03:10.930> your<00:03:11.200> next<00:03:11.349> stitch<00:03:11.620> and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
together and that's your next stitch and

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.890 
together and that's your next stitch and
you're<00:03:12.819> just<00:03:12.970> going<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.150> continue<00:03:13.330> this

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
you're just going to continue this

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.130 
you're just going to continue this
pattern<00:03:14.170> repeating<00:03:15.090> for<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:16.209> long<00:03:16.480> as<00:03:16.840> you

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
pattern repeating for as long as you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.210 
pattern repeating for as long as you
like

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.800 

now<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.460> me<00:03:24.610> when<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:24.880> get<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.300> about<00:03:25.540> halfway

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
now for me when I get to about halfway

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.960 
now for me when I get to about halfway
back<00:03:26.110> on<00:03:26.350> her<00:03:26.440> head<00:03:26.620> I'm<00:03:27.160> actually<00:03:27.460> just<00:03:27.880> going

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
back on her head I'm actually just going

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.320 
back on her head I'm actually just going
to<00:03:28.060> take<00:03:28.300> this<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.610> kind<00:03:30.610> of<00:03:30.700> use<00:03:31.060> those

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
to take this and just kind of use those

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.440 
to take this and just kind of use those
three<00:03:31.690> pieces<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.440> run<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.370> couple<00:03:34.240> stitches

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
three pieces and run a couple stitches

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.170 
three pieces and run a couple stitches
of<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.930> normal<00:03:35.290> braid<00:03:35.500> only<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.760> hold<00:03:36.970> this

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
of a normal braid only just to hold this

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.890 
of a normal braid only just to hold this
tight<00:03:37.540> while<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.260> work<00:03:38.560> with<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.830> other<00:03:38.980> side

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
tight while I work with the other side

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.360 
tight while I work with the other side
so<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.110> won't<00:03:41.320> really<00:03:41.590> end<00:03:41.740> up<00:03:41.860> using<00:03:42.100> this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
so we won't really end up using this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.800 
so we won't really end up using this
braid<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.660> purely<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.740> hold<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.490> hair

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
braid this is purely just hold the hair

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.720 
braid this is purely just hold the hair
and<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.410> can<00:03:47.590> have<00:03:47.709> her<00:03:47.890> hold<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.489> can<00:03:48.610> use

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
and you can have her hold it you can use

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.550 
and you can have her hold it you can use
an<00:03:48.849> elastic<00:03:49.060> whatever<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.959> need<00:03:50.110> to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.520 

you<00:03:54.890> can<00:03:55.040> go<00:03:55.160> ahead<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.400> let<00:03:55.520> go

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
you can go ahead and let go

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.370 
you can go ahead and let go
and<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:57.160> can<00:03:57.370> see<00:03:57.610> when<00:03:57.910> she<00:03:57.940> lets<00:03:58.300> go<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:59.260> it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
and you can see when she lets go that it

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.920 
and you can see when she lets go that it
drops<00:03:59.650> the<00:04:00.010> waterfall<00:04:00.490> braid<00:04:00.730> effect<00:04:01.420> right

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
drops the waterfall braid effect right

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.900 
drops the waterfall braid effect right
there<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.770> can<00:04:02.920> even<00:04:03.070> pull<00:04:03.370> these<00:04:03.490> part<00:04:03.820> a

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
there you can even pull these part a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.670 
there you can even pull these part a
little<00:04:04.000> bit<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.900> like<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.320> show<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
middle piece a little bit more highlight

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
just going to take the two ends and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.810 
just going to take the two ends and
secure<00:04:26.690> them<00:04:27.050> with<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.230> little<00:04:27.470> like<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> cheap

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
secure them with a little like a cheap

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.540 
secure them with a little like a cheap
black<00:04:29.210> elastic<00:04:29.830> right<00:04:30.830> here

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.730 

just<00:04:33.700> even<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.300> couple<00:04:34.480> times<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:34.960> fine<00:04:35.140> this

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
just even a couple times is fine this

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.470 
just even a couple times is fine this
just<00:04:36.010> allows<00:04:36.130> your<00:04:36.460> hands<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.970> move<00:04:37.120> freely

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
just allows your hands to move freely

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.660 
just allows your hands to move freely
without<00:04:37.810> anything<00:04:38.410> loosening<00:04:38.890> up<00:04:39.070> from<00:04:39.520> this

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
without anything loosening up from this

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.310 
without anything loosening up from this
part<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.150> braid<00:04:40.390> so<00:04:40.810> we<00:04:40.870> don't<00:04:41.020> want<00:04:41.170> that

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
part of the braid so we don't want that

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.640 
part of the braid so we don't want that
coming<00:04:41.980> loose<00:04:42.300> now<00:04:43.300> just<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.930> be<00:04:43.960> fun<00:04:44.290> we're

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
coming loose now just to be fun we're

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800 
coming loose now just to be fun we're
going<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:44.830> put<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.070> into<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.310> combo<00:04:45.820> by<00:04:46.420> turning

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
going to put it into a combo by turning

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.170 
going to put it into a combo by turning
this<00:04:46.930> end<00:04:47.200> into<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.740> fishtail<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:48.880> I'm<00:04:49.000> just

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
this end into a fishtail so I'm just

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.450 
this end into a fishtail so I'm just
going<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.420> split<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.780> two<00:04:49.810> pieces<00:04:50.350> in<00:04:50.500> are<00:04:51.190> the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
going to split the two pieces in are the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.090 
going to split the two pieces in are the
one<00:04:51.640> piece<00:04:51.880> into<00:04:52.180> two<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:53.320> create<00:04:53.590> two<00:04:53.800> and

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
one piece into two to create two and

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:06.750 
one piece into two to create two and
begin<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.030> fishtail

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.370 

so<00:05:07.760> I've<00:05:07.880> completed<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.510> fishtail<00:05:08.900> and<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.200> went

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
so I've completed a fishtail and I went

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.110 
so I've completed a fishtail and I went
back<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.680> pancaked<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.610> just<00:05:10.760> made<00:05:11.000> it

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
back and pancaked it and just made it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.530 
back and pancaked it and just made it
look<00:05:11.150> kind<00:05:11.690> of<00:05:11.750> messy<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.230> fun<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:13.060> soft<00:05:14.060> and

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
look kind of messy and fun and soft and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.960 
look kind of messy and fun and soft and
now<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.140> trick<00:05:15.650> here<00:05:15.920> is<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.580> can<00:05:16.790> take

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
now the trick here is that you can take

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.900 
now the trick here is that you can take
this<00:05:17.120> elastic<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.930> just<00:05:18.680> at<00:05:19.340> least<00:05:19.490> with<00:05:19.730> mine

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
this elastic and just at least with mine

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.730 
this elastic and just at least with mine
you<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.210> use<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> pair<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.660> scissors<00:05:20.720> or<00:05:21.290> you

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
you can use a pair of scissors or you

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.050 
you can use a pair of scissors or you
can<00:05:21.890> just<00:05:22.070> break<00:05:22.310> it

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
can just break it

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.690 
can just break it
and<00:05:24.200> that's<00:05:25.200> going<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.500> relax<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:26.100> whole<00:05:26.400> top

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
and that's going to relax that whole top

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.240 
and that's going to relax that whole top
section<00:05:26.730> too<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:28.290> that<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.530> almost<00:05:28.710> just<00:05:29.040> looks

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
section too so that it almost just looks

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.970 
section too so that it almost just looks
like<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.550> braid<00:05:29.790> goes<00:05:30.060> right<00:05:30.420> into<00:05:30.980> fishtail

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
like the braid goes right into fishtail

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.550 
like the braid goes right into fishtail
which<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.550> kind<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.850> a<00:05:32.940> fun<00:05:33.150> look<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.530> can

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
which is kind of a fun look so you can

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.519 
which is kind of a fun look so you can
just<00:05:34.740> soften<00:05:35.130> that<00:05:35.250> all<00:05:35.460> up

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.679 

just<00:05:38.799> go<00:05:38.919> right<00:05:39.099> in<00:05:39.309> okay<00:05:40.089> guys<00:05:40.269> let's<00:05:40.479> do<00:05:40.569> the

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 
just go right in okay guys let's do the

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.969 
just go right in okay guys let's do the
final<00:05:40.809> spin<00:05:41.099> so<00:05:42.099> we<00:05:42.369> have<00:05:42.839> the<00:05:43.839> braid<00:05:44.169> into<00:05:44.559> the

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
final spin so we have the braid into the

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.399 
final spin so we have the braid into the
fishtail<00:05:45.429> and<00:05:45.759> I<00:05:46.449> want<00:05:46.659> to<00:05:46.749> show<00:05:46.869> you<00:05:46.929> on<00:05:47.259> this

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
fishtail and I want to show you on this

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.009 
fishtail and I want to show you on this
side<00:05:47.709> I<00:05:48.009> have<00:05:48.459> pulled<00:05:48.759> the<00:05:49.029> loops<00:05:49.269> apart<00:05:49.809> a

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:50.019 
side I have pulled the loops apart a

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:51.899 
side I have pulled the loops apart a
little<00:05:50.259> bit<00:05:50.379> so<00:05:51.069> you<00:05:51.159> can<00:05:51.339> see<00:05:51.549> the<00:05:51.699> lines

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
little bit so you can see the lines

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.189 
little bit so you can see the lines
coming<00:05:52.089> through<00:05:52.509> it<00:05:52.599> looks<00:05:52.779> a<00:05:52.899> little<00:05:52.989> bit

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
coming through it looks a little bit

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.109 
coming through it looks a little bit
more<00:05:53.379> like<00:05:53.499> a<00:05:53.529> ladder<00:05:53.769> braid<00:05:54.069> and<00:05:54.459> on<00:05:54.939> this

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:55.119 
more like a ladder braid and on this

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:57.479 
more like a ladder braid and on this
side<00:05:55.389> I<00:05:55.689> haven't<00:05:56.349> spread<00:05:56.649> them<00:05:56.799> out<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:57.189> it

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:57.489 
side I haven't spread them out so it

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:59.969 
side I haven't spread them out so it
looks<00:05:57.519> more<00:05:58.029> like<00:05:58.299> a<00:05:58.329> tight<00:05:58.749> braid<00:05:59.259> so<00:05:59.769> you<00:05:59.829> can

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
looks more like a tight braid so you can

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.649 
looks more like a tight braid so you can
do<00:06:00.069> either<00:06:00.099> one<00:06:00.399> the<00:06:00.939> only<00:06:01.149> difference<00:06:01.479> is

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
do either one the only difference is

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.839 
do either one the only difference is
just<00:06:01.689> pulling<00:06:02.259> those<00:06:02.379> little<00:06:02.649> loops<00:06:02.739> apart<00:06:03.249> so

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
just pulling those little loops apart so
