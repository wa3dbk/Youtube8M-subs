00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay guys so the first thing you want to

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.460 
okay guys so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.190> make<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:05.430> easier<00:00:06.330> for<00:00:06.450> threading<00:00:07.049> is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
do to make it easier for threading is

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.580 
do to make it easier for threading is
label<00:00:08.099> your<00:00:08.280> machine<00:00:09.830> like<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.980> did<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
label your machine like I did here and

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.099 
label your machine like I did here and
you<00:00:13.590> want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.250> number<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.059> by<00:00:15.660> threading

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you want to number it by threading

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.000 
you want to number it by threading
sequence<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> first<00:00:18.570> one

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
sequence so one this is the first one

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.939 
sequence so one this is the first one
second<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.039> third<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.609> fourth<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:24.769> okay<00:00:25.769> so

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
second one third one fourth one okay so

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.460 
second one third one fourth one okay so
the<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the first one we're going to do is the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.959 
the first one we're going to do is the
upper<00:00:28.920> looper<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.660> third<00:00:31.279> one<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
upper looper it is the third one but the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
upper looper it is the third one but the
first<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.170> threading<00:00:34.500> sequence<00:00:43.129> get

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
first one in the threading sequence get

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
first one in the threading sequence get
it<00:00:44.219> into<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.789> groove<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it into that little groove here so it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.650 
it into that little groove here so it
secures<00:00:46.140> its<00:00:46.350> thread<00:00:46.910> open<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> chamber<00:00:49.010> and

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
secures its thread open the chamber and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.819 
secures its thread open the chamber and
you're<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> follow<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.530> green

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you're going to want to follow the green

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.180 
you're going to want to follow the green
line<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:54.230> some<00:00:55.230> Lighting's<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> line<00:00:55.980> will

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
line in some Lighting's the line will

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
line in some Lighting's the line will
look<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> pay

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
look the same so I just got to pay

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.279 
look the same so I just got to pay
special<00:00:57.780> attention<00:00:59.539> green<00:01:00.539> line<00:01:00.719> leads<00:01:00.989> us<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
special attention green line leads us to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.560 
special attention green line leads us to
this<00:01:01.379> hook<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.510> you'll<00:01:03.510> notice

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
this hook right here and you'll notice

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.020 
this hook right here and you'll notice
that<00:01:04.049> there's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> green<00:01:04.619> dot<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.909> you're

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that there's a green dot here so you're

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
that there's a green dot here so you're
going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.479> take<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> thread<00:01:07.049> under

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
going to want to take the thread under

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.510 
going to want to take the thread under
so<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.729> line<00:01:08.930> with<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.280> take<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so it's in line with that take it up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.570 
so it's in line with that take it up
there<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:17.630> I'm<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> thread<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
there and then I'm going to thread it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:29.050 
there and then I'm going to thread it
and<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.450> tweezers

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.480 

and<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.170> are<00:01:30.350> done<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:31.520> upper<00:01:31.760> looper<00:01:36.490> okay

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
and you are done the upper looper okay

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.830 
and you are done the upper looper okay
so<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.759> second<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.119> we're<00:01:38.240> going<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.420> do<00:01:38.600> is

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
so the second what we're going to do is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.010 
so the second what we're going to do is
the<00:01:39.170> lower<00:01:39.380> looper<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.360> fourth<00:01:41.720> one

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the lower looper it is the fourth one

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.590 
the lower looper it is the fourth one
but<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.979> second<00:01:43.670> one<00:01:43.850> in<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.240> threading

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
but the second one in the threading

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.540 
but the second one in the threading
sequence<00:01:45.970> remember<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.119> number<00:01:47.479> them<00:01:48.550> when

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
sequence remember to number them when

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.609 
sequence remember to number them when
you<00:01:49.670> label<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.810> put<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.140> through<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.440> groove

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
you label and put it through the groove

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.320 
you label and put it through the groove
here<00:01:54.970> open<00:01:55.970> your<00:01:56.000> chamber<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.130> lead<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.280> down

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
here open your chamber and lead it down

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.440 
here open your chamber and lead it down
following<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.540> blue<00:01:59.750> line<00:02:01.240> you're<00:02:02.240> going<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
following the blue line you're going to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.639 
following the blue line you're going to
notice<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:04.149> these<00:02:05.149> two<00:02:05.690> little<00:02:05.990> hooks<00:02:06.259> here

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
notice that these two little hooks here

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.249 
notice that these two little hooks here
have<00:02:07.490> two<00:02:07.789> blue<00:02:07.940> dots<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.720> want<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.959> take

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
have two blue dots so you want to take

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.310 
have two blue dots so you want to take
the<00:02:09.470> thread<00:02:09.800> below<00:02:10.039> both<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.670> them<00:02:11.080> bring<00:02:12.080> them

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the thread below both of them bring them

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.720 
the thread below both of them bring them
up<00:02:12.470> into<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.860> hook<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:16.280> might<00:02:16.489> want<00:02:16.670> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
up into this hook and you might want to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.270 
up into this hook and you might want to
use<00:02:16.880> your<00:02:17.090> hand<00:02:17.300> dial<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:18.080> bring<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.069> out<00:02:19.250> a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
use your hand dial to bring this out a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.240 
use your hand dial to bring this out a
little<00:02:20.500> where<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> blue<00:02:21.860> arrows<00:02:22.459> are<00:02:24.250> you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
little where the blue arrows are you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.660 
little where the blue arrows are you
want<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.550> bring<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.730> out<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:28.610> is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
want to bring that out and this is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.430 
want to bring that out and this is
tricky<00:02:29.030> part<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> you're<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> want<00:02:31.459> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
tricky part so you're going to want to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.530 
tricky part so you're going to want to
get<00:02:33.440> your<00:02:33.650> thread<00:02:35.110> behind<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.940> groove<00:02:38.269> right

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
get your thread behind that groove right

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.800 
get your thread behind that groove right
there<00:02:38.600> see<00:02:39.560> how<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.010> groove<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
there see how it's in the groove and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.509 
there see how it's in the groove and
then<00:02:42.610> we're<00:02:43.610> going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.470> snap<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.340> it's

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
then we're going to snap it in so it's

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.030 
then we're going to snap it in so it's
secure<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.530> you'll<00:02:48.530> know<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.860> secure

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
secure and you'll know it's secure

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.750 
secure and you'll know it's secure
because<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.700> two<00:02:49.880> arrows<00:02:50.299> they<00:02:50.660> line<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
because the two arrows they line up and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.500 
because the two arrows they line up and
then<00:02:56.329> we're<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> thread<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.829> thread

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.080 

through
