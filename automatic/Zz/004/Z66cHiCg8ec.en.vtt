one<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.179> things<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.509> had<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.690> do<00:01:29.990> because

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
one of the things I had to do because

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.589 
one of the things I had to do because
this<00:01:31.100> was<00:01:31.310> popping<00:01:31.729> open<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.149> I<00:01:32.209> ended<00:01:32.360> up<00:01:32.479> just

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
this was popping open so I ended up just

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.540 
this was popping open so I ended up just
gluing<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.110> together<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.770> keep<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.069> to<00:01:34.190> keep

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
gluing this together to keep it to keep

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.639 
gluing this together to keep it to keep
it<00:01:34.670> secure<00:01:34.789> but<00:01:35.660> because<00:01:35.899> your<00:01:36.020> fire<00:01:36.229> steel<00:01:36.500> is

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
it secure but because your fire steel is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.139 
it secure but because your fire steel is
here<00:01:36.860> which<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.250> fire<00:01:37.429> steel<00:01:37.670> doesn't<00:01:37.849> come

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
here which the fire steel doesn't come

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.620 
here which the fire steel doesn't come
straight<00:01:38.479> out<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:39.200> actually<00:01:39.619> twist<00:01:40.160> it<00:01:40.369> and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
straight out you actually twist it and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.760 
straight out you actually twist it and
then<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.780> comes<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.410> way<00:01:42.470> you're<00:01:42.740> not

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
then it comes out that way you're not

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.609 
then it comes out that way you're not
going<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.069> lose<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.550> in<00:01:44.179> a<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.020> survival<00:01:45.349> type

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
going to lose it in a in a survival type

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.150 
going to lose it in a in a survival type
situation<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.360> keeps<00:01:47.599> in<00:01:47.810> place<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.410> then

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
situation but it keeps in place and then
