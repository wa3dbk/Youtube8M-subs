don't have the energy level of the
strength<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.160> really<00:00:58.399> deal<00:00:58.670> with<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:58.969> kind

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269

more level and a little easier to get to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.760 
more level and a little easier to get to
and<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:08.240> little<00:01:08.420> less<00:01:08.660> chance<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.790> getting<00:01:10.790> hurt

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
decided to do

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
decided to do
isn't<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.760> did<00:02:17.000> do<00:02:17.209> was<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.629> ordered<00:02:18.019> that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
isn't what I did do was I ordered that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.949 
isn't what I did do was I ordered that

under quilt I'll weighs 21 ounces and
that<00:02:31.760> will<00:02:31.970> cure<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.209> problem<00:02:33.489> now<00:02:35.049> when<00:02:36.049> I

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
that will cure that problem now when I

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.460 
that will cure that problem now when I
go<00:02:36.200> backpacking<00:02:37.040> again<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:38.060> probably<00:02:39.019> will

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
go backpacking again I probably will

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.429 
go backpacking again I probably will
take<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.129> Blackbird<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.879> me<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.329> because

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
take the Blackbird with me just because

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.039 
take the Blackbird with me just because
it's<00:02:42.439> just<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.890> done<00:02:43.250> comfortable<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.180> that

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
it's just so done comfortable and that

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.110 
it's just so done comfortable and that
will<00:02:45.290> pose<00:02:45.560> some<00:02:45.890> problems<00:02:45.920> as<00:02:46.519> it's<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.849> fairly

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
will pose some problems as it's a fairly

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.509 
will pose some problems as it's a fairly
heavy<00:02:47.480> hammock<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.200> then<00:02:48.859> if<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.129> take<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
heavy hammock and then if I take the

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.220 
heavy hammock and then if I take the
under<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.090> full-length<00:02:50.540> Mount<00:02:50.989> Washington

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230

under the full-length Mount Washington
under<00:02:51.920> quilt<00:02:52.190> long<00:02:52.430> with<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.810> heavy

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
under quilt long with it that is heavy

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.170 
under quilt long with it that is heavy
too<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:55.159> I<00:02:55.220> think<00:02:55.310> that's<00:02:55.549> going<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:55.909> push<00:02:56.150> my

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
too and I think that's going to push my

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.839 
too and I think that's going to push my
base<00:02:56.599> log<00:02:56.900> wait<00:02:57.200> up<00:02:57.409> to<00:02:57.650> maybe<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.280> little<00:02:58.519> over

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
base log wait up to maybe a little over

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.210 
base log wait up to maybe a little over
eight<00:02:59.060> pounds<00:02:59.200> depending<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:00.859> kind<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.129> a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
eight pounds depending on what kind of a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.920 
eight pounds depending on what kind of a
song<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.639> dance<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:02.060> do<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.480> rest<00:03:02.659> of<00:03:02.780> my

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
song and dance I do with the rest of my

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.559 
song and dance I do with the rest of my
gear<00:03:03.200> I've<00:03:04.189> got<00:03:04.489> my<00:03:05.290> Cuban<00:03:06.290> fiber<00:03:06.560> tarp<00:03:07.569> which

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
gear I've got my Cuban fiber tarp which

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.830 
gear I've got my Cuban fiber tarp which
saved<00:03:08.930> me<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.079> lot<00:03:09.139> of<00:03:09.349> weight<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:10.849> anyway<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
saved me a lot of weight so anyway the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.369 
saved me a lot of weight so anyway the
question<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.409> would<00:03:12.650> all<00:03:12.859> that<00:03:13.129> fit<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:14.379> this

weight<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:58.090> 10<00:03:59.090> pounds<00:03:59.599> and<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:01.459> don't<00:04:02.150> know

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
weight of 10 pounds and I don't know

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.089 
weight of 10 pounds and I don't know
until<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.900> put<00:04:03.169> it<00:04:03.290> all<00:04:03.409> in<00:04:03.560> there<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.829> try<00:04:03.949> it

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
until I put it all in there and try it

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.490 
until I put it all in there and try it
but<00:04:04.760> my<00:04:04.909> gut<00:04:05.120> feeling<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.629> probably<00:04:06.169> not<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
but my gut feeling is probably not the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.430 
but my gut feeling is probably not the
straps<00:04:07.040> pretty<00:04:07.849> narrow<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.810> think<00:04:09.319> it'd

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
straps pretty narrow and I I think it'd

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.039 
straps pretty narrow and I I think it'd
probably<00:04:09.799> be<00:04:10.150> uncomfortable<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.359> if<00:04:11.449> it<00:04:11.569> is<00:04:11.750> i

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
probably be uncomfortable and if it is i

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.069 
probably be uncomfortable and if it is i
will<00:04:12.769> just<00:04:12.919> go<00:04:13.069> to<00:04:13.190> my<00:04:13.459> blue<00:04:14.060> backpack<00:04:14.359> which

will just go to my blue backpack which
