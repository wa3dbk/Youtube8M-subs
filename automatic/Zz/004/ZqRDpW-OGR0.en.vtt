00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
editions for like cod ghosts or black

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.650 
editions for like cod ghosts or black
ops<00:00:56.559> 2<00:00:56.829> because<00:00:57.190> basically<00:00:57.969> it<00:00:58.239> doesn't<00:00:58.539> come

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
ops 2 because basically it doesn't come

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.750 
ops 2 because basically it doesn't come
with<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.840> season<00:00:59.170> pass<00:00:59.199> and<00:00:59.800> for<00:01:00.039> some<00:01:00.250> dumbass

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
with a season pass and for some dumbass

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.090 
with a season pass and for some dumbass
reason<00:01:01.210> it's<00:01:01.359> only<00:01:01.660> exclusive<00:01:02.260> at<00:01:02.530> gamestop

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
reason it's only exclusive at gamestop

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.609 
reason it's only exclusive at gamestop
so<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.699> don't<00:01:04.300> know<00:01:04.360> why<00:01:04.539> cops<00:01:04.930> ripping<00:01:05.320> us<00:01:05.440> off

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
nitty-gritty stuff at the end so the

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.059 
nitty-gritty stuff at the end so the
next<00:01:13.390> collector's<00:01:13.899> edition<00:01:14.319> is<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.860> digital

next collector's edition is the digital
deluxe<00:01:15.640> edition<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:16.300> listen<00:01:16.539> to<00:01:16.599> what<00:01:16.720> I'm

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
deluxe edition and listen to what I'm

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.180 
deluxe edition and listen to what I'm
getting<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.259> I<00:01:17.349> think<00:01:17.590> this<00:01:17.679> one<00:01:17.860> makes<00:01:18.009> the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
getting and I think this one makes the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.520 
getting and I think this one makes the
most<00:01:18.340> sense<00:01:18.490> because<00:01:19.030> first<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.539> all<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:20.319> comes

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
most sense because first of all it comes

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.850 
most sense because first of all it comes
with<00:01:20.709> the<00:01:20.740> season<00:01:21.220> pass<00:01:21.459> and<00:01:22.530> I'll<00:01:23.530> go<00:01:23.679> through

with the season pass and I'll go through

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.169 
with the season pass and I'll go through
all<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.009> other<00:01:24.160> stuff<00:01:24.220> later<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:24.819> this<00:01:24.849> one

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
all the other stuff later but this one

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.180 
all the other stuff later but this one
is<00:01:25.360> actually<00:01:25.690> priced<00:01:26.140> at<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.410> hundred<00:01:26.709> dollars

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
is actually priced at a hundred dollars

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.730

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.800 
and you can only get it digitally so you
can't<00:01:30.130> get<00:01:30.280> like<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.459> physical<00:01:30.970> copy<00:01:31.149> but<00:01:31.599> I

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
can't get like a physical copy but I

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.570

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
doesn't even make any sense we're just

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.009 
doesn't even make any sense we're just
sort<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.970> stupid<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.510> basically<00:03:34.660> got

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
sort of stupid so you basically got

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.509 
sort of stupid so you basically got

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.220 
to season pass so or you can probably
buy<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.459> separately<00:03:39.880> but<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:41.079> basically

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
buy it separately but that basically

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.170 
buy it separately but that basically
concludes<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.190> hardened<00:03:42.519> edition<00:03:42.579> now<00:03:43.030> we're

going to head over to the digital deluxe

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.190 
going to head over to the digital deluxe
edition<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.730> one<00:03:45.880> I'm<00:03:46.030> getting<00:03:46.359> so<00:03:46.780> basically

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
edition the one I'm getting so basically

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.599 
edition the one I'm getting so basically
to<00:03:47.290> me<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:47.650> one<00:03:47.799> makes<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.190> most<00:03:48.430> sense

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
to me this one makes the most sense

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.430 
to me this one makes the most sense
because<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.450> actually<00:03:49.570> comes<00:03:49.900> with<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.140> season

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
because it actually comes with a season

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.250 
because it actually comes with a season
pass<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.820> can<00:03:52.000> download<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.450> digitally

pass and you can download it digitally

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.400 
pass and you can download it digitally
so<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.739> can<00:03:54.070> basically<00:03:54.790> play<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.630> game<00:03:55.810> at

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
so you can basically play the game at

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.110 
so you can basically play the game at
the<00:03:56.440> exact<00:03:57.010> time<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.430> comes<00:03:57.609> out<00:03:57.730> because<00:03:58.000> you

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
the exact time it comes out because you

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.780

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
steelbook so I sort of dumb but

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.740 
steelbook so I sort of dumb but
obviously<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.160> can't<00:04:41.430> magically

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
obviously you can't magically

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.310 
obviously you can't magically
materialize<00:04:42.830> physical<00:04:43.830> items<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:45.120> again<00:04:46.080> I

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
materialize physical items so again I

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.080 
materialize physical items so again I
think<00:04:46.500> may<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:47.190> think<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.760> one<00:04:47.850> that<00:04:48.000> makes

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
think may I think the one that makes

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.270 
think may I think the one that makes
most<00:04:48.330> sense<00:04:48.479> is<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.080> digital<00:04:49.229> deluxe<00:04:49.740> edition
