00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hey guys real quick I wanted to show you

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.749 
hey guys real quick I wanted to show you
how<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.030> cooled<00:00:03.419> off<00:00:03.570> my<00:00:03.780> tank<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.290> full<00:00:04.830> 10

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
how I cooled off my tank a full 10

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.320 
how I cooled off my tank a full 10
degrees<00:00:07.189> with<00:00:08.189> less<00:00:08.429> than<00:00:09.139> $20<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.410> materials

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
degrees with less than $20 and materials

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.470 
degrees with less than $20 and materials
so<00:00:12.440> let's<00:00:13.440> get<00:00:13.590> started

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
so let's get started

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.990 
so let's get started
basically<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.049> way<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.890> tank<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.369> cooled<00:00:17.699> is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
basically the way the tank is cooled is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.359 
basically the way the tank is cooled is
by<00:00:18.390> evaporation<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.650> there's<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> couple<00:00:20.189> ways

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
by evaporation but there's a couple ways

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.150 
by evaporation but there's a couple ways
that<00:00:20.760> help<00:00:20.910> aid<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.600> keeping<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.769> tank<00:00:23.010> cool

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that help aid in keeping the tank cool

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.759 
that help aid in keeping the tank cool
and<00:00:23.460> I'll<00:00:23.550> go<00:00:23.910> over<00:00:24.060> those<00:00:24.300> also<00:00:25.230> everything

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and I'll go over those also everything

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
and I'll go over those also everything
that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.039> bought<00:00:26.310> I'll<00:00:26.519> put<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> link<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
that I bought I'll put a link to in the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
that I bought I'll put a link to in the
description<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.800> guys<00:00:28.890> want<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> go

description so if you guys want to go
pick<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:30.539> affordable<00:00:31.260> especially

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
pick them up very affordable especially

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
pick them up very affordable especially
when<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> compare<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> chillers<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.200> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
when you compare it to chillers I was I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
when you compare it to chillers I was I
considered<00:00:34.890> all<00:00:34.950> kinds<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.309> options<00:00:35.460> query<00:00:36.210> me

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
considered all kinds of options query me

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
considered all kinds of options query me
chillers<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.260> expensive<00:00:37.770> they<00:00:37.920> use<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
chillers are very expensive they use a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.200 
chillers are very expensive they use a
lot<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> electricity<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.829> they're<00:00:40.829> bulky

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
lot of electricity and they're bulky

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.020 
lot of electricity and they're bulky
they're<00:00:42.210> hard<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> hide<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.829> need<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> come

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
they're hard to hide so I need to come

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
they're hard to hide so I need to come
up<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.300> something<00:00:45.930> else<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.350> worked<00:00:46.500> for

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
up with something else that worked for

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.000 
up with something else that worked for
me<00:00:46.770> did<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> lot<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> experimenting<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.230> was

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
me did a lot of experimenting and I was

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
me did a lot of experimenting and I was
very<00:00:50.190> excited<00:00:50.399> when<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> achieved<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> results

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
very excited when I achieved the results

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
very excited when I achieved the results
I<00:00:52.170> did<00:00:52.350> full<00:00:53.190> 10<00:00:53.430> degrees<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:54.030> house<00:00:54.270> during

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I did full 10 degrees my house during

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
I did full 10 degrees my house during
the<00:00:55.199> day<00:00:55.320> gets<00:00:55.800> around<00:00:56.129> 85<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.020> want

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the day gets around 85 and I don't want

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
the day gets around 85 and I don't want
to<00:00:58.289> run<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> AC<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:59.010> day<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> keep<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> tank

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to run the AC all day to keep the tank

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.860 
to run the AC all day to keep the tank
cool<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.309> works<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.000> well<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.539> me

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
cool so this works very very well for me

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.280 
cool so this works very very well for me
I<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.500> leave<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.280> a/c<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:06.360> 85<00:01:06.869> during<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> day

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I can leave the a/c at 85 during the day

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.399 
I can leave the a/c at 85 during the day
and<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.189> tank<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.729> stay<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> 75<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:10.380> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and the tank will stay is 75 which is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
and the tank will stay is 75 which is
perfect<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.760> crystal<00:01:12.450> red

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
perfect because I have crystal red

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.490 
perfect because I have crystal red
shrimp<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.650> very<00:01:13.830> sensitive<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:15.500> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
shrimp which are very sensitive to the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
shrimp which are very sensitive to the
heat<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.850> cold<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:19.790> hope<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.939> guys

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
wondering this is just an LED light

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
wondering this is just an LED light
weight<00:01:29.490> stays<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.090> cool<00:01:30.710> puts<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> lot<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
weight stays very cool puts off a lot of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.469 
weight stays very cool puts off a lot of
light<00:01:32.220> good<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.150> plants<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.710> like<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.890> small

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
light good for plants I like it small

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
light good for plants I like it small
doesn't<00:01:36.479> use<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> electricity<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
doesn't use a lot of electricity and it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.899 
doesn't use a lot of electricity and it
has<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.420> crisp<00:01:39.990> white<00:01:40.640> light<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
has that very crisp white light that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
has that very crisp white light that
shimmers<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.939> probably<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
shimmers this right here is probably the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.219 
shimmers this right here is probably the
most<00:01:46.290> important<00:01:46.770> thing<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> USB<00:01:48.780> fan

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
most important thing this is a USB fan

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.800 
most important thing this is a USB fan
it's<00:01:49.799> extremely<00:01:50.460> quiet<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> hear<00:01:53.810> or

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it's extremely quiet so you can hear or

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's extremely quiet so you can hear or
not<00:01:55.079> hear<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.950> very<00:01:56.219> quiet<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.659> just

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
not hear it's very quiet it is just

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.130 
not hear it's very quiet it is just
plugged<00:01:58.170> into<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.619> USB<00:01:59.180> extender<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.020> get

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
plugged into a USB extender you can get

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
plugged into a USB extender you can get
these<00:02:01.259> anywhere<00:02:01.380> I'll<00:02:01.920> show<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.159> where<00:02:02.549> to

it's<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.930> doubles<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.950> some

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's just doubles I put some

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.910 
it's just doubles I put some
double-sided<00:02:08.429> tape<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.840> stuck<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.470> the

double-sided tape and it's stuck to the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.340 
double-sided tape and it's stuck to the
frame<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.599> tank<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:12.989> here

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
frame of the tank right here

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.080 
frame of the tank right here
it's<00:02:14.650> very<00:02:14.950> very<00:02:15.220> strong<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.790> been<00:02:15.940> there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
it's very very strong it's been there

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.710 
it's very very strong it's been there
for<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.240> long<00:02:16.360> time<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.900> not<00:02:17.050> going<00:02:17.290> anywhere

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
for a long time it's not going anywhere

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.550 
for a long time it's not going anywhere
just<00:02:19.720> make<00:02:19.900> sure<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.140> get<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> good

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
just make sure you get the good

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.340 
just make sure you get the good
double-sided<00:02:21.190> tape<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:23.020> great<00:02:23.200> thing

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
double-sided tape and the great thing

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.590 
double-sided tape and the great thing
about<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.740> not<00:02:24.340> only<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.700> quiet<00:02:24.940> puts<00:02:25.510> a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
about this not only is it quiet puts a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.100 
about this not only is it quiet puts a
lot<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.920> awful<00:02:26.920> lot<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.070> air<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.910> also<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.960> can

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
lot of awful lot of air it also you can

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.770 
lot of awful lot of air it also you can
adjust<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.590> though<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.430> metal<00:02:30.760> arm<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.570> can

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
adjust it though the metal arm you can

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.330 
adjust it though the metal arm you can
swivel<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.890> need<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.070> lot<00:02:33.310> of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
swivel it so if you need a lot of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.890 
swivel it so if you need a lot of
cooling<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.000> can<00:02:34.030> point<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> fan<00:02:34.690> down

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
cooling you can point the fan down

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.710 
cooling you can point the fan down
directly<00:02:35.470> at<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.710> water<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> will

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
directly at the water and it will

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.660 
directly at the water and it will
evaporate<00:02:37.930> faster<00:02:38.350> if<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:39.310> need<00:02:39.460> less

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
evaporate faster if you need less

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.760 
evaporate faster if you need less
cooling<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:41.080> know<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.410> couple<00:02:41.650> degrees

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
cooling you know just a couple degrees

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.520 
cooling you know just a couple degrees
you<00:02:42.340> can<00:02:42.780> point<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.960> little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.200> more<00:02:44.350> up

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
you can point it a little bit more up

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.920 
you can point it a little bit more up
right<00:02:44.830> now<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.250> mines<00:02:45.550> out<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:46.090> little<00:02:46.510> bit<00:02:46.690> of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
right now it mines out a little bit of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.860 
right now it mines out a little bit of
an<00:02:47.080> up<00:02:47.260> angle<00:02:47.710> my<00:02:48.580> tanks<00:02:48.880> been<00:02:49.030> staying<00:02:49.300> really

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
an up angle my tanks been staying really

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.300 
an up angle my tanks been staying really
cool<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.410> that's<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.430> good

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
cool so that's really good

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
cool so that's really good
also<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.640> helps<00:02:55.150> pull<00:02:55.480> off<00:02:55.600> keeps<00:02:56.020> my<00:02:56.200> LEDs

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
also it helps pull off keeps my LEDs

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.510 
also it helps pull off keeps my LEDs
nice<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.010> cool<00:02:57.450> which<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.630> important<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.560> keep

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
nice and cool which is important to keep

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.240 
nice and cool which is important to keep
them<00:03:00.820> lasting<00:03:01.660> long<00:03:01.860> if<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.980> guys<00:03:03.130> are

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
them lasting long if you guys are

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.530 
them lasting long if you guys are
wondering<00:03:03.430> what<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.730> big<00:03:03.880> white<00:03:04.150> thing<00:03:04.180> is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
wondering what that big white thing is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.440 
wondering what that big white thing is
that<00:03:05.380> filter<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> keep<00:03:07.270> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
that filter that is just to keep the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.710 
that filter that is just to keep the
baby<00:03:07.630> shrimp<00:03:07.990> from<00:03:08.350> getting<00:03:09.390> sucked<00:03:10.390> up<00:03:10.570> into

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
baby shrimp from getting sucked up into

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.520 
baby shrimp from getting sucked up into
the<00:03:10.900> filter<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:13.630> one<00:03:13.810> has<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.380> is

of<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.930> tank<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:51.520> tank<00:03:51.730> could<00:03:52.060> wrap<00:03:52.600> if<00:03:53.080> you

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
of the tank the tank could wrap if you

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.850 
of the tank the tank could wrap if you
will<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:54.190> know<00:03:54.750> what<00:03:55.750> you'd<00:03:55.900> call<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.170> but<00:03:56.410> you

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
will you know what you'd call it but you

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.410 
will you know what you'd call it but you
know<00:03:56.950> as<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> back<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.700> little<00:03:58.000> bit<00:03:58.090> smaller

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
know as the back is a little bit smaller

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.140 
know as the back is a little bit smaller
because<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.260> hang<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.709> back<00:03:59.920> filters<00:04:00.430> you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
because of the hang on back filters you

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.690 
because of the hang on back filters you
know<00:04:01.240> so<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.510> could<00:04:01.630> fit<00:04:01.840> nice<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.110> snug

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
know so it could fit nice and snug

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.300 
know so it could fit nice and snug
against<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.760> back<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.150> tank<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.590> then

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
against the back of the tank and then

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.990 
against the back of the tank and then
also<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.209> sunshade<00:04:07.870> had<00:04:08.560> this<00:04:08.860> velcro<00:04:09.370> that

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
also the sunshade had this velcro that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.400 
also the sunshade had this velcro that
was<00:04:10.150> already<00:04:10.360> attached<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.050> which<00:04:11.200> was<00:04:11.350> a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
was already attached to it which was a

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.650 
was already attached to it which was a
bonus<00:04:11.890> because<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:13.120> know<00:04:13.209> when<00:04:13.330> you<00:04:13.420> attach

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
bonus because you know when you attach

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.020 
bonus because you know when you attach
it<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.020> back<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.290> tank<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:15.520> just<00:04:15.730> velcro

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
it to the back of tank you just velcro

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.170 
it to the back of tank you just velcro
it<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.270> and<00:04:17.970> keeps<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.120> quick<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.630> easy<00:04:21.180> for

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
it on and keeps it quick and easy for

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.800 
it on and keeps it quick and easy for
you<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:22.510> when<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.140> put<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.590> shield<00:04:24.430> on<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:25.030> don't

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
you so when I put the shield on I don't

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.190 
you so when I put the shield on I don't
leave<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.260> light<00:04:26.410> on<00:04:26.440> during<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.919> day

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
leave the light on during the day

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.440 
leave the light on during the day
just<00:04:28.070> because<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.520> know<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.730> reduce<00:04:28.850> heat<00:04:29.420> I

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
just because you know to reduce heat I

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.700 
just because you know to reduce heat I
actually<00:04:29.660> just<00:04:29.900> turn<00:04:30.140> on<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.260> light<00:04:30.500> when<00:04:30.650> I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
actually just turn on the light when I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.090 
actually just turn on the light when I
get<00:04:30.890> home<00:04:31.130> from<00:04:31.430> work<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:33.230> way<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.530> ACS<00:04:33.950> on

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
get home from work that way the ACS on

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.610 
get home from work that way the ACS on
scheme<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.580> can<00:04:34.670> attain<00:04:34.940> cool<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:36.530> know

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
scheme you can attain cool and you know

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.890 
scheme you can attain cool and you know
I<00:04:36.650> don't<00:04:36.740> have<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:38.150> cover<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.660> tank

I don't have the the cover on the tank

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.770 
I don't have the the cover on the tank
so<00:04:39.730> if<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.910> if<00:04:41.030> you're<00:04:41.180> wondering<00:04:41.480> if<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:41.600> leave

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
okay so I'll show you how quick it is to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:05:02.360 
okay so I'll show you how quick it is to
put<00:04:47.510> on<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.950> tank<00:04:49.600> cover<00:04:52.450> just<00:04:53.450> slip<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:53.720> on

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.700 

like<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:05.550> Philco<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.640> on<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:07.650> you're<00:05:08.650> all

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
like that Philco it on and you're all

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.310 
like that Philco it on and you're all
set

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
set

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.490 
set
it<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.860> easy<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.600> your<00:05:13.600> tank<00:05:13.930> will<00:05:14.200> stay

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
it is that easy and your tank will stay

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.660 
it is that easy and your tank will stay
very<00:05:14.880> cool<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:17.010> there's<00:05:18.010> a<00:05:18.070> little<00:05:18.310> bit<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.610> a

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
very cool so there's a little bit of a

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.440 
very cool so there's a little bit of a
gap<00:05:18.820> in<00:05:19.030> mine

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
gap in mine

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.330 
gap in mine
you<00:05:20.020> know<00:05:20.110> I'm<00:05:20.200> going<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.380> redo<00:05:20.650> this<00:05:20.800> make<00:05:21.310> a

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
you know I'm going to redo this make a

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.010 
you know I'm going to redo this make a
little<00:05:21.550> better<00:05:21.820> but<00:05:22.090> still<00:05:22.210> even<00:05:22.480> with<00:05:22.780> this

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
little better but still even with this

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.630 
little better but still even with this
gap<00:05:23.340> I'm<00:05:24.340> still<00:05:24.580> getting<00:05:24.850> about<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.210> 10<00:05:25.450> degrees

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
gap I'm still getting about a 10 degrees

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.340 
gap I'm still getting about a 10 degrees
cooling<00:05:27.640> effect<00:05:27.880> now<00:05:28.300> another<00:05:28.870> thing<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.170> need

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
cooling effect now another thing I need

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.890 
cooling effect now another thing I need
to<00:05:29.440> mention<00:05:29.590> that's<00:05:30.190> pretty<00:05:30.880> important<00:05:31.300> if

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
to mention that's pretty important if

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.650 
to mention that's pretty important if
you<00:05:32.050> guys<00:05:32.200> are<00:05:32.410> not<00:05:32.590> achieving<00:05:33.160> this<00:05:33.510> or<00:05:34.510> if

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
you guys are not achieving this or if

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.410 
you guys are not achieving this or if
you<00:05:34.780> live<00:05:34.930> in<00:05:35.080> high<00:05:35.260> humidity<00:05:36.180> climates<00:05:37.180> one

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
you live in high humidity climates one

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.500 
you live in high humidity climates one
thing<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:38.080> reason<00:05:38.380> why<00:05:38.940> I'm<00:05:39.940> getting<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.330> lot

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
thing the reason why I'm getting a lot

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.090 
thing the reason why I'm getting a lot
of<00:05:40.540> cooling<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.050> lot<00:05:41.230> of<00:05:41.320> evaporation<00:05:41.560> is

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
of cooling a lot of evaporation is

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.860 
of cooling a lot of evaporation is
because<00:05:42.790> I<00:05:42.910> do<00:05:42.970> live<00:05:43.210> in<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.420> desert<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
because I do live in the desert the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.530 
because I do live in the desert the
humidity<00:05:44.380> here<00:05:44.650> is<00:05:44.800> very<00:05:45.040> very<00:05:45.270> very<00:05:46.270> low

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
humidity here is very very very low

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.020 
humidity here is very very very low
especially<00:05:46.960> in<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.110> summer<00:05:47.580> therefore<00:05:48.580> water

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
especially in the summer therefore water

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.930 
especially in the summer therefore water
evaporates<00:05:50.130> extremely<00:05:51.130> efficiently<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:53.940> if

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
evaporates extremely efficiently so if

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.010 
evaporates extremely efficiently so if
you<00:05:55.090> live<00:05:55.300> in<00:05:55.330> less<00:05:55.600> state<00:05:55.810> like<00:05:55.990> Florida

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
you live in less state like Florida

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.800 
you live in less state like Florida
where<00:05:56.650> it's<00:05:56.770> very<00:05:56.830> humid<00:05:57.100> I'm<00:05:58.060> not<00:05:58.420> sure<00:05:58.660> I've

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
where it's very humid I'm not sure I've

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.970 
where it's very humid I'm not sure I've
not<00:05:58.990> tested<00:05:59.140> this<00:05:59.470> in<00:05:59.620> high<00:05:59.740> humidity

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
not tested this in high humidity

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.090 
not tested this in high humidity
environments<00:06:00.910> however<00:06:01.900> I<00:06:01.960> assume<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:02.770> you
