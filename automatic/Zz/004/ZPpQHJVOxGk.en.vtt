cheating way of playing this song if you
really<00:02:45.580> can't<00:02:45.790> get<00:02:45.909> the<00:02:45.970> coordination<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.659> to

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
really can't get the coordination is to

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.600 
really can't get the coordination is to
play<00:02:47.140> all<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.500> hi-hat<00:02:47.860> notes<00:02:48.069> with<00:02:48.220> your<00:02:48.310> foot

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
play all the hi-hat notes with your foot

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.430 
play all the hi-hat notes with your foot
instead<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.629> throughout<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.019> song<00:02:50.230> I'm

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
instead so throughout the song I'm

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.470 
instead so throughout the song I'm
playing<00:02:50.470> one<00:02:51.340> two<00:02:51.640> three<00:02:52.360> four<00:02:52.870> my<00:02:53.440> white<00:02:54.159> hat

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
playing one two three four my white hat

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.670 
playing one two three four my white hat
though<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.629> playing<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.989> one-and<00:02:56.409> two-and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680

though is playing the one-and two-and
three-and<00:02:57.220> four-and<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.110> hi-hat<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.250> it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
three-and four-and on the hi-hat so it

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.130 
three-and four-and on the hi-hat so it
means<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.120> don't<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.450> worry<00:03:01.720> about<00:03:01.810> left

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140
