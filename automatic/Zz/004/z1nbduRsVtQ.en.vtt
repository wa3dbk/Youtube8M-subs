00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:08.109
 and we're going to replace the stack of a 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:11.559
 alcatel one touch first team abu ok 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.280
 let's use a screwdriver size 6 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.190
 you can buy it in this google this and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.199
 one flat tip screwdriver this will 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.880
 remove some screws there are screws 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.940
 big and small but do not worry 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.070
 the same unarmed takes them both 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.050
 and we are going to remove everything and here you have the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:35.110
 friends to not have time and we're going to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.020
 detach the back cover this 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.460
 this part is stuck with the layer 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.390
 then do not worry it's going to come 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.480
 all together and this we will raise in the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.050
 screen and the color is in the middle of the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.780
 screen and in this color this silver 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.900
 then you can use putting this 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.050
 flat tip screwdriver or this use your 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.879
 fingers this as you like now something very 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.430
 important let's start first 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.190
 this part down where is the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.860
 charger the charger port and what 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.540
 we raise first because here up there is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.540
 a thin little cable that you can 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.870
 this break if you do not know how to talk to 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.510
 watch out 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.040
 then let's start detaching 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.040
 what part d 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.830
 you can hear how it is coming off 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.830
 little by little we go 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 around 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.820
 now yes we already take off the part of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.190
 down all very carefully what 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.200
 we raise and when we are here we go 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.240
 how to push up the layer 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 how slowly 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.610
 slowly we push it up 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.200
 is still we remove the main lid 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.119
 and here the speaker is stuck then 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.189
 if we can not listen to music in this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.050
 kitchen you have to replace it here 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.290
 is the battery the battery is coming 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.570
 is not stuck is the advantage I hope that 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.970
 be on all the phones in the list 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.130
 alcatel some we have that comes with 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 glue so more complicated what 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.890
 let's do is lift the battery to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.069
 see if you can see it well in the camera 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.799
 although this one 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.459
 then once we get up we use the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:34.579
 flat point point screwdriver and let's 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.579
 put it very carefully 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.480
 it can show better like this 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.909
 that is raised then with that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.359
 screwdriver I'm going to put it in this in 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.519
 medium of this connector and it gets up little 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.639
 little to this use click that 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.400
 disconnected then that way it is free 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.569
 stack ok 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.760
 and I have here the other stacked then 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.590
 this 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.980
 I will connect it in the same way 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.409
 so 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.390
 I have another video if you want to learn to 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.900
 see how those more classes come off 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.900
 parts 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.780
 as here is the charger port the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.330
 vibrator coaxial antenna cable 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 coax connect the wifi 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.880
 this is the connector that transfers the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.130
 energy to the battery 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.440
 so if we connect the room and this 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.540
 cable does not work does not transfer the energy 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.120
 in the whole stack does not charge and the phone 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.090
 technological 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.650
 then this 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.680
 so you know what are the cables that 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.950
 they connect that what they do is the vibrator 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.140
 As I said then if vibrator does not work 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.560
 you have to replace this piece if this one 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.930
 it helps us we have to pass everything 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.450
 it's not worth that the piece is not so expensive 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.220
 but if you know how to weld you can just 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.210
 replace this part of the case that the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.270
 port does not always charge the phone 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.710
 ok then let's connect the other 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.430
 stack is the other stack that I'm going to connect 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.300
 on the phone then we just put it 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.770
 and as in this case we no longer have to 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.760
 insert only with your fingers we can 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.900
 push the connector down 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.000
 we make sure it is correctly and 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.400
 we lower it with a click 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.310
 there it is already clicked and it is already 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.370
 connected this one 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.110
 and this stack is not not loaded then 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.520
 if visiting the phone is not going to 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.940
 to learn 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.860
 this dog 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.860
 I assure you it is the pile 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.909
 but if it has not loaded then this 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.909
 I will not load 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.990
 but 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.529
 we are going to put back the layer of 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.330
 behind that is covered this is 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:17.680
 loading 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.020
 here is the light is charging this 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.310
 I 'm not going to load later and now 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.879
 we are going to put this piece back is very 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.210
 important this to follow when you go to 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.850
 replace it 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.340
 you have to start from the corner 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.430
 from volume to 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.730
 to the power button so you do not 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.969
 damage because as I tell you this is very 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.159
 sensitive only there is a cablecito 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.129
 with a bit of pink with something and you can 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:52.759
 break then you have to start all 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:55.849
 also the volume is stuck but that 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:06:00.439
 cable cited delgadito that is 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:03.679
 connected to the logic table if it 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:07.399
 you put it wrong when you push it you can 

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:08.930
 break then to prevent it from being more 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:12.530
 expensive 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.100
 the compound with the composure we are going to 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.759
 start using is putting first the 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.130
 corner of the volume and above where is 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.130
 the power button we're going to 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.390
 set it correctly 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.200
 then already here 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.200
 It's on 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.080
 then if the button sees that it is not 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.730
 is very right then you have to 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.200
 accommodate what is well stuck in the 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.200
 wall before putting it is 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.490
 so 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:55.090
 once put there we push we push and 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:58.170
 then we already accommodate the others 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.170
 other corners 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.020
 to this one 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.819
 we still fully accommodate the layer 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.409
 from behind as it should be 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.509
 never remember to make sure that 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:22.750
 this first is correctly that 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:25.650
 place that is not this that you do not go to 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.040
 force the increase to accommodate it well 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.480
 and here we put the 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.050
 screws 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.000
 back and already the phone 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.200
 alcatel one touch first we already changed 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.200
 the battery and it's the way
