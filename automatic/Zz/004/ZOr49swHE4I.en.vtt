00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
coat of wax on there this dubbing dubs

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.489 
coat of wax on there this dubbing dubs
very<00:01:55.619> well<00:01:55.859> use<00:01:56.429> its<00:01:56.639> parsley<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.289> wrap

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
very well use its parsley when you wrap

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.300 
very well use its parsley when you wrap
it<00:01:59.749> but<00:02:00.749> the<00:02:00.899> wax<00:02:01.109> helps<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.069> it<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it but the wax helps really get it to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.289 
it but the wax helps really get it to
cinch<00:02:02.609> down<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.459> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.849> coarse

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
cinch down and it is kind of a coarse

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:17.410 
cinch down and it is kind of a coarse
dubbing<00:02:07.109> it's<00:02:07.679> not<00:02:07.889> real<00:02:08.130> fine

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
sparse them out just enough to cover the

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:34.830 
sparse them out just enough to cover the

thread you know and I'm showing you the
way<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.290> I<00:05:35.770> do<00:05:36.010> this<00:05:36.190> fly<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.970> it's<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.390> lot<00:05:38.260> of

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
way that I do this fly and it's a lot of

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.200 
way that I do this fly and it's a lot of
different<00:05:38.740> ways<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.070> skin<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.340> cat<00:05:39.610> as<00:05:39.820> they<00:05:39.940> say

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
different ways to skin a cat as they say

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.180

this<00:05:40.750> is<00:05:40.960> just<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.350> way<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.500> figured<00:05:41.680> out<00:05:42.070> how

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
this is just the way I figured out how

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.940 
this is just the way I figured out how
to<00:05:42.220> tie<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.580> there<00:05:43.390> might<00:05:43.690> be<00:05:43.720> other<00:05:44.289> ways<00:05:44.590> you

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
to tie it there might be other ways you

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.580 
to tie it there might be other ways you
might<00:05:45.880> have<00:05:46.120> another<00:05:46.720> way<00:05:46.930> all<00:05:47.080> together<00:05:47.380> if

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
might have another way all together if

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.670 
might have another way all together if
you<00:05:47.710> want<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:48.870> post<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:50.050> little<00:05:50.169> something<00:05:50.590> to
