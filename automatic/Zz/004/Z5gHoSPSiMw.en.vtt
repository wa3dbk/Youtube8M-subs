as the newer satellite radio capability

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.929 
as the newer satellite radio capability
antenna<00:01:49.039> let's<00:01:50.039> see<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.430> side<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.789> open

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
antenna let's see if this side is open

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.200 
antenna let's see if this side is open
yep<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.369> also<00:01:53.520> how<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.789> tell<00:01:54.060> if

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
yep it is this is also how you tell if
