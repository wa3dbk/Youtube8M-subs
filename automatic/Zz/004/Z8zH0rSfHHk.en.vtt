 where we are going to review the 5 keys of the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.580
 movie jurassic words that we hope 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.740
 with a lot of desire prepared is a 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.100
 little shy so we get the one with a 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.100
 applause 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.130
 first of all we expect a tribute to 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.050
 jurassic park the inaugural film of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.090
 this saga that made us crazy for the 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.489
 dinosaurs to more than one but all of it 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.110
 without losing the freshness of a new 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.530
 movie so let's see how you do it with 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.530
 trevor or 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.520
 look at me 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.170
 well in second place we hope that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.820
 chris pratt consolidates himself as he was 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 action because who knows if we could not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.570
 be talking about the next indi in fact 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.700
 of humans is the character that is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.560
 raising more expectation for what reason 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.090
 Well, very simple because it's going to establish 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.100
 a curious entente with the dinosaurs 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.949
 to deal with a superior threat 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.250
 here there are 20,000 people who do not have to 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.250
 where to go 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.870

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.040
