00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
see that on the video they got the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.740 
see that on the video they got the
batteries<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.239> got<00:02:12.720> the

batteries out of the can but you got the
idea

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
idea

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.050 
idea
kind<00:02:14.379> of<00:02:14.439> roll<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.890> over<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.310> little<00:02:15.549> bit<00:02:15.819> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
kind of roll that over a little bit and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.879 
kind of roll that over a little bit and
and<00:02:16.659> you'll<00:02:16.930> see<00:02:17.140> what<00:02:17.260> I'm<00:02:17.379> talking<00:02:17.409> about

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:17.889 
and you'll see what I'm talking about

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.920 
and you'll see what I'm talking about
now<00:02:18.879> what<00:02:19.569> we<00:02:19.689> had<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.409> one<00:02:20.650> was<00:02:20.889> I<00:02:21.930> used

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
now what we had on this one was I used

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.830 
now what we had on this one was I used
an<00:02:23.049> old<00:02:23.170> piece<00:02:23.469> of<00:02:23.499> composite<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:25.480> one<00:02:25.659> of<00:02:25.749> my

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
an old piece of composite from one of my

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.030 
an old piece of composite from one of my
deck<00:02:26.109> jobs<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:28.170> what<00:02:29.170> you'll<00:02:29.379> see<00:02:29.590> there's<00:02:29.829> we

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
deck jobs and what you'll see there's we

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.580 
deck jobs and what you'll see there's we
had<00:02:30.219> two<00:02:30.549> lights<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.540> dawn-to-dusk<00:02:31.900> or

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
had two lights on a dawn-to-dusk or

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.399 
had two lights on a dawn-to-dusk or
dusted<00:02:33.159> on<00:02:33.280> sensor<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.000> two<00:02:34.840> lights<00:02:35.109> on<00:02:35.379> a

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
dusted on sensor and two lights on a

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.039 
dusted on sensor and two lights on a
remote<00:02:35.799> control<00:02:37.409> two<00:02:38.409> of<00:02:38.590> them<00:02:38.769> are<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
remote control two of them are on the

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.140 
remote control two of them are on the
dusk<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.349> dawn<00:02:41.379> sensor<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.790> you'll

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
dusk to dawn sensor so that you'll

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.390 
dusk to dawn sensor so that you'll
always<00:02:43.689> have<00:02:43.900> red<00:02:44.230> light<00:02:44.499> under<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.010> feeder

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
always have red light under the feeder

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.709 
always have red light under the feeder
and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.040> other<00:02:48.069> ones<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:49.239> other<00:02:49.389> two

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719 
and then the other ones the other two

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.159 
and then the other ones the other two
are<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.409> a<00:02:50.439> remote<00:02:50.950> control<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.540> see<00:02:52.930> that

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
are on a remote control you can see that

00:02:53.169 --> 00:03:00.809 
are on a remote control you can see that
right<00:02:53.379> there<00:02:53.439> on<00:02:54.810> off<00:02:55.810> on<00:02:56.469> off<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.769> idea<00:03:00.189> or<00:03:00.549> my

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
right there on off on off the idea or my
