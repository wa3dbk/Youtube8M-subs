quite a while today paper mache

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.310 
quite a while today paper mache
now<00:00:09.389> we've<00:00:10.290> paper<00:00:10.530> my<00:00:10.800> shed<00:00:11.179> to<00:00:12.179> hild<00:00:12.420> us<00:00:12.719> go<00:00:13.200> on

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
now we've paper my shed to hild us go on

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.129 
now we've paper my shed to hild us go on
in<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> middle<00:00:14.269> in<00:00:15.269> front<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> centre<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
in the middle in front of the centre of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:16.849 
in the middle in front of the centre of
the<00:00:16.350> tunnel

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the tunnel

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
the tunnel
so<00:00:17.010> they're<00:00:17.430> both<00:00:17.609> separate<00:00:18.210> now<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
so they're both separate now but a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.859 
so they're both separate now but a
tunnel<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.500> hill<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.949> way<00:00:20.939> if<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.689> any

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
tunnel and a hill that way if I have any

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.060 
tunnel and a hill that way if I have any
problems<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> future<00:00:22.920> I'll<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.640> able<00:00:23.789> to

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
problems in the future I'll be able to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.679 
problems in the future I'll be able to
take<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> tunnel<00:00:26.400> off<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
take the tunnel off and get in at the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.810 
take the tunnel off and get in at the
tracks<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.199> need<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.439> well<00:00:29.660> likely<00:00:31.640> some<00:00:32.640> nice

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
tracks if need be well likely some nice

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.889 
tracks if need be well likely some nice
contours<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.780> think<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.300> nice<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.719> when

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
contours I think to be nice to know when

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.930 
contours I think to be nice to know when
it<00:00:37.020> dries<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.800> painted<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> just

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it dries out and it's painted and just

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.830 
it dries out and it's painted and just
some<00:00:39.210> scenery<00:00:39.540> 400<00:00:40.200> it'll<00:00:40.469> look<00:00:40.559> quite<00:00:40.829> well

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
some scenery 400 it'll look quite well

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.459 
some scenery 400 it'll look quite well
I'll<00:00:42.840> try<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:44.390> take<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> couple<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.899> days<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.289> dry

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I'll try to take a couple of days to dry

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
I'll try to take a couple of days to dry
I<00:00:46.500> guess<00:00:46.829> let's<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> from

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
I guess let's have a look at it from

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.010 
I guess let's have a look at it from
here<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.460> as<00:00:50.460> well<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.180> er<00:00:51.239> they're<00:00:51.870> not

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
here now as well as that er they're not

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
here now as well as that er they're not
properly<00:00:52.469> together<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.309> whatever<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:55.969> which<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
properly together or whatever so which I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
properly together or whatever so which I
just<00:00:57.539> looked<00:00:57.809> too<00:00:57.989> bad<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:58.620> see

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
just looked too bad you can actually see

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.660 
just looked too bad you can actually see
there<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> end<00:00:59.820> there<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:01.190> dark<00:01:02.190> air<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
there at the end there is dark air you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
there at the end there is dark air you
just<00:01:02.730> hear<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.750> would<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> end<00:01:04.979> no<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just hear that would be in the end no of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.850 
just hear that would be in the end no of
one<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> toilet<00:01:06.330> roads<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.229> kitchen<00:01:07.650> roads

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
one of the toilet roads or kitchen roads
or<00:01:08.130> whoever<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.790> well<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:10.020> always<00:01:11.720> go

back at a later stage and put a few more

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.390 
back at a later stage and put a few more
coats<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.350> toilet<00:01:16.830> tissue<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.130> was

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
coats of you know toilet tissue I was

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.300 
coats of you know toilet tissue I was
using<00:01:17.670> none<00:01:17.939> PVA<00:01:18.450> glue<00:01:18.540> over<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.830> top<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.189> up

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
using none PVA glue over to top it up

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
using none PVA glue over to top it up
and<00:01:20.520> camouflage<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and camouflage it as well but it will I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
and camouflage it as well but it will I
think<00:01:22.920> it'll<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.720> fine<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.170> we

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
think it'll you know to be fine if we

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.640 
think it'll you know to be fine if we
could<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.530> his<00:01:25.680> tunnel<00:01:25.950> organized<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
could get his tunnel organized the way I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830 
could get his tunnel organized the way I
want<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> off

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
want it to be I can take it on and off

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.100 
want it to be I can take it on and off
to<00:01:31.049> track<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.420> everything<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:33.990> be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
to track you know everything will be

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.440 
to track you know everything will be
fine<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:34.950> yeah<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.329> other

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
fine down but yeah and I think the other

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
fine down but yeah and I think the other
thing<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> learnt<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.200> well<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.950> you're

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
thing I learnt as well is this if you're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
thing I learnt as well is this if you're
a<00:01:38.189> working<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.759> something<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:40.200> you're

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
a working on something I think you're

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
a working on something I think you're
probably<00:01:40.619> always<00:01:41.100> better<00:01:41.280> off<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
probably always better off to do it on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.639 
probably always better off to do it on
something<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.229> down<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
something because that way down if you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
something because that way down if you
need<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> take<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.579> move<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.000> or

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
need to take it out or move it or

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.530 
need to take it out or move it or
whatever<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
whatever you can you can do that you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
whatever you can you can do that you
know<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.649> obviously<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.250> need<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
know that obviously will need to be

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.280 
know that obviously will need to be
trimmed<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.090> bit<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.450> around<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> edges

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
trimmed a bit now around the edges

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
trimmed a bit now around the edges
before<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.890> layered<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.670> its<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
before it's layered into its you know a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.609 
before it's layered into its you know a
final<00:01:54.869> resting<00:01:55.170> place<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:56.540> as<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.689> said<00:01:57.719> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
final resting place for as I said you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.700 
final resting place for as I said you
know<00:01:58.850> once<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.060> painted

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
know once it's painted
