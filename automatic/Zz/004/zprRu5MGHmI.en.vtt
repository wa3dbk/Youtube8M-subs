00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:41.399

 I prefer to dry my hair 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.570

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 masonry 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.509
 actually proceed to laying at 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.880
 help ironing for a start, I'll show you 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.799
 one way to quick straightening when 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.869
 I need literally in seconds 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.330
 get together at the same time so that the hair was 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.060
 smooth but above all 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.250
 Of course, thermal protection because always 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.289
 absolutely every time I use 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 iron i use thermal protection in order 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.000
 so as not to harm my hair i prefer 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.080
 thermal protection as a cream because it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.299
 it is better 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.420
 smooth the hair she does it somehow 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.770
 more heavier more elastic making it 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.770
 Klein does not dry them at all 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.440
 a large amount of money on the palm 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.440
 then distributed to the ends of hair 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.160
 . time means to eat so they 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.840
 Were not letters and proceed to laying 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.970
 I usually put up on my gut 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.070
 temperature is 180 degrees because 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.410
 such an average styling temperature 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.900
 for normal povlin she very quickly 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.740
 put my hair just look for tips i 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.450
 I divide my hair into 2 parts after that 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:32.290
 I divide somewhere else into two or three parts 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 each strand and slightly go through not 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.319
 I want to achieve the effect as much as possible 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.709

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.330

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.300
 then turn to ironing 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.170
 Now I turn to the top row shaft 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.519
 if I want to create a small volume 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.670
 at the roots I lift a strand of hair and 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.209
 I'm starting to pull the hair and so 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.209
