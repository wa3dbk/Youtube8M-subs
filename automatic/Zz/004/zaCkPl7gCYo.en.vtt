00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello, girls, how are you? 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.980
 that you are great today's video is going 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.779
 about special raincoats I 've 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.160
 rediscovered with the raincoats that 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.019
 I had my closet and the truth is that I 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.370
 He was a very good use for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.900
 at the time then so much so that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 you see in Spain we are a time a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 little spring going into summer 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 so that they see me the other 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.320
 side of the world that if it's rather in the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.910
 autumn transition something towards winter 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.670
 I think it's a garment that's going to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 help a lot as a shelter then 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.390
 I want to show the two clothes that I 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 I have the 23 not the 2 raincoats one is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 is that I bought it in a store that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.040
 it is called unique what there is not in Spain 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 but good that there are in other parts 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.579
 of the world and larraz that is a store that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.739
 Super cool is Japanese and has some 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.840
 very good basic and another is this other 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.969
 that I picked up pictures another store that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.590
 It's the French that you 've also 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 taught in the blog leave in the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.739
 description of this video two links to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 the looks I 've taken on my blog to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.430
 that you can see how they are put in a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 any club we're going to start with 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.910
 the first of the videos in them 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.989
 will show three looks that you can create with 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 this type of raincoats 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.350
 the first of the suggestions is the look 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.630
 preppy not that we call it a look 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.520
 kind of like schoolgirl not from 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.650
 Spanish university or collection 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.180
 American that you can basically 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.710
 get a very simple way that is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.870
 using a skinny jeans 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.340
 singles tight skinny looking for a 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.680
 seasonal color such as the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.090
 meat some flat dancers 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.070
 and then up you can choose a 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.450
 basic shirt normally for 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.040
 get this look more pretty more 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.750
 childish then look for shirts that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.729
 have certain childish motives in 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.009
 this case as you have chosen a puppy 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.780
 and also a detail as is a link in 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.270
 here in the back that also 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 helps to create that look more prep and 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.390
 He decides to add this bag and give it a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.430
 opportunity from bag that gave me 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.320
 nacho on one of his trips clear me 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.610
 it seemed a little childish but good yo 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 I think that with this preppy look 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.119
 phenomenal and good basically for this 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.160
 kind of looks you can also play with 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.500
 briefcase type handbags as you see in this 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.180
 case that is a bag like very school 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080
 not what is meant by the typical portfolio 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.490
 of school that I believe that nowadays 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 they are not very well either but 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.729
 traditionally they had this kind of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.320
 structure finally we add it 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.149
 our raincoat and you see how we have 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.380
 the first of the preppy look looks like 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.380
 it works great with this 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.349
 we go with the second proposal of luque 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 In this case, as you can see, we have gone from 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.159
 a look like more than a schoolgirl to a group 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.480
 more than working woman what happens that 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.670
 we believe that the office we have to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.620
 use the typical classic skirt more 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.700
 pencil style a blouse a little bit more 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.650
 Straight k modesty and a briefcase bag for 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.879
 go to work this would be the result already 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.530
 you are going to see what good is left when 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.450
 we incorporated the raincoat and I forgot 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.750
 we add a touch of color in the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750
 feet 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.910
 we go for the third one of the looks no 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.380
 it would be you but to the raincoats 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.450
 always remember as the detectives 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.550
 I do not know to Sherlock Holmes there is consume 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.810
 Kingfisher in the rainy night 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.400
 investigating well I was thinking 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.110
 that one of the looks we could create 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.730
 with raincoat really stays very 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.590
 cool are lux as more with a touch 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.090
 male for it is very simple 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.070
 you can choose for example in this case 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.200
 with the look in white and black and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.520
 you take and a vest salem salek or ya 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.230
 possible gives a masculine touch to 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.670
 whatever you put on and that's why 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.590
 decided to add only to this look in 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.600
 black and white the same shoes 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.040
 oxford oxford shoes also this 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.530
 touch of English that they have always 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.090
 gives you a more masculine touch and then a 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.410
 touch of color to be in spring 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.410
 with this orange bag 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.900
 and here we have arrived with these 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.730
 three first looks on how to dress 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.380
 with a raincoat that you know to have 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.540
 a second delivery of this video by 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.640
 popular request and nothing I hope that what 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.660
 you see this and the next one so that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.660
 I wait and see you next time
