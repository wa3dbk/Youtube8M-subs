a<00:00:49.860> composite<00:00:50.640> type<00:00:50.879> plant<00:00:51.260> probably<00:00:55.670> better

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
a composite type plant probably better

rough on the lower surface they're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
rough on the lower surface they're
tending<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.270> cop<00:01:09.979> role<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.340> Cup<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> smaller

newer<00:01:14.670> leaves<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.259> serrated<00:01:17.070> edges

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.429 

the<00:01:22.880> stems<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.150> pubescent<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the stems are pubescent with a little

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.620 
the stems are pubescent with a little
bit<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> red<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:25.920> them<00:01:28.430> these<00:01:29.430> leaves<00:01:30.090> are

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
bit of red in them these leaves are

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
bit of red in them these leaves are
larger<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.920> base<00:01:33.920> looks<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.159> several

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
larger at the base looks like several

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.230 
larger at the base looks like several
stems<00:01:35.939> emerge<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> leaves<00:01:39.030> at

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
stems emerge from the same the leaves at

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.020 
stems emerge from the same the leaves at
the<00:01:39.390> base<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.840> very<00:01:40.110> large<00:01:41.720> we<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:44.030> some

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the base are very large we have some

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.030 
the base are very large we have some
more<00:01:45.299> nearby

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.690 

so<00:01:51.140> until<00:01:52.140> Steve<00:01:52.409> will<00:01:52.680> take<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> sample<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so until Steve will take a sample of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.370 
so until Steve will take a sample of
this<00:01:54.680> also<00:01:56.630> for<00:01:58.040> photographing<00:01:59.040> and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
this also for photographing and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.679 
this also for photographing and
identification<00:02:01.789> bet<00:02:02.789> you<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.180> one's<00:02:03.479> not

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
identification bet you this one's not

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.460 
identification bet you this one's not
going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> too<00:02:04.530> hard<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.180> identify<00:02:06.470> based

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
going to be too hard to identify based

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.210 
going to be too hard to identify based
on<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:09.239> type<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.539> flower<00:02:09.989> cluster<00:02:10.679> we've<00:02:10.860> seen

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
on the type of flower cluster we've seen

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.089 
on the type of flower cluster we've seen
something<00:02:11.849> similar<00:02:12.390> last<00:02:13.110> year<00:02:13.530> uncle<00:02:13.890> Steve

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
something similar last year uncle Steve

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.809 
something similar last year uncle Steve
thinks<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.930> these<00:02:16.200> leaves<00:02:16.709> are<00:02:17.130> very<00:02:17.160> very

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
thinks but these leaves are very very

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.270 
thinks but these leaves are very very
distinctive<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.630> Steve<00:02:21.900> will

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
distinctive so I think the Steve will

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.100 
distinctive so I think the Steve will
scamper<00:02:23.280> back<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.700> his<00:02:23.850> car<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:27.299> take<00:02:27.900> with

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
scamper back to his car and take with

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.130 
scamper back to his car and take with
him<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.410> sample<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.700> provide<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:31.019> an

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
him a sample and provide you with an

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.830 
him a sample and provide you with an
identification<00:02:32.900> well<00:02:33.900> two<00:02:34.410> for<00:02:34.590> one

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
identification well two for one

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.509 
identification well two for one
until<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.989> next<00:02:37.140> floor<00:02:37.470> episode<00:02:37.980> uncle<00:02:38.310> Steve

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
until the next floor episode uncle Steve

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.230 
until the next floor episode uncle Steve
saying<00:02:39.230> adios
