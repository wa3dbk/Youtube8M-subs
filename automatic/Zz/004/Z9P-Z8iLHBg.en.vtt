 diagnosis and has in the area of 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:31.130
 specialties and it works as a 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.130
 saint than turkey since May 1987 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.110
 adding the three communities but as 148 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.010
 and employees, of which 61 are 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.010
 certain 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:05.010
 today with data in the early days of the company 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.030
 we invest heavily in technologies 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.480
 cutting edge 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.640
 resonance is one of the new 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.180
 provet strategies this brand has already been 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.540
 commissioned and we are in the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.540
 documentation aa deployment of this brand 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.979
 from the moment that the company passes 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.289
 growing 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.350
 You have to professionalize and do 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.789
 part of the professionalization also 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 management of your company 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.909
 It is important that you resolve your 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.909
 tax and labor issues and this 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.299
 management began to learn from the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.719
 management and teach the manager was not 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.549
 revealed was an exchange of information and 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.310
 knowledge that gives us 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:04.770
 precede and today people are quite 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:07.349
 more prepared but it is very 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.260
 important always takes into account 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:16.459
 not just us but the machines you 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.290
 You also have to have someone who pilots 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.590
 so it's I think it always aims 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.140
 to honor the people who 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.920
 work with us and work on these 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.739
 machines 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
 even because the people the companies are 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.040
 made of people 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.329
 I think it's clear that with rejection 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.329
 in this regard 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700
