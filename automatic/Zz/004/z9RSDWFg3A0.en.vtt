depending<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> plug-in<00:00:34.320> it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
depending on if you have a plug-in it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.700 
depending on if you have a plug-in it's
going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.220> battery<00:00:35.780> life<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.590> I've

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
going to have the battery life what I've

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340 
going to have the battery life what I've
done<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.309> would<00:00:38.840> there's<00:00:39.840> something<00:00:40.200> down

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
done is I would there's something down

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.280 
done is I would there's something down
here<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:40.920> losing<00:00:41.370> connection<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> would

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
here that's losing connection so I would

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.120 
here that's losing connection so I would
tap<00:00:43.470> on<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:45.140> sometimes<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.920> press

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.549 
tap on this sometimes like I can press
real<00:00:47.370> hard<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.570> you'll<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.290> them<00:00:49.440> maybe

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
real hard and you'll see them maybe

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
real hard and you'll see them maybe
flash<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.719> just<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:53.840> once<00:00:54.840> they

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
flash on just like that and once they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:05.060
