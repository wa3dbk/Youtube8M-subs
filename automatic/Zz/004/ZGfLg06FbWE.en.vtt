00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 Today I would like to ask you a question that I heard yesterday also to everyone you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 Rebuilt and bought or cd sells at all 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.900
 After all I have not been waiting for me to be waiting for various reasons are said to this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.020
 Because ipod was born , you can download it because youtube is ready 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.270
 Because it became 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.320
 The record company is the first time when the download type comes in response to various things 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.520
 Don't try to install a boot on your computer by saying to the control cd 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:38.980
 To or Martha first so-so many that are said but I've been kneaded soccer 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.010
 I think that probably is all wrong several times and everything is wrong 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.460
 To various people 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.430
 How do you feel like it's sold out during the sunny days 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:54.680
 1982 era dream I was born handicraft well that you will be asked that I because I think that such 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 It is such a cd in almost the same year as the country, but it is likely to reach many homes 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.740
 Beneath music was also born cd love human beings as I am taken for granted that the kids 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.130
 Now it's cd I remember the title 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.400
 I mark the end of time or even to say'll it be one that has been a woman reflects is my idea 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.810
 The 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:19.060
 Is not it have collapsed to have prospered enormously, because is not it likely Datte Rover 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.800
 It is tempting to think that anything will last forever as it develops, but there is a form 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.760
 Things are gone 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.150
 The best example of that is cd 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.260
 I have a bow if I don't think it's because the cd is not sold 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.500
 Whether the music is over and not so great lately 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.060
 Where it is also amusing also fes fes fes fes 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.350
 although cd is not to buy Datte annual summer female contains the terrible people in the old haunt 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 This has changed is what is required that is, to be Bambang sold out 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.010
 Follow 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.020
 It is a thing cd 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:53.610
 The experience of being sold raw rather than packaged like records 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.810
 It is that I came to be asked for entertainment that I can do, I love it 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.930
 Singer apple is not saying such a thing I am of Tokyo Olympics 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.030
 Before you want to run a cabaret cb is no good anymore 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.360
 It will be raw and it will be exhausted to the personnel of Mr. Nagu who is also a student of sea ​​cucumber 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.100
 It's just the latest cd 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:17.860
 There is no riders, I will be with someone else. Idol now. 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:24.020
 However, I was added to the voting ticket for that general election, but still cd 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:28.160
 Sell It is extremely large base of a 2 of Kodansha, depending on the course hidden composer arranger Oh 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:32.900
 Such commercial law will probably continue in the future, as it is taken by the artist Gar 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.250
 I also think that this is capitalism, that is, I said in today's video 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.020
 I wanted to 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.460
 The decline in sales of cds The Internet has become mainstream and ipods are in the stage 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.010
 So my conclusion is that I might have already understood, but I am 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.350
 After all 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:54.000
 Open the governor of the package is the heart of the now to the moment I saw the artwork and lyrics card 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.500
 I will probably not change the feeling for the rest of my life, so packaged music 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.060
 I think it seems like it will become some fans or collectors to keep buying 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 I think that today's video is about everyone's recent music situation here 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.099
