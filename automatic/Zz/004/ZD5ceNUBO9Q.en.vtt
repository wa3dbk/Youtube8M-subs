00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I think that's an S step too many and I

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.810 
I think that's an S step too many and I
wish<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.070> could<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.340> link<00:01:53.640> directly

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
