unprecedented<00:03:58.290> circumstance<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> president

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889

potentially<00:04:02.049> large<00:04:02.260> legal<00:04:03.190> bills<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.730> it's<00:04:03.849> I

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
potentially large legal bills and it's I

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.250 
potentially large legal bills and it's I
