00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm Ayoub I started free running I was around 12

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's my everyday life, now, a part of it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's obvious that I have another vision of the city

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The walls, the barriers seems different
I pay attention to materials

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a fight against yourself, your fears

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The goal of this sport is to go beyond your own limits

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The XTreme Gravity, it will be for me a new challenge

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
An obstacle to overcome, to go further

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Because we never stop learning
