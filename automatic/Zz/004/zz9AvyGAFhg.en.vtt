00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Welcome back to minecraft 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.480
 until today, of course, the fogra the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.150
 yes the debitor and the brother last 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.330
 follow to the 30th 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.440
 and today as one of the dealers lp 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello and how I am today 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.320
 archery a new variant of the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.160
 archery game this time in duel 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.689
 actually works quite easy 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.170
 everyone is going to arrow right here 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.600
 to get 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 you can check out in any case ever 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 Part and bow how much you need 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 take the box out so that the deal 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.640
 will play on the left side and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.750
 the spark on the right and it is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.250
 actually pretty easy you have to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.520
 actually only the ten wood knock 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 meet when all ten are hit 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.940
 he looks at every wood power he brings 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 nor the lamp on you know the gate 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 hit it when all ten hit 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.640
 have built a rescue circuit 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.690
 which causes the platform of the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.160
 opponent withdraws and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.280
 accordingly fat opponents in the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.899
 deep and death are played 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.329
 maximum five rounds 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.289
 Who including 3 wins is the winner, 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.199
 what else is there to say oh yes 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.510
 minecraft as I said plays the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.540
 like to follow the arrows 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.770
 about one to one and a half minutes 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.390
 You can not prevent that from happening 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.189
 just like that but maybe easy 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 an additional difficulty that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.369
 is always the same time you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 do you need this build so nothing 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.509
 unfair turn or so if you want 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.830
 probably already on your platform where front 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.820
 go on it opened the door and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 take care of that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 you do not finish 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 best also take care that I do not 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.650
 alone you should fall under the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 leyen falling down is still considered 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.619
 lost 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.710
 So take care only bundled 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.240
 will stifter squat happened a mix yes 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.619
 or would i say i reload now 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.090
 again briefly the server with it for you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.700
 About microsoft came that I have to me 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 accustomed as well as loud comes over completely 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.960
 An already time then I would say 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.920
 can start their times 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.500
 Ok folk demand or you already before 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
 goal signal 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:06.719
 you are allowed you are allowed fabric protects against 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.899
 the Secretary then at listless 321 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.960
 and of course that's it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.460
 our latest our latest creation 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.790
 I have little idea of archery 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.770
 we you are really troops on 1 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.450
 but if you only times the distance out 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.010
 you have to use about it 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.810
 yes , that could be true 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.970
 actually with each block but with 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.970
 Apply to every button pretty much the same 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.670
 So I have it I have it anyway 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.260
 still managed the ten fall directly 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.450
 to clean one after the other without problems 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.620
 and will now concert before bad 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.060
 crazy there the wild animal 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.410
 probably still remember as advisory 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.000
 that's always true now 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.459
 he really good is just such a 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 time to get there you need 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.830
 probably more than round for 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.360
 to get in there we need this 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.540
 fuck zack zack and then it really is 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.580
 stop the faster is okay 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.480
 canceled because the now is now the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.420
 Verein further ahead two further ahead 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.980
 No, but you know you want to know 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 Can you start with the arrows 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.959
 spurs and then of course would have to 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.959
 start at the beginning 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:33.750
 get euro relationships or is first 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:33.750
 already good does not bother me about the same 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.190
 but I do not think that's an advantage 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.079
 power yes so okay i go for a short time 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:04:02.590
 Accumulated collecting collectively pretends to be nine 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:04:05.620
 bow arrows have another take out 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.930
 and it will be spontaneously Italy 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.799
 just wanted to say yes I 've got 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.510
 to make said yes 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:20.970
 minute ca there is all tactics 1 0 for 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.970
 the late two side ready 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.120
 okay now with listless three two one 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.120
 and off 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.710
 I would like to watch the game 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:45.410
 just before 3 0 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:47.270
 right now , unfortunately, has now out like it 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:53.390
 I think there has the bow out 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.920
 yes, there you are okay me 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:01.360
 believe the thing is that we are here 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:06.680
 it's pretty clear like that and 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.080
 Ice cold always nice as you 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.290
 I have to say it's a great year 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:22.310
 so could already be prepared next 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:26.270
 you'll be left beside that so now 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.530
 Losing bird is my collecting 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.820
 Sorry the platform box is driving 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.240
 only out again when all the things 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.200
 disabled are back 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.730
 Of course I could wait until the 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.330
 But this is not the lonely thing 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.430
 more quickly 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:55.790
 so here's just a construct that my 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:59.150
 windows set everything was okay now 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.220
 you 're losing out to stricter at 210 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.470
 from delay so let 's go are you 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.530
 ready 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.520
 dreizweieins and go to any 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.440
 last round 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.440
 maybe it is right again 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.220
 what's happening 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.630
 Now he has thrown the stefan rhine 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.930
 who was that not funny no matter who 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.930
 that was 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.869
 help what is you going to do what in the beginning 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.669
 first round you almost won and 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:36.050
 now you have to be so unlikely here 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:38.159
 the problem is that no on 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.499
 okay, this is not too extreme 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.379
 minecraft is the same thing you have on 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:45.180
 won first players did not have 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.919
 Too much to do with minecraft is the 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.249
 now as minecraft took place 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.789
 but it was just he thinks so and 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:55.830
 Combination game and games of chance 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:58.289
 Last game also partially what is 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:06.419
 Now go now, but right now 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:07.680
 works here is true now anyway 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:12.210
 clearly ahead I did not see it 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.069
 can including fallen and also, and 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.529
 one estimates so that the fugger earlier 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:18.709
 had died 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:21.330
 very cold that is if that too 

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:23.249
 manufacturer and was but without 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.959
 clear box but also the last 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:27.830
 was now working properly you have 

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:27.830
 yes both closed under it 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.599
 the music circle and wish 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.849
 it was cool 

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:40.020
 that actually has a game with red 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:43.680
 steelers but flying will have that 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:48.749
 of course the game happens too often 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:52.559
 not at all times was so cool the game 

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:54.569
 tip yes cool breeze is his focus 

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:56.159
 but relatively high up in the highscore 

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:58.439
 namely together with the debitor on 

00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:01.169
 second place if I'm not mistaken and 

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:03.169
 with brother there in the race and enters the 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:06.599
 next round against with different 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:09.569
 and I would say next time 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:11.809
 exactly petted, yes, I'm exactly right 

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:11.809
 can
