00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
like soft light overlay it's still a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.680 
like soft light overlay it's still a
little<00:03:49.280> too<00:03:49.430> much<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.760> solve<00:03:50.150> flight<00:03:50.359> nice

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
little too much to solve flight nice

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.349 
little too much to solve flight nice

clean I pass how does it look it's
already<00:03:53.540> starting<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.900> look<00:03:53.959> better<00:03:54.049> but<00:03:54.650> it

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
already starting to look better but it

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.069 
already starting to look better but it
does<00:03:54.949> need<00:03:55.129> some<00:03:55.340> tweaking<00:03:55.549> now<00:03:56.359> one<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:56.959> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
does need some tweaking now one of the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.479 
does need some tweaking now one of the
things<00:03:57.139> that<00:03:57.410> we<00:03:57.500> brought<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:57.980> when<00:03:58.459> we

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
things that we brought in when we

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.800 
things that we brought in when we
brought<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:58.910> in<00:03:59.120> was<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.299> little<00:03:59.599> bit<00:03:59.720> of

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
brought this in was a little bit of

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.500 
brought this in was a little bit of
noise<00:03:59.959> in<00:04:00.290> our<00:04:00.530> shadows<00:04:00.919> easy<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:02.090> take<00:04:02.299> care

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
noise in our shadows easy to take care

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.759 
noise in our shadows easy to take care
of<00:04:02.569> I'm<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:03.079> going<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.379> do<00:04:03.530> something

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
of I'm actually going to do something

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.740 
of I'm actually going to do something
that<00:04:03.949> most<00:04:04.129> people<00:04:04.250> probably<00:04:04.519> don't<00:04:04.699> do<00:04:05.030> but

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
that most people probably don't do but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.500 
that most people probably don't do but
just<00:04:06.049> go<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.709> filter<00:04:07.099> go<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.609> noise<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.209> go<00:04:08.239> to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
just go to filter go to noise and go to

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.869 
just go to filter go to noise and go to
dust<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.410> scratches<00:04:09.680> again<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.519> is<00:04:10.669> a<00:04:10.699> high

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
dust and scratches again this is a high

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.750 
dust and scratches again this is a high
pass<00:04:11.090> level<00:04:11.329> or<00:04:11.629> high<00:04:11.989> pass<00:04:12.199> sharpen<00:04:12.680> layer<00:04:12.829> so

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
pass level or high pass sharpen layer so

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.550 
pass level or high pass sharpen layer so
we<00:04:13.970> aren't<00:04:14.120> too<00:04:14.419> worried<00:04:14.750> about<00:04:14.930> losing<00:04:15.169> any

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
we aren't too worried about losing any

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.420 
we aren't too worried about losing any
detail<00:04:16.519> per<00:04:17.359> se<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.079> image

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
detail per se in the image

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.860 
detail per se in the image
so<00:04:18.639> Dustin<00:04:19.000> scratch<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.389> actually<00:04:19.780> an

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
so Dustin scratch is actually an

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.629 
so Dustin scratch is actually an
acceptable<00:04:20.410> thing<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.620> use<00:04:20.859> just<00:04:21.459> use<00:04:21.579> a

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
acceptable thing to use just use a

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.029 
acceptable thing to use just use a
radius<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.449> for<00:04:22.690> your<00:04:22.780> pixels<00:04:23.169> what

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
radius of one for your pixels what

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.920 
radius of one for your pixels what
that's<00:04:24.190> going<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.370> do<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.759> clean<00:04:25.060> up<00:04:25.090> any<00:04:25.479> of

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
that's going to do is clean up any of

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.680 
that's going to do is clean up any of
that<00:04:26.110> noise<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:27.789> we<00:04:27.880> were<00:04:28.000> seeing<00:04:28.210> up<00:04:28.419> here

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
that noise that we were seeing up here

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.659 
that noise that we were seeing up here
let's<00:04:29.380> go<00:04:29.470> back<00:04:29.650> here<00:04:29.680> see<00:04:30.100> how<00:04:30.190> it's<00:04:30.310> clean<00:04:30.490> up

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
let's go back here see how it's clean up

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.580 
let's go back here see how it's clean up
that<00:04:30.820> noise<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.539> a<00:04:31.600> little<00:04:31.750> bit<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.139> just<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
that noise just a little bit I just you

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.939 
that noise just a little bit I just you
know<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.919> mean<00:04:33.400> oh<00:04:33.960> now<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.229> want<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.560> hike<00:04:35.680> up<00:04:35.830> the

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
know I mean oh now I want to hike up the

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.469 
know I mean oh now I want to hike up the
saturation<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.610> little<00:04:36.820> bit<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.240> I'm<00:04:37.330> going<00:04:37.449> to

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
saturation a little bit so I'm going to

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.499 
saturation a little bit so I'm going to
go<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.680> hue/saturation<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.120> want<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.360> hike

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
go to hue/saturation and I want to hike

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.909 
go to hue/saturation and I want to hike
up<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.780> saturation<00:04:41.320> typically<00:04:41.740> in<00:04:41.830> his

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
up the saturation typically in his

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.400 
up the saturation typically in his
eyeball<00:04:42.130> which<00:04:42.639> i<00:04:42.850> think<00:04:42.910> is<00:04:43.360> in<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.720> Reds<00:04:43.930> let

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
eyeball which i think is in the Reds let

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.560 
eyeball which i think is in the Reds let
me<00:04:44.500> let<00:04:44.830> me<00:04:44.889> take<00:04:45.039> a<00:04:45.070> look<00:04:45.280> yep<00:04:46.060> there's<00:04:46.419> some

me let me take a look yep there's some
of<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.750> Reds<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.410> we'll<00:04:47.560> go<00:04:47.620> ahead<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:47.830> use<00:04:47.979> it

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
of the Reds so we'll go ahead and use it

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.700 
of the Reds so we'll go ahead and use it
a<00:04:48.160> little<00:04:48.250> bit<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.550> Reds<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:49.139> then<00:04:50.139> a

on<00:05:07.479> this<00:05:07.660> layer<00:05:07.900> mask<00:05:08.169> I<00:05:08.440> can<00:05:08.800> paint<00:05:09.130> in<00:05:09.400> white

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
on this layer mask I can paint in white

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.060 
on this layer mask I can paint in white
over<00:05:10.630> his<00:05:10.810> eye<00:05:10.990> where<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.500> want<00:05:11.800> that

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
over his eye where I want that

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.279 
over his eye where I want that
saturation<00:05:12.639> to<00:05:13.000> come<00:05:13.180> back<00:05:13.770> very<00:05:14.770> cool<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.990> I

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
saturation to come back very cool but I

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.870 
saturation to come back very cool but I
also<00:05:17.530> did<00:05:17.889> like<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.250> fact<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:18.580> there<00:05:18.759> was

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
also did like the fact that there was

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.810 
also did like the fact that there was
some<00:05:19.030> saturation<00:05:19.240> coming<00:05:19.960> through<00:05:20.820> through

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
some saturation coming through through

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.029 
some saturation coming through through
his<00:05:21.940> skin<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.449> some<00:05:22.750> lanuite<00:05:23.039> hue/saturation

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
his skin to some lanuite hue/saturation

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.490 
his skin to some lanuite hue/saturation
again<00:05:24.970> make<00:05:25.389> another<00:05:25.659> hue/saturation<00:05:25.900> there

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
again make another hue/saturation there

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.290 
again make another hue/saturation there
and<00:05:26.710> just<00:05:26.949> kind<00:05:27.190> of<00:05:27.250> bring<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:27.669> saturation

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
and just kind of bring that saturation

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.930 
and just kind of bring that saturation
up<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.659> little<00:05:28.870> bit<00:05:29.880> +<00:05:31.320> 25<00:05:32.320> again<00:05:32.979> people<00:05:33.760> want

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
up a little bit + 25 again people want

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.189 
up a little bit + 25 again people want
to<00:05:34.000> be<00:05:34.060> there<00:05:34.210> five<00:05:34.419> minutes<00:05:34.630> not<00:05:34.870> seven

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
to be there five minutes not seven

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.399 
to be there five minutes not seven
minutes<00:05:35.440> let's<00:05:35.830> go<00:05:35.949> plus<00:05:36.310> 25<00:05:37.949> so<00:05:40.080> it's<00:05:41.080> still

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
minutes let's go plus 25 so it's still

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.290 
minutes let's go plus 25 so it's still
doing<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:41.830> little<00:05:42.010> too<00:05:42.310> much<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.909> eyeball

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
doing a little too much to the eyeball

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.500 
doing a little too much to the eyeball
on<00:05:44.159> too<00:05:45.159> much<00:05:45.280> saturation<00:05:45.760> that<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.030> ballin<00:05:46.389> out

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
on too much saturation that I ballin out

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.450 
on too much saturation that I ballin out
doing<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.870> so<00:05:47.860> I'm<00:05:47.949> going<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.099> do<00:05:48.190> is<00:05:48.280> press

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
doing that so I'm going to do is press

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.909 
doing that so I'm going to do is press
alt<00:05:48.729> click<00:05:49.479> on<00:05:49.599> the<00:05:49.720> mask<00:05:49.930> that's<00:05:50.169> on<00:05:50.349> the<00:05:50.470> hue

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
alt click on the mask that's on the hue

saturation<00:05:51.070> layer<00:05:51.610> below<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:51.970> and<00:05:52.180> drag<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.780> up

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
saturation layer below it and drag it up

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.159 
saturation layer below it and drag it up
or<00:05:53.979> place<00:05:54.190> it<00:05:54.220> say<00:05:54.669> yes<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.120> now<00:05:55.930> i'm<00:05:56.020> going<00:05:56.110> to

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
or place it say yes and now i'm going to

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.320 
or place it say yes and now i'm going to
invert<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.560> mask<00:05:57.039> which<00:05:57.849> is<00:05:57.880> going<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.240> go

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
invert that mask which is going to go

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.429 
invert that mask which is going to go
ahead<00:05:58.449> and

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.869 

push<00:06:03.439> away<00:06:03.590> all<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.039> saturation<00:06:04.580> that<00:06:04.669> was<00:06:04.759> on

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
push away all the saturation that was on

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.999 
push away all the saturation that was on
the<00:06:04.969> eyeball<00:06:05.389> because<00:06:05.809> it's<00:06:06.710> basically

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
the eyeball because it's basically

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.549 
the eyeball because it's basically
inverse<00:06:07.550> and<00:06:07.729> that's<00:06:07.909> below<00:06:08.120> it<00:06:09.879> go<00:06:10.879> to<00:06:10.939> curves

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:11.559 
inverse and that's below it go to curves

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.869 
inverse and that's below it go to curves
it's<00:06:12.559> always<00:06:12.680> good<00:06:12.919> to<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.129> curves<00:06:13.460> layer<00:06:13.669> on

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879 
it's always good to the curves layer on

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:20.200 
it's always good to the curves layer on
there<00:06:15.460> and<00:06:16.460> just<00:06:16.900> play<00:06:18.669> typically<00:06:19.669> an<00:06:19.849> s-curve

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
there and just play typically an s-curve

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.959 
there and just play typically an s-curve
pull<00:06:20.809> the<00:06:21.129> black<00:06:22.129> down<00:06:22.339> a<00:06:22.400> little<00:06:22.580> bit<00:06:22.759> and

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
pull the black down a little bit and

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.409 
pull the black down a little bit and

pull the white up a little bit typically
it's<00:06:26.659> good<00:06:26.779> for<00:06:26.990> you<00:06:27.490> now<00:06:28.490> if<00:06:28.879> this<00:06:30.879> tonemapped

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
it's good for you now if this tonemapped

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.079 
it's good for you now if this tonemapped
high<00:06:32.659> path<00:06:32.990> sharpen<00:06:33.589> layer<00:06:33.620> is<00:06:33.889> too<00:06:34.129> much<00:06:34.310> you

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:35.089 
high path sharpen layer is too much you

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.550 
high path sharpen layer is too much you
can<00:06:35.210> always<00:06:35.300> control<00:06:35.719> it<00:06:35.810> with<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.199> with<00:06:36.529> the

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
can always control it with the with the

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.070 
can always control it with the with the
opacity<00:06:36.860> slider<00:06:37.249> you<00:06:37.669> can<00:06:37.819> drop<00:06:38.479> that<00:06:38.539> opacity

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
opacity slider you can drop that opacity

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.300 
opacity slider you can drop that opacity
down<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.289> little<00:06:39.439> bit<00:06:39.650> or<00:06:39.889> bring<00:06:40.069> it<00:06:40.159> up<00:06:40.249> a

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
down a little bit or bring it up a

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.219 
down a little bit or bring it up a
little<00:06:40.430> bit<00:06:40.639> but<00:06:41.419> the<00:06:41.509> big<00:06:41.719> question<00:06:41.749> you<00:06:42.139> have

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
little bit but the big question you have

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.050 
little bit but the big question you have
to<00:06:42.259> ask<00:06:42.379> yourself<00:06:42.560> here<00:06:42.949> is<00:06:43.099> are<00:06:43.759> we<00:06:43.879> better

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
to ask yourself here is are we better

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.760 
to ask yourself here is are we better
off<00:06:44.150> now<00:06:44.479> than<00:06:44.509> they<00:06:44.779> were<00:06:44.810> four<00:06:45.199> years<00:06:45.229> ago<00:06:45.469> I

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
off now than they were four years ago I

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.950 
off now than they were four years ago I
mean<00:06:45.979> four<00:06:46.430> minutes<00:06:46.699> ago<00:06:46.849> yeah<00:06:47.360> four<00:06:47.810> minutes

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
mean four minutes ago yeah four minutes

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.070 
mean four minutes ago yeah four minutes
ago<00:06:48.139> sorry<00:06:49.009> it's<00:06:49.159> a<00:06:49.599> democratic<00:06:50.599> talk<00:06:50.839> or

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
ago sorry it's a democratic talk or

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.519 
ago sorry it's a democratic talk or
republican<00:06:51.830> whatever<00:06:52.069> is<00:06:52.189> going<00:06:52.339> on<00:06:52.460> I<00:06:53.529> think

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529 
republican whatever is going on I think

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.179 
republican whatever is going on I think
we<00:06:54.620> are<00:06:54.879> quick<00:06:55.879> and<00:06:55.909> drag<00:06:56.210> on<00:06:56.419> your<00:06:56.449> layers<00:06:56.749> and

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 
we are quick and drag on your layers and

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.860 
we are quick and drag on your layers and
you<00:06:58.189> see<00:06:58.399> we<00:06:58.550> brought<00:06:58.999> out<00:06:59.149> the<00:06:59.300> dynamic<00:06:59.749> range

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
you see we brought out the dynamic range

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.139 
you see we brought out the dynamic range
we<00:07:00.499> haven't<00:07:00.889> necessarily<00:07:01.069> made<00:07:01.669> this<00:07:01.819> a<00:07:01.879> high

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:02.149 
we haven't necessarily made this a high

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:03.670 
we haven't necessarily made this a high
dynamic<00:07:02.360> range<00:07:02.629> because<00:07:03.169> it's<00:07:03.319> multiple

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
dynamic range because it's multiple

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.909 
dynamic range because it's multiple
exposures<00:07:04.219> because<00:07:04.729> of<00:07:04.849> a<00:07:04.969> frog<00:07:05.240> or<00:07:05.449> toad<00:07:05.930> for

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
exposures because of a frog or toad for

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.950 
exposures because of a frog or toad for
the<00:07:06.979> sake<00:07:07.129> of<00:07:07.159> argument<00:07:07.689> it's<00:07:08.689> kind<00:07:08.839> of

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
the sake of argument it's kind of

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.320
