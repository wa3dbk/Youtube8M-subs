and it will come apart it has a number

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.040 
and it will come apart it has a number
of<00:00:39.570> gears<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.309> plastic<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
of gears it's all plastic and there is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.860 
of gears it's all plastic and there is
rack-and-pinion<00:00:43.890> set<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.850> everywhere<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
rack-and-pinion set up everywhere as you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770 
rack-and-pinion set up everywhere as you
can<00:00:46.379> see<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> crack<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
can see I have a crack here and it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
can see I have a crack here and it's
making<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.530> gear<00:00:49.739> difficult<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> maneuver

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
making the gear difficult to maneuver

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
making the gear difficult to maneuver
I'm<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.480> sure<00:00:51.809> whether<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I'm not sure whether I can get a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.840 
I'm not sure whether I can get a
replacement<00:00:53.699> part<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.170> wish<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.399> had<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
replacement part or not I wish I had a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.200 
replacement part or not I wish I had a
3d<00:00:57.329> printer<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> print<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> II<00:00:58.940> let's<00:00:59.940> take<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
3d printer to print that II let's take a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.680 
3d printer to print that II let's take a
look<00:01:00.480> from<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.320> side<00:01:02.030> let's<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> closer

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
look from this side let's have a closer

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.969 
look from this side let's have a closer
look<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.530> gears<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.090> plastic<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
look at the gears it's all plastic I

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
look at the gears it's all plastic I
think<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.760> difficult<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> these

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
think it's really difficult to get these

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.149 
think it's really difficult to get these
parts<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:11.250> regular<00:01:11.760> stores<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.470> three

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
parts from regular stores we have three

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.420 
parts from regular stores we have three
switches<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.909> top<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.560> turn<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
switches here top one is to turn on the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.390 
switches here top one is to turn on the
LED<00:01:17.909> light<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> helps

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
LED light it's not much but it helps

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.149 
LED light it's not much but it helps
middle<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.930> turn<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> motor<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.740> or

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
middle one is to turn the motor on or

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.810 
middle one is to turn the motor on or
off<00:01:23.310> when<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.509> machine<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.439> stitch

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
off when it's on machine will stitch

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.929 
off when it's on machine will stitch
automatically<00:01:26.820> bottom<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.680> adjust

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
automatically bottom one is to adjust

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
automatically bottom one is to adjust
stitching<00:01:29.939> speed<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.079> set<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.650> high<00:01:32.130> or

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
stitching speed we can set it in high or

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.170 
stitching speed we can set it in high or
low<00:01:32.909> position

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180 

behind<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.390> switches<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.560> switch

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
behind these switches we have switch

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.480 
behind these switches we have switch
mounts<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.270> small<00:01:42.600> motor<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.680> side<00:01:43.980> we

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
mounts and a small motor at the side we

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.570 
mounts and a small motor at the side we
have<00:01:44.640> slots<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.330> pedal<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.840> AC<00:01:46.320> adapter<00:01:46.580> when

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
have slots for pedal and AC adapter when

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.030 
have slots for pedal and AC adapter when
the<00:01:47.670> motor<00:01:47.850> runs<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.510> moves<00:01:49.080> top<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.650> bottom

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the motor runs it moves top and bottom

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.360 
the motor runs it moves top and bottom
parts<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.830> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
parts like this and that's how the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:01.140 
parts like this and that's how the
machine<00:01:53.760> works

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.350 

I'm<00:02:01.210> going<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.260> put<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:02.860> all<00:02:03.040> together

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
I'm going to put it all together

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.330 
I'm going to put it all together
starting<00:02:04.360> from<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.990> top<00:02:05.260> put<00:02:05.740> all<00:02:05.920> screws

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
starting from the top put all screws

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.050 
starting from the top put all screws
back<00:02:07.120> in<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.570> that's<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.710> that's<00:02:09.640> how<00:02:10.000> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
back in and that's it that's how you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.990
