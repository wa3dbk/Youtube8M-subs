00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.800
 another side because exiles claimed to be this channel 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.329
 san second channel 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.730
 well 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 because the ere 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 this balance was confirmed 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.879
 even more the nation to do something useful by René Alonso but with drunks 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.350
 Benicarlo 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.950
 but it happens is equal to equal to new resistance panacea panacea but 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.820
 good chile on the part of your viii on the part of the ico that you already do with your touch 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.080
 they would not be so 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.070
 Well, I decided to make this pruning as a queen 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.940
 like if we drink and we take a pain 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.220
 but instead of the paid situation 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.239
 that is as if we were to check some more intimate explained 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.570
 I think so 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 but descending 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.289
 that is to say little less emission and all those things 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.420
 what we are going to follow then will be a little more intimate as 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.000
 already a Christian in the bars that it will not be like that 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.439
 we will preserve the need 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.760
 that your comments le alm de bankia will discuss if they do not 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 there was only one balloon 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.620

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.160
 zaccheroni 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.540
 3 when creating danger 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.540
 after consulting your ranks of erc 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.200

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.919

 sao paulo 11 Aug everything points to an operation on the ropes 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.909
