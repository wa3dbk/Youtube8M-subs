control also on the 3gs you get a longer
the<00:02:38.250> battery<00:02:38.580> life<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.030> little<00:02:39.420> better<00:02:39.540> you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
the battery life is a little better you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.430 
the battery life is a little better you
can<00:02:41.180> talk<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> long<00:02:42.600> time<00:02:42.930> without<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
can talk for a long time without the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.150 
can talk for a long time without the
battery<00:02:43.590> dying<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.420> even<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.560> like

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
battery dying you can even you can like

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
surf the web for a longer time you know

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.800 
surf the web for a longer time you know
what<00:02:53.130> battery<00:02:53.580> life<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:53.910> much<00:02:54.180> longer<00:02:54.570> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
what battery life is just much longer so

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.390 
what battery life is just much longer so
you<00:02:54.990> can<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> bunch<00:02:55.440> stuff<00:02:55.560> more<00:02:55.920> for<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> long

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
you can do a bunch stuff more for a long

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.850 
you can do a bunch stuff more for a long
time<00:02:57.620> all<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> pretty<00:03:01.110> much<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.770> was

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
time all right so pretty much that was

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.890 
time all right so pretty much that was
the<00:03:02.040> comparison<00:03:02.640> I'm<00:03:03.270> going<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.510> show<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:04.130> how

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the comparison I'm going to show you how

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.130 
the comparison I'm going to show you how
to<00:03:06.900> record<00:03:07.320> videos<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> 3g<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.960> pretty

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
to record videos with a 3g so it pretty

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.920 
to record videos with a 3g so it pretty
much<00:03:10.230> still<00:03:10.710> equals<00:03:11.070> out<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.280> price<00:03:11.930> there's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
much still equals out the price there's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.880 
much still equals out the price there's
really<00:03:13.140> no<00:03:13.320> point<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:14.090> choosing<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.350> 3gs<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.680> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
really no point of choosing a 3gs if you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.480 
really no point of choosing a 3gs if you
can<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.070> get<00:03:17.310> everything<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.240> 3g<00:03:19.490> all

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
can just get everything on the 3g all

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.350 
can just get everything on the 3g all
right<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.970> app<00:03:21.210> is<00:03:21.510> called<00:03:22.340> video<00:03:23.360> genius

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
video but it's going to run at about 30

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.620 
video but it's going to run at about 30
frames<00:03:49.950> per<00:03:50.070> second<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.640> 25<00:03:51.120> i<00:03:51.150> believe<00:03:51.540> i'm

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
frames per second like 25 i believe i'm

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.690 
frames per second like 25 i believe i'm
not<00:03:51.780> really<00:03:51.900> sure<00:03:52.020> 25<00:03:52.470> or<00:03:52.590> 30<00:03:52.770> so<00:03:53.520> it's<00:03:53.610> going

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
not really sure 25 or 30 so it's going

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.650 
not really sure 25 or 30 so it's going
to<00:03:53.760> be<00:03:53.820> really<00:03:54.000> nice<00:03:54.300> and<00:03:54.510> smooth<00:03:56.480> pretty<00:03:57.480> much

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
to be really nice and smooth pretty much

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.120 
to be really nice and smooth pretty much
like<00:03:57.870> most<00:03:58.080> cameras<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.709> camera

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
like most cameras like the camera

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.770 
like most cameras like the camera
recording<00:03:59.550> with<00:03:59.670> right<00:03:59.850> now<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> think<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.510> 30

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
recording with right now I think it's 30

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.630 
recording with right now I think it's 30
frames<00:04:01.020> per<00:04:01.080> second<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.400> going<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.580> be

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
frames per second so it's going to be

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.699 
frames per second so it's going to be
pretty<00:04:02.700> close<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.239> one<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:04.050> one<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.470> you
