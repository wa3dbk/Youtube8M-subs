Janet and this is the third video in my
series<00:00:04.560> on<00:00:05.069> how<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.279> use<00:00:05.549> cheat<00:00:05.970> engine<00:00:06.120> in

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
series on how to use cheat engine in

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.070 
series on how to use cheat engine in
order<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.839> hack<00:00:07.020> almost<00:00:07.680> any<00:00:08.010> game<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.760> your<00:00:08.880> PC

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
order to hack almost any game on your PC

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.940 
order to hack almost any game on your PC
so<00:00:10.080> today<00:00:11.010> we're<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.880> look<00:00:12.450> at

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
so today we're going to have a look at

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.049 
so today we're going to have a look at
encrypted<00:00:13.950> values<00:00:14.519> obviously<00:00:14.880> if<00:00:14.940> we're

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
encrypted values obviously if we're

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.990 
encrypted values obviously if we're
going<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> use<00:00:15.389> cheat<00:00:15.960> engine<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.859> well<00:00:17.789> what

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
going to use cheat engine and well what

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170 
going to use cheat engine and well what
do<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.300> mean<00:00:18.570> by<00:00:18.680> encrypted<00:00:19.680> values<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.670> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
do we mean by encrypted values now so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.450 
do we mean by encrypted values now so
far<00:00:21.449> we've<00:00:21.689> learned<00:00:21.930> how<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> find<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.279> byte

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
far we've learned how to find for byte

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.620 
far we've learned how to find for byte
values<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> other<00:00:25.350> value<00:00:26.310> types<00:00:26.670> okay

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
values and other value types okay

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.950 
values and other value types okay
simply<00:00:28.470> by<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.590> scanning<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.480> value

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
simply by just scanning for that value

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.069 
simply by just scanning for that value
now<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.949> cases<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.730> developer<00:00:33.270> will

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
now in some cases the developer will

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.190 
now in some cases the developer will
have<00:00:34.969> foreseen<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.510> people<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:36.989> try

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
have foreseen that some people will try

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.600 
have foreseen that some people will try
to<00:00:37.320> hack<00:00:37.559> his<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.020> he<00:00:40.020> will<00:00:40.230> have

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
to hack his game and he will have

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.910 
to hack his game and he will have
changed<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:42.090> stuff<00:00:42.390> around<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
changed some stuff around so what you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
changed some stuff around so what you
can<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.489> example<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.969> you're<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> developer

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
can do for example if you're a developer

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.709 
can do for example if you're a developer
is<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.430> something<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:47.940> simple<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
is you can do something as simple as a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.069 
is you can do something as simple as a
multiply<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> value<00:00:50.129> by<00:00:50.910> 8<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> see

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
multiply of the value by 8 so if you see

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.400 
multiply of the value by 8 so if you see
a<00:00:52.110> money<00:00:52.620> value<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.910> 1<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a money value that is 1 that then the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
a money value that is 1 that then the
value<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> cheat<00:00:56.280> engine<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.390> your

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
value in cheat engine or in a your

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.490 
value in cheat engine or in a your
process<00:00:58.320> will<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> 8<00:00:59.000> okay<00:01:00.000> all<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.320> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
process will be 8 okay all right well in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.340 
process will be 8 okay all right well in
this<00:01:01.649> case<00:01:01.890> even<00:01:02.430> worse<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.870> case<00:01:04.110> what

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this case even worse in this case what

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
this case even worse in this case what
day<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.769> decided<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.729> multiply<00:01:06.030> by<00:01:06.600> 8

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
day it decided to do is multiply by 8

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
day it decided to do is multiply by 8
and<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.530> 6<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.770> awful

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and at 6 which is really really awful

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.030 
and at 6 which is really really awful
just<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> hacker<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
just you know for a hacker if you're a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.940 
just you know for a hacker if you're a
hacker<00:01:14.189> it'll<00:01:14.760> take<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.780> time<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.770> figure

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
hacker it'll take some time to figure

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
hacker it'll take some time to figure
that<00:01:17.189> value<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:17.759> okay<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> really

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that value out okay so this is a really

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
that value out okay so this is a really
common<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.420> developer<00:01:22.170> Stubbe<00:01:22.530> by

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
common thing that a developer Stubbe by

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.420 
common thing that a developer Stubbe by
the<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.610> flash<00:01:23.909> games<00:01:24.360> they'll<00:01:24.630> just

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
the way in flash games they'll just

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
the way in flash games they'll just
multiply<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> value<00:01:26.880> by<00:01:27.030> 8<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.479> no<00:01:27.869> idea

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
multiply the value by 8 I have no idea

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.700 
multiply the value by 8 I have no idea
why<00:01:28.799> okay<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:31.020> trying<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> hack<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
why okay so now if I'm trying to hack a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
why okay so now if I'm trying to hack a
flash<00:01:31.979> game<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.490> always<00:01:32.520> try<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.689> multiply

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
flash game I always try to just multiply

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.480 
flash game I always try to just multiply
the<00:01:34.229> value<00:01:34.680> by<00:01:34.829> 8<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.700> works<00:01:36.079> surprisingly

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the value by 8 and it works surprisingly

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
the value by 8 and it works surprisingly
you<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.610> surprisingly<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.450> works<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.750> lot<00:01:39.930> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you know surprisingly it works a lot so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.100 
you know surprisingly it works a lot so
ok<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> show<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> how<00:01:42.630> we

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
ok I'm just going to show you how we

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.210 
ok I'm just going to show you how we
would<00:01:43.320> usually<00:01:43.590> handle<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.049> um<00:01:46.220> let's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
would usually handle this so um let's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
would usually handle this so um let's
say<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.579> don't<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> encryption<00:01:48.840> okay<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
say we don't know the encryption okay I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
say we don't know the encryption okay I
do<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> encryption<00:01:50.310> obviously<00:01:51.119> because

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
do know the encryption obviously because

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
do know the encryption obviously because
I've<00:01:51.600> already<00:01:51.930> hacked<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.500> game<00:01:52.860> before<00:01:53.130> but

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
I've already hacked this game before but

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
I've already hacked this game before but
now<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> act<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.560> didn't

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
now I'm just going to act as if I didn't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.569 
now I'm just going to act as if I didn't
know<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.590> scan<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.100> an

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
know so what we do is we scan for an

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.499 
know so what we do is we scan for an
unknown<00:02:00.530> initial<00:02:01.530> value<00:02:02.250> ok<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.240> will

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
unknown initial value ok this will

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.499 
unknown initial value ok this will
basically<00:02:03.689> scan<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> values<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.180> this

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
basically scan all the values in this

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.249 
basically scan all the values in this
process<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.520> yeah<00:02:08.750> then<00:02:09.750> I'm<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> show

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
process and yeah then I'm going to show

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770 
process and yeah then I'm going to show
you<00:02:10.319> how<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.590> proceed<00:02:11.129> now<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:12.270> we're<00:02:12.480> going

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you how we proceed now what we're going

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.100 
you how we proceed now what we're going
to<00:02:12.840> have

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110 
to have
do<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.440> we're<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.220> change<00:02:14.670> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
do is we're going to have to change that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.240 
do is we're going to have to change that
value<00:02:15.390> okay<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> sell<00:02:16.830> some<00:02:17.040> stuff

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
value okay I'm going to sell some stuff

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.660 
value okay I'm going to sell some stuff
so<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.790> value<00:02:18.330> will<00:02:18.630> increase<00:02:19.520> okay<00:02:20.520> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
so the value will increase okay and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.490 
so the value will increase okay and
we're<00:02:20.850> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.000> use<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.750> our<00:02:21.780> advantage

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
we're going to use that to our advantage

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.090 
we're going to use that to our advantage
Celal<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.320> see<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.740> value

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
Celal all right as you can see my value

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.880 
Celal all right as you can see my value
is<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.460> 40<00:02:27.180> higher<00:02:27.330> than<00:02:27.660> before<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.740> now

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
is now 40 higher than before we can now

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.450 
is now 40 higher than before we can now
do<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.550> go<00:02:29.700> into<00:02:29.940> cheat<00:02:30.270> engine<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.460> we

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
do is we can go into cheat engine and we

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.880 
do is we can go into cheat engine and we
can<00:02:33.560> say<00:02:34.730> scan<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.210> all<00:02:36.570> increased<00:02:37.320> values

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
can say scan for all increased values

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
can say scan for all increased values
okay<00:02:38.730> next<00:02:39.420> scan<00:02:39.980> okay<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.610> that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
okay next scan okay that have that

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.230 
okay next scan okay that have that
eliminated<00:02:42.650> about<00:02:43.650> 22<00:02:44.070> million<00:02:44.340> values<00:02:45.000> right

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
eliminated about 22 million values right

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.590 
eliminated about 22 million values right
there<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.800> that's<00:02:46.800> how<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.070> proceed<00:02:47.370> now<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
there and that's how we proceed now and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.870 
there and that's how we proceed now and
now<00:02:48.780> I'm<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.350> buy<00:02:49.530> stuff<00:02:49.950> buy<00:02:50.640> one

of those I'm going to go for decreased
value<00:02:55.130> next<00:02:56.130> scan<00:02:57.260> again<00:02:58.260> we<00:02:58.440> got<00:02:59.400> rid<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.610> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
value next scan again we got rid of a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.810 
value next scan again we got rid of a
million<00:03:00.120> there<00:03:00.620> I'm<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.800> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.040> buy<00:03:02.489> some

million there I'm just going to buy some
more<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:05.150> obviously<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.510> values<00:03:07.670> now

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
more and obviously the values now

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.729 
more and obviously the values now
decrease<00:03:09.330> again<00:03:09.510> obviously<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.590> we

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
decrease again obviously because we

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.320 
decrease again obviously because we
bought<00:03:10.950> something<00:03:11.310> next<00:03:11.790> scan<00:03:14.330> decrease

decrease again next scan and can I buy

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.050 
decrease again next scan and can I buy
more<00:03:23.340> okay

decrease again in next scan and as you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.880 
decrease again in next scan and as you
can<00:03:27.480> see<00:03:27.690> after<00:03:28.080> you're<00:03:28.350> done<00:03:28.440> there's<00:03:28.709> like

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
can see after you're done there's like

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.990 
can see after you're done there's like
six<00:03:29.670> seven<00:03:30.000> times<00:03:30.709> already<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.890> have<00:03:32.489> only

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
six seven times already I have only

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.720 
six seven times already I have only
twenty<00:03:33.660> three<00:03:33.690> values<00:03:34.260> laughs<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.920> actually

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
twenty three values laughs that actually

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
twenty three values laughs that actually
it<00:03:36.090> works<00:03:36.980> surprisingly<00:03:37.980> fast<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:39.120> mean<00:03:39.510> I'm

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
it works surprisingly fast I mean I'm

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.330 
it works surprisingly fast I mean I'm
just<00:03:39.840> going<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.230> sell<00:03:40.470> some<00:03:40.680> stuff<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
just going to sell some stuff so the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.479 
just going to sell some stuff so the
valuable<00:03:41.760> increase<00:03:42.239> again<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:43.470> I'm<00:03:44.310> just

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
valuable increase again and I'm just

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.229 
valuable increase again and I'm just
going<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.700> go<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.330> increased<00:03:46.260> value<00:03:47.239> next

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
going to go for increased value next

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.470 
going to go for increased value next
scan<00:03:48.480> we're<00:03:48.959> left<00:03:49.140> with<00:03:49.320> 15<00:03:50.209> now<00:03:51.209> we're<00:03:51.360> left

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
scan we're left with 15 now we're left

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.130 
scan we're left with 15 now we're left
with<00:03:51.660> eight<00:03:52.310> now<00:03:53.310> we're<00:03:53.580> left<00:03:53.790> with<00:03:54.239> three<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
with eight now we're left with three and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.930 
with eight now we're left with three and
I<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.230> already<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:55.980> two<00:03:56.459> values<00:03:56.880> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
I can already see the two values that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.330 
I can already see the two values that
are<00:03:57.120> correct<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.650> I'm<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.010> going<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> do

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
are correct and I'm just going to do

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.210 
are correct and I'm just going to do
this<00:03:59.400> again<00:03:59.580> crease<00:04:00.330> value<00:04:01.040> okay

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
this again crease value okay

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.820 
this again crease value okay
and<00:04:03.560> there<00:04:04.560> we<00:04:04.650> go<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:06.049> after<00:04:07.049> about<00:04:07.200> what<00:04:07.680> was

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
and there we go now after about what was

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.370 
and there we go now after about what was
that<00:04:08.040> maybe<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.519> didn't<00:04:09.299> actually<00:04:09.959> keep<00:04:10.140> count

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
that maybe I didn't actually keep count

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.000 
that maybe I didn't actually keep count
but<00:04:10.500> after<00:04:11.040> about<00:04:11.519> 14<00:04:12.329> rotations<00:04:13.019> I've<00:04:13.590> come

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
but after about 14 rotations I've come

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.830 
but after about 14 rotations I've come
from<00:04:14.430> what<00:04:15.299> was<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.630> like<00:04:16.010> 20<00:04:17.010> million<00:04:17.519> or<00:04:18.299> 24

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
from what was it like 20 million or 24

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.500 
from what was it like 20 million or 24
million<00:04:19.169> values<00:04:19.829> I've<00:04:20.070> come<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.400> two<00:04:20.669> okay<00:04:21.030> so

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
million values I've come to two okay so

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.900 
million values I've come to two okay so
it<00:04:22.320> works<00:04:23.120> surprisingly<00:04:24.120> fast<00:04:24.450> even<00:04:25.110> if

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
it works surprisingly fast even if

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.740 
it works surprisingly fast even if
values<00:04:26.210> are<00:04:26.480> encrypted<00:04:27.440> okay<00:04:27.970> so<00:04:28.970> that's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
values are encrypted okay so that's

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.640 
values are encrypted okay so that's
basically<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.470> if<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:32.780> developer<00:04:33.320> has

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
basically that if the developer has

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.050 
basically that if the developer has
chosen<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.460> multiply<00:04:34.970> by<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.330> negative<00:04:36.110> number

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
chosen to multiply by a negative number

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.360 
chosen to multiply by a negative number
then<00:04:38.060> well<00:04:38.810> that's<00:04:38.960> just<00:04:39.200> bad<00:04:39.500> then<00:04:40.100> you'll

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
then well that's just bad then you'll

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.100 
then well that's just bad then you'll
have<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.790> do<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.060> whole<00:04:41.240> thing<00:04:41.270> in<00:04:41.600> Reverse

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
have to do the whole thing in Reverse

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
have to do the whole thing in Reverse
but<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.950> almost<00:04:43.250> never<00:04:43.820> happens

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
but that almost never happens

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.710 
but that almost never happens
I<00:04:44.900> literally<00:04:45.680> never<00:04:46.610> had<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.090> happen<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.600> me

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
I literally never had that happen to me

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.840 
I literally never had that happen to me
okay<00:04:48.050> what<00:04:48.590> they'll<00:04:48.800> do<00:04:49.010> is<00:04:49.250> they'll<00:04:49.640> multiply

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
okay what they'll do is they'll multiply

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.630 
okay what they'll do is they'll multiply
by<00:04:50.480> some<00:04:50.960> number<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.920> positive

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
by some number that is positive

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.830 
by some number that is positive
obviously<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:54.280> what<00:04:55.280> they'll<00:04:55.730> do<00:04:55.940> then<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.570> if

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
obviously and what they'll do then is if

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.590 
obviously and what they'll do then is if
they're<00:04:57.080> really<00:04:57.680> really<00:04:57.920> evil<00:04:58.820> they'll<00:04:59.330> just

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
they're really really evil they'll just

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.500 
they're really really evil they'll just
add<00:04:59.810> something<00:05:00.290> on<00:05:00.590> top<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.520> that's

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
add something on top of that and that's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.710 
add something on top of that and that's
about<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:03.050> okay<00:05:03.530> and<00:05:04.540> yeah

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
about that okay and yeah

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.290 
about that okay and yeah
that<00:05:05.870> almost<00:05:06.380> always<00:05:06.710> works<00:05:07.220> if<00:05:07.490> anything

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
that almost always works if anything

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.180 
that almost always works if anything
else<00:05:08.570> does<00:05:09.020> not<00:05:09.260> work<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:09.710> these<00:05:09.920> two<00:05:10.160> values

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
else does not work so these two values

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.030 
else does not work so these two values
correspond<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.180> my<00:05:11.390> gold<00:05:12.290> I'm<00:05:12.560> just<00:05:12.770> going<00:05:12.950> to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
correspond to my gold I'm just going to

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.800 
correspond to my gold I'm just going to
take<00:05:13.400> them<00:05:13.580> down<00:05:13.760> into<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.060> list<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.540> change

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
take them down into the list and change

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.950 
take them down into the list and change
them<00:05:15.140> in<00:05:15.260> order<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.560> demonstrate<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.810> what

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
them in order to demonstrate so what

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.450 
them in order to demonstrate so what
they<00:05:18.080> basically<00:05:18.320> did<00:05:18.710> is<00:05:19.010> they<00:05:19.850> multiplied<00:05:20.510> by

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
they basically did is they multiplied by

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.610 
they basically did is they multiplied by
just<00:05:22.460> going<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.670> sell<00:05:23.600> something<00:05:23.930> buy

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
just going to sell something buy

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.560 
just going to sell something buy
something<00:05:24.650> as<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.580> can<00:05:25.670> see<00:05:25.820> my<00:05:26.000> values<00:05:26.360> now

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
something as you can see my values now

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.650 
something as you can see my values now
add<00:05:26.720> ten<00:05:27.490> hundred<00:05:28.490> thousand<00:05:28.850> I<00:05:28.940> mean<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.570> what

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
add ten hundred thousand I mean so what

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.080 
add ten hundred thousand I mean so what
they<00:05:29.810> did<00:05:29.870> basically<00:05:30.260> is<00:05:30.530> they<00:05:31.130> multiplied<00:05:31.880> by

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
they did basically is they multiplied by

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.910 
they did basically is they multiplied by
eight<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.660> eight<00:05:32.690> hundred<00:05:33.200> thousand<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.800> they

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
eight so eight hundred thousand and they

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.690 
eight so eight hundred thousand and they
added<00:05:34.100> six<00:05:34.630> which<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.890> is<00:05:36.890> really<00:05:37.220> an<00:05:37.520> evil

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
added six which is is really an evil

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.260 
added six which is is really an evil
thing<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.300> do<00:05:38.420> I<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:39.170> I<00:05:39.290> mean<00:05:39.590> not<00:05:40.070> that<00:05:40.100> I<00:05:40.310> evil

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
thing to do I and I mean not that I evil

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.630 
thing to do I and I mean not that I evil
are<00:05:41.450> anything<00:05:41.810> but<00:05:41.990> it's<00:05:42.500> it's<00:05:42.950> kind<00:05:43.250> of<00:05:43.370> you

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
are anything but it's it's kind of you

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.760 
are anything but it's it's kind of you
know<00:05:43.700> hard<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.300> figure<00:05:44.480> out<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:45.560> as<00:05:45.620> you<00:05:45.710> can

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
know hard to figure out so as you can

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.830 
know hard to figure out so as you can
see<00:05:45.830> I<00:05:46.010> can<00:05:46.190> now<00:05:46.370> change<00:05:46.730> that<00:05:47.030> value<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:47.630> if<00:05:47.750> I

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
see I can now change that value so if I

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.950 
see I can now change that value so if I
wanted<00:05:48.140> 1<00:05:48.410> million<00:05:48.919> oh<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:50.060> know<00:05:50.390> 10<00:05:50.660> million

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
wanted 1 million oh you know 10 million

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.710 
wanted 1 million oh you know 10 million
for<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:51.500> matter<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:52.100> would<00:05:52.310> go<00:05:52.520> for<00:05:52.970> 80

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
for that matter I would go for 80

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.870 
for that matter I would go for 80
million<00:05:55.840> and<00:05:56.840> add<00:05:57.230> six<00:05:57.710> on<00:05:57.890> top<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.220> that<00:05:58.400> okay

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
million and add six on top of that okay

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.820 
million and add six on top of that okay
and<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.360> know<00:05:59.630> it<00:05:59.750> should<00:05:59.930> have<00:06:00.050> 10<00:06:00.290> million<00:06:00.530> as

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
and I know it should have 10 million as

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.740 
and I know it should have 10 million as
you<00:06:01.220> can<00:06:01.340> see<00:06:01.520> 10<00:06:02.919> million<00:06:03.919> good<00:06:04.340> ok<00:06:04.910> so<00:06:05.120> that

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
you can see 10 million good ok so that

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.630 
you can see 10 million good ok so that
works<00:06:06.020> and<00:06:06.490> yeah<00:06:07.570> there<00:06:08.570> is<00:06:08.950> ok<00:06:09.950> that<00:06:09.980> actually

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
works and yeah there is ok that actually

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.340 
works and yeah there is ok that actually
is<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:10.940> technique<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.540> we<00:06:11.810> use<00:06:12.050> if

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
is the technique that we use if

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.970 
is the technique that we use if
everything<00:06:12.770> else<00:06:12.950> fails<00:06:13.730> now<00:06:14.660> I<00:06:15.140> might<00:06:15.560> make<00:06:15.770> a

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
everything else fails now I might make a

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.060 
everything else fails now I might make a
next<00:06:16.730> video<00:06:16.850> because<00:06:17.270> there's<00:06:17.990> also<00:06:18.320> values

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
next video because there's also values

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.630 
next video because there's also values
that<00:06:19.400> get<00:06:19.970> you<00:06:20.390> know<00:06:20.570> we<00:06:21.050> written<00:06:21.500> all<00:06:21.950> over

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
that get you know we written all over

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.850 
that get you know we written all over
time<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:23.540> if<00:06:23.660> you<00:06:23.750> want<00:06:23.930> to<00:06:24.020> hack<00:06:24.110> this<00:06:24.470> that's

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
time and if you want to hack this that's

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.070 
time and if you want to hack this that's
kind<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:25.040> tricky<00:06:25.220> too<00:06:25.820> if<00:06:26.210> you<00:06:26.660> guys<00:06:26.780> are

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
kind of tricky too if you guys are

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.040 
kind of tricky too if you guys are
interested<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.740> will<00:06:28.130> make<00:06:28.370> a<00:06:28.610> fourth<00:06:29.510> video<00:06:29.840> in

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
interested I will make a fourth video in

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.980 
interested I will make a fourth video in
