00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
microsoft cert test so i think 4j

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.049 
microsoft cert test so i think 4j
Studios<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.589> really<00:00:41.830> working<00:00:42.040> on<00:00:42.250> trying<00:00:42.940> to

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
Studios is really working on trying to

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.369 
Studios is really working on trying to
hand<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.300> over<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.570> microsoft<00:00:44.020> cert<00:00:44.200> test

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
hand this over to microsoft cert test

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.680 
hand this over to microsoft cert test
and<00:00:44.649> not<00:00:44.829> just<00:00:45.219> rush<00:00:45.520> it<00:00:45.700> on<00:00:46.059> you<00:00:46.239> guys<00:00:46.390> and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
and not just rush it on you guys and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.639 
and not just rush it on you guys and
that's<00:00:46.750> one<00:00:47.020> thing<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.290> have<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.469> remember

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
that's one thing you have to remember

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.250 
that's one thing you have to remember
that<00:00:48.100> they<00:00:48.969> don't<00:00:49.180> want<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.420> rush<00:00:49.660> an<00:00:49.870> update

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
that they don't want to rush an update

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.220 
that they don't want to rush an update
so<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:50.800> think<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.550> later<00:00:51.789> we<00:00:52.030> get<00:00:52.210> it<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.899> more

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
so I think the later we get it the more

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.500 
so I think the later we get it the more
likely<00:00:54.039> chance<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.489> have<00:00:54.670> less<00:00:54.879> bugs<00:00:55.210> of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
likely chance we have less bugs of

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.200 
likely chance we have less bugs of
course<00:00:56.079> so<00:00:57.010> just<00:00:57.430> just<00:00:57.550> stay<00:00:57.730> patient<00:00:57.969> I'm

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
course so just just stay patient I'm

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.700 
course so just just stay patient I'm
trying<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.510> stay<00:00:58.629> patient<00:00:58.780> as<00:00:59.079> i<00:00:59.199> can<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.590> is

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
trying to stay patient as i can to is
