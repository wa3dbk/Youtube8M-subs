00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.570
 in a mountain called the path of the cross of the sacred mother located in garlic 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.429
 Korea 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.610
 a site that serves for the representations of the way crucis 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.460
 There, before the gaze of the faithful, an unprecedented event occurred. 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.470
 the top of the mountain they found traces of what could be the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.249
 travel of a person with whom he feels 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.810
 a journey marked by drops of blood and pieces of meat 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.050
 the members of this curious event 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.500
 they could feel that Jesus Christ was really going in front of them suffering his 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.300
 passion 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.600
 but not only that 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.840
 5-1 m testimony 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 all were marked 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.360
 more Muslims than it seems that the drops of blood and pieces of flesh do not 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.840
 they come from another side more than from the same sky 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 after this fact they were given the task of analyzing the blood that was in 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.530
 one of the stones at Seoul National University in the hospital of 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.790
 forensic sciences of nafo and they got in that it was human blood petit goave 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830
 the same guy as Jesus Christ 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.890
 and that curiously kept cool 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 contrary to the known rules of biology since after five 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.110
 this time it cools 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.080
 also 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.800
 that the stone that was flowing surprisingly more and more blood and 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.840
 and if that was not enough 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 I had a pulse if one 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 thousands of religious vows and some curious people from all over the world 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.740
 world have come to this place to be eyewitnesses 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 this impressive fact 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.270
 same as you already what in this report 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.390
 after serious scientific investigations everything 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.200
 something that could be treated 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.770
 related miracles directly 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.510
 to the passion of Jesus Christ 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.329
 that through this one 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.449
 invites us to conversion 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.049
 and to prayer 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.700
