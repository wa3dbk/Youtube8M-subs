00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.850
 hi to all with that of tests 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.770
 mobile.fr I'm at mwc 2015 on the 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.049
 lenovo stand there are some products 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.379
 especially motorola products too 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.650
 had no novelty and there I have before 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.600
 me the p70 which was unveiled at the beginning 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.490
 of year finally there is no there is a beginning 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.400
 February for the Chinese market 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.220
 it's a product that has a particularity 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.770
 it's having a rather big battery 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.739
 let's not stop according to point 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.780
 central who ultimately represents 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.820
 interest in late his greatest interest 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.120
 finally and it's up to a battery of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.649
 4000 miles and loses at level 2 of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.410
 rest of the specs we have a 5 inch screen 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.590
 hd y ps we had to have a media library 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.840
 64-bit octo cores at 1.7 gigahertz 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.680
 we have a 3 megapixel camera to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.860
 the back 5 in the front 2 gigas of ram 16 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 gigabytes of internal memory and it's lt them 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.760
 yes ltee category 4 I think I believe 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.800
 and it is dual sim 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.820
 he turns on a micro sim there he turns 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.320
 on android kit kat 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.300
 I will show it to you like that very 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.770
 quickly because final we even know 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.540
 not if he will arrive in France because he has 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.190
 been announced for China but I do 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.070
 I go around the design very 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.860
 quickly so here we have a device that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.869
 is relatively ip children pretty thick 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.610
 but rather compact because they have 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.830
 a size has a screen size that is 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.149
 not that is not huge 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.570
 here it is a little open the cause of 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.090
 the cause of security but it's good 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.410
 it's good it's good so sorry 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.670
 the light is not very good I 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.050
 tried to make adjustments in addition y'a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.479
 people who walk behind that makes 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.729
 move the tripod is like that 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.340
 on the lounges there we have the camera 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.520
 front end the audio output we have some 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.140
 buttons here too so here it's going to be 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.599
 menu here is home and back on the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.479
 right we have everything that is volume and a 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:05.920
 egg lock unlock high 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.340
 micro usb speakers nothing left 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.509
 the jack the camera years old who's going to be 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.190
 maybe interesting too it's from 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.390
 linger quickly finally linger 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.030
 quickly it's not compatible but 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 linger on the interface where you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.880
 see where you have to all who has 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.480
 shortcut in quick access them 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.880
 notifications then as on others 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.860
 terminals 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.110
 which can be seen especially at huawei's 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.320
 no menu for your applications 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.840
 so everything goes on the home and there is air 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.630
 to have pretty cool themes so there 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.070
 we have a lease with legs m 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.610
 the possibility to put themes if you 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:48.450
 feel like multitasking that comes from 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.340
 that way the messages with the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.830
 basic keyboard I do not know if we have a 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.680
 this we have other keyboard not his 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.680
 basic android keyboards that is proposed 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.440
 these are the contacts presented like that 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.980
 there is a small overlayer anyway but 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.260
 she is not very very very present 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.550
 calendar ok but who ok okay 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.410
 can switch from one month to another as 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.920
 here and there you have the details of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.850
 days it's the week if I'm wrong 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.890
 not being displayed that actually starts 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.450
 Sunday 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.770
 no no actually starting the day that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.770
 you select here is just below 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.280
 what else do we have that can be 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.070
 interesting I would live well at 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.850
 the camera interface is this 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:47.780
 that she is there then the camera there 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:51.030
 is hidden where is it going to be in toc toc knock 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.230
 we have a guy any record what is this 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.070
 that there is in space a recorder 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:02.090
 Sekurit that it has a camera 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.090
 she was hidden 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.630
 Fashion Beauty Fashion Tracking Way 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.010
 to do the focus during during the 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.620
 movement 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.920
 there is a fashion that must be at home 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.850
 low 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.250
 we will see what it is not written 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.260
 no that's if it's a mode no it's 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.420
 not a mode I do not know ah yeah we did 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.590
 some frames also to I did 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.430
 plant the device ok I do them 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.590
 planting it does not matter 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.810
 hop we pass on what is next to 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.990
 finish with him which is a theme 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.820
 different so it's interesting 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.290
 and here I think he uses that's it 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.340
 also integrates the applications the 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.550
 yandex widgets 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.960
 I think it's very Russian yandex if 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.190
 I am wrong and we are and where we are 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.720
 was in the camera if I get there 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:58.669
 to find him he is in a folder 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.900
 maybe in turn this name also no 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.520
 it does not matter it was just for 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.340
 show what this terminal looks like 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.260
 quickos wayne will not linger there 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.760
 above it's mission it's a 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.710
 bet that seems interesting to see if 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.960
 come to France and that one I did 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.000
 completely planted it's a shame on 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.750
 the salons often cdo yielded proto so 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.070
 it's normal 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.070
 see you soon
