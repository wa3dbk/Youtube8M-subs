00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.999
 so that will probably ask for trouble up to the lips on mine 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.619
 that reduces the costs comes to do nothing 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.619
 a number of looks are concerned 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.859
 also in the other 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.739
 that's what i can do it comes down to whatever is even more popular too 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.670
 offers the plan 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.970
 that falls down 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.480
 below 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 also is the capital markets 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.789
 is worth mentioning too 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.660
 this to the tens of thousands of euros 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 in the piece by piece in between was informed several times 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.860
 also fall like that 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.450
 iberdrola euros 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.500
 I think so 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.510
 mainly due to the turn 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.030
 on the second and third 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.820
 before that came 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.860
 the euro crisis
