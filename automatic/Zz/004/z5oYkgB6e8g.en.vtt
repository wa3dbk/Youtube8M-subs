00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.240 
in 2011 we included in the baat class
which<00:01:02.120> meant<00:01:02.390> we've<00:01:02.600> moved<00:01:02.839> to<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.079> weekend<00:01:03.559> to

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
which meant we've moved to a weekend to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.450 
which meant we've moved to a weekend to
give<00:01:04.400> us<00:01:04.489> an<00:01:04.549> additional<00:01:05.000> day<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.570> competition

give us an additional day of competition
and<00:01:07.460> when<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:07.729> did<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.150> we<00:01:08.540> moved<00:01:09.200> lay<00:01:09.710> out

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
and when we did that we moved lay out

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.830 
and when we did that we moved lay out
the<00:01:10.159> event<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:11.299> had<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.509> little<00:01:11.659> bit

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
the event so that we had a little bit

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.570 
the event so that we had a little bit
more<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.110> heart<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:12.799> trades<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.220> area

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
more of a heart in the trades and area

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.340 
more of a heart in the trades and area
and<00:01:13.610> we<00:01:13.759> brought<00:01:13.940> showjumping<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.930> secretary

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and we brought showjumping a secretary

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.749 
and we brought showjumping a secretary
and<00:01:15.440> everything<00:01:15.740> together<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.399> give<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.640> bit

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.190 
and everything together to give it a bit
more<00:01:16.880> atmosphere<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.690> I<00:01:17.869> think<00:01:18.049> that's

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
more atmosphere and I think that's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.289 
more atmosphere and I think that's
worked<00:01:18.380> really<00:01:18.590> really<00:01:18.710> well<00:01:18.890> actually<00:01:19.299> we

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
but luckily I got a clear round so it's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.169 
but luckily I got a clear round so it's
really<00:02:05.539> pleased<00:02:05.810> with<00:02:05.989> that<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.090> what<00:02:08.090> I've

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
really pleased with that and what I've

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.969 
really pleased with that and what I've
heard<00:02:08.420> our<00:02:08.539> commentator<00:02:09.050> there's<00:02:09.590> been<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.739> few

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
heard our commentator there's been a few

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.160 
heard our commentator there's been a few
few<00:02:10.459> problems<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:10.940> course<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.510> yeah<00:02:12.140> I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
few problems on the course so yeah I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.390 
few problems on the course so yeah I

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
think it asks quite a lot of questions

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.670 
think it asks quite a lot of questions
and<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.790> was<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> good<00:02:14.480> mixture<00:02:14.720> offenses<00:02:15.290> I

and it was a good mixture offenses I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.460
