players<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> pc<00:01:05.040> i<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.580> much<00:01:05.700> larger

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
players on pc i think it's much larger

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.640 
players on pc i think it's much larger
than<00:01:06.150> news<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.600> console<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
than news on console and there's a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.080 
than news on console and there's a
couple<00:01:07.770> reasons<00:01:07.979> why<00:01:08.220> i<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
couple reasons why i think that one is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
couple reasons why i think that one is
because<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> controller<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
because of the controller there's so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
because of the controller there's so
much<00:01:11.010> there's<00:01:11.549> such<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.909> limited<00:01:12.299> amount<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
much there's such a limited amount of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
much there's such a limited amount of
movement<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.260> do<00:01:13.619> doesn't<00:01:14.340> matter<00:01:14.400> how

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
movement you can do doesn't matter how

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.120 
movement you can do doesn't matter how
how<00:01:15.270> good<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.049> you're<00:01:16.830> not
