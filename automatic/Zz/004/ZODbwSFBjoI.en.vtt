00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
time sort of to do those 30% things I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
time sort of to do those 30% things I
spent<00:01:53.610> probably<00:01:53.820> yeah<00:01:54.360> good<00:01:54.600> four<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.049> six

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
spent probably yeah good four to six

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
spent probably yeah good four to six
months<00:01:55.590> sort<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.189> doing<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> better<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.329> guess

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
months sort of doing a better I guess

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200 
months sort of doing a better I guess
prehab<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.320> also<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.979> guess<00:01:59.460> getting<00:01:59.790> some

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
prehab but also I guess getting some

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
prehab but also I guess getting some
weights<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.930> doing<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.409> lot<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> work<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.829> my

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
weights and doing a lot of work on my

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.319 
weights and doing a lot of work on my
kicking<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.399> thought<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> part<00:02:03.299> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
kicking I thought out that's a part of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.289 
kicking I thought out that's a part of
my<00:02:03.390> game<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.869> needed<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> work

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
my game that needed a bit of work

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.160 
my game that needed a bit of work
obviously<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> few<00:02:06.630> other<00:02:06.750> parts<00:02:06.960> as

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
obviously there's a few other parts as

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.940 
obviously there's a few other parts as
well<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.770> put<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> big

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
