00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:51.979 
this is actually once you get used to it
it's<00:02:42.900> quite<00:02:43.080> nice<00:02:46.820> though<00:02:47.820> yeah<00:02:50.660> ok<00:02:51.660> let's

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
it's quite nice though yeah ok let's

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.590 
it's quite nice though yeah ok let's
look<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.260> Reed's<00:02:52.730> pixels<00:02:53.730> pixels<00:02:54.209> pixels

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
look at Reed's pixels pixels pixels

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.400 
look at Reed's pixels pixels pixels
axles<00:02:55.110> everywhere<00:02:56.300> ok<00:02:57.300> one<00:02:58.019> thing<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
axles everywhere ok one thing that I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
axles everywhere ok one thing that I
noticed<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.830> didn't<00:02:59.070> change<00:02:59.250> was<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.700> mob

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
noticed you didn't change was the mob

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.720 
noticed you didn't change was the mob

spawner as a random observation leaves

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.000 
spawner as a random observation leaves
look<00:03:02.970> nice<00:03:03.150> let's<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.050> look<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.410> with

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.250 

fast<00:03:08.010> graphic<00:03:08.459> settings<00:03:11.930> ok<00:03:12.930> everything's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
fast graphic settings ok everything's

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.199 
fast graphic settings ok everything's
pretty<00:03:13.590> much<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.980> same<00:03:14.160> obviously<00:03:15.000> except

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
pretty much the same obviously except

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.479 
pretty much the same obviously except
for<00:03:15.360> leaves<00:03:15.540> which<00:03:15.750> are<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:15.989> blocking<00:03:16.489> so

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
for leaves which are now blocking so

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.400 
for leaves which are now blocking so
this<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.049> it's<00:03:19.049> not<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.320> bad<00:03:19.530> texture<00:03:20.010> pack<00:03:20.209> but

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
this is it's not a bad texture pack but

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.560 
this is it's not a bad texture pack but
you<00:03:22.410> tend<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.400> seem<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.730> lose<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> fair<00:03:24.390> bit<00:03:24.510> of

you tend you seem to lose a fair bit of
your<00:03:24.750> fair<00:03:25.440> bit<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:25.799> makes<00:03:25.980> minecraft

your fair bit of what makes minecraft

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.199 
your fair bit of what makes minecraft
minecraft<00:03:27.920> everything<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.280> terrifically

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
minecraft everything is terrifically

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.160 
minecraft everything is terrifically
blocky<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.260> lava<00:03:32.040> losses<00:03:32.519> at<00:03:32.700> all<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.170> okay

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
blocky and lava losses at all and okay

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.500 
blocky and lava losses at all and okay
that's<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.680> problem<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.910> don't<00:03:36.120> appear<00:03:36.450> to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
that's a problem you don't appear to

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.750 
that's a problem you don't appear to
have<00:03:36.750> any<00:03:36.959> textures<00:03:37.590> monitor<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.430> was<00:03:38.579> going<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
have any textures monitor I was going to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.830 
have any textures monitor I was going to
say<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:38.910> don't<00:03:39.000> have<00:03:39.150> textures<00:03:39.480> healing<00:03:39.750> on

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
say you don't have textures healing on

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.039 
say you don't have textures healing on
fire<00:03:40.049> but<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.620> which<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:40.980> good<00:03:41.810> ok<00:03:42.810> oh

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.720 

we've<00:03:46.049> jump<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.470> water<00:03:46.590> there<00:03:47.690> ok<00:03:48.690> so

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.550 

personally<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:53.970> not<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> fan<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.019> this<00:03:55.170> texture

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
personally I'm not a fan of this texture

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.770 
personally I'm not a fan of this texture
pack<00:03:55.739> but<00:03:56.130> that's<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:57.269> because<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.660> don't

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
pack but that's just because I don't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.140 
pack but that's just because I don't
change<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.769> many<00:03:58.920> pixels<00:03:59.370> or<00:03:59.610> this

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
change it like this many pixels or this

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.960 
change it like this many pixels or this
you<00:04:00.450> number<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:01.049> fee<00:04:01.230> number<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.530> pixels<00:04:01.970> but

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
you number this fee number of pixels but

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.360 
you number this fee number of pixels but
so<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.630> suppose<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.290> really<00:04:05.040> want<00:04:05.280> to

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
so I suppose if you really want to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.880 
so I suppose if you really want to
Pixley<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.120> more<00:04:06.420> Pixley<00:04:06.810> minecraft<00:04:07.260> than<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
Pixley a more Pixley minecraft than the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.680 
Pixley a more Pixley minecraft than the
default<00:04:08.070> texture<00:04:08.610> then<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.299> is<00:04:09.420> what<00:04:09.540> you're

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
default texture then this is what you're

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.370 
default texture then this is what you're
looking<00:04:09.720> for<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:11.100> we<00:04:11.280> look<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.640> world

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
looking for if we look in the world

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
looking for if we look in the world
pixels<00:04:13.380> pixels<00:04:13.829> everywhere<00:04:15.890> sand<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.190> things

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
pixels pixels everywhere sand and things

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.279 
pixels pixels everywhere sand and things
don't<00:04:17.609> tend<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.970> don't<00:04:18.479> look<00:04:18.630> very<00:04:18.660> good<00:04:18.930> in

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
don't tend to don't look very good in

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.900 
don't tend to don't look very good in
beaches<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.190> sort<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.459> thing<00:04:20.519> because

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
beaches and that sort of thing because

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.670 
beaches and that sort of thing because
of<00:04:21.030> course<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.390> have<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.720> uniform<00:04:22.080> border<00:04:22.380> so

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
of course you have the uniform border so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.630 
of course you have the uniform border so
blocks<00:04:23.460> don't<00:04:24.169> know<00:04:25.169> don't<00:04:25.979> blend<00:04:26.370> well

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
blocks don't know don't blend well

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.629 
blocks don't know don't blend well
together

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
together

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.379 
together
which<00:04:27.879> is<00:04:28.030> unfortunate<00:04:28.180> but<00:04:28.840> oh<00:04:29.080> well<00:04:30.389> so

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
which is unfortunate but oh well so

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.110 
which is unfortunate but oh well so
that's<00:04:31.749> basically<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:33.870> pixel<00:04:34.870> vac<00:04:36.120> pixels

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
that's basically the pixel vac pixels

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.860 
that's basically the pixel vac pixels
pixels<00:04:37.539> everywhere<00:04:38.129> and<00:04:39.129> of<00:04:39.969> course<00:04:40.210> now<00:04:40.719> with

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
pixels everywhere and of course now with
