here we go
so<00:00:14.120> alterations<00:00:15.370> they're<00:00:16.370> pretty<00:00:16.580> simple

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
so alterations they're pretty simple

when<00:00:21.170> we're<00:00:21.290> going<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.470> use<00:00:21.710> them<00:00:22.010> most<00:00:22.520> often

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
when we're going to use them most often

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.020 
when we're going to use them most often
in<00:00:23.360> jazz<00:00:23.720> so<00:00:24.020> we've<00:00:24.170> got<00:00:24.320> our<00:00:24.470> one<00:00:24.680> three<00:00:25.280> five

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
in jazz so we've got our one three five

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.560 
in jazz so we've got our one three five
and<00:00:27.070> flat<00:00:28.070> seven<00:00:28.640> I'm<00:00:28.850> going<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.030> use<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.270> f7

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
and flat seven I'm going to use the f7

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.440 
and flat seven I'm going to use the f7
to<00:00:29.780> start<00:00:30.020> off<00:00:30.170> with<00:00:31.090> one<00:00:32.090> three<00:00:32.480> five<00:00:34.450> just

to start off with one three five just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.560 
to start off with one three five just
throw<00:00:35.690> them<00:00:35.899> in<00:00:36.019> there<00:00:36.199> one<00:00:36.499> three<00:00:36.769> five<00:00:37.039> and

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
basically change something now when we

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.770 
basically change something now when we
looking<00:01:01.699> at<00:01:01.760> alterations<00:01:02.479> what<00:01:02.659> we're

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
looking at alterations what we're

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.530 
looking at alterations what we're
looking<00:01:03.050> at<00:01:03.170> is<00:01:03.530> we're<00:01:04.250> changing<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.710> nine<00:01:07.540> or

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
looking at is we're changing the nine or

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.950 
looking at is we're changing the nine or
the<00:01:09.530> five<00:01:10.000> that's<00:01:11.000> basically<00:01:11.509> what<00:01:11.810> we're

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
the five that's basically what we're

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440 
the five that's basically what we're
doing<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:13.430> majority<00:01:13.939> of<00:01:13.969> the<00:01:14.090> time<00:01:14.270> when

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
doing the majority of the time when

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.910 
doing the majority of the time when
we're<00:01:14.600> looking<00:01:14.840> at<00:01:14.930> alterations<00:01:15.590> there<00:01:15.770> are

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
we're looking at alterations there are

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.170 
we're looking at alterations there are
other<00:01:16.070> things<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.340> can<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:16.880> these<00:01:17.030> are

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
other things you can do but these are

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.149 
other things you can do but these are
the<00:01:17.240> basic<00:01:17.570> ones<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.380> you're<00:01:18.619> either<00:01:18.649> making

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
the basic ones so you're either making

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.950 
the basic ones so you're either making
the<00:01:19.490> nine<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:20.110> flat<00:01:21.110> nine<00:01:21.320> or<00:01:21.829> a<00:01:22.299> sharp<00:01:23.299> nine<00:01:23.570> and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
the nine a flat nine or a sharp nine and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.420 
the nine a flat nine or a sharp nine and
you're<00:01:24.110> making<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.710> fifth<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.610> flat<00:01:26.060> five<00:01:26.420> or

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
you're making the fifth a flat five or

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.490 
you're making the fifth a flat five or
sharp<00:01:28.430> five<00:01:28.820> or<00:01:29.149> some<00:01:29.420> combination<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:30.259> that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
sharp five or some combination of that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.450 
sharp five or some combination of that
so<00:01:31.159> if<00:01:31.219> we<00:01:31.399> have<00:01:31.640> our<00:01:32.560> we're<00:01:33.560> using<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:34.070> root

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
so if we have our we're using a root

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.020 
so if we have our we're using a root
position<00:01:34.609> there

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
position there

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.300 
position there
there's<00:01:37.240> f9<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:38.320> we<00:01:38.500> might<00:01:38.710> just<00:01:38.740> something

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
there's f9 and we might just something

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:49.740 
there's f9 and we might just something
like<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:40.860> okay<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:41.890> here<00:01:42.430> we've<00:01:42.610> got<00:01:48.750> nine

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
like this okay so here we've got nine

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.880 
like this okay so here we've got nine
flat<00:01:50.440> nine<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:52.210> sharp<00:01:52.480> five<00:01:55.620> that's<00:01:56.620> just

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
flat nine and a sharp five that's just

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.010 
flat nine and a sharp five that's just
in<00:01:57.190> root<00:01:57.880> position<00:01:57.910> now<00:01:58.390> when<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.690> change<00:01:58.930> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
in root position now when you change the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.640 
in root position now when you change the
voicings<00:01:59.650> and<00:01:59.830> things<00:02:00.310> like<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:01.470> it's<00:02:02.470> going

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
voicings and things like that it's going

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.730 
voicings and things like that it's going
to<00:02:02.710> sound<00:02:02.980> even<00:02:03.550> even<00:02:04.270> better<00:02:04.300> alright<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.440> um

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
to sound even even better alright so um

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.060 
to sound even even better alright so um
you<00:02:06.160> might<00:02:06.370> want<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.610> do<00:02:06.760> sharp<00:02:07.180> five<00:02:08.070> sharp

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
you might want to do sharp five sharp

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.699 
you might want to do sharp five sharp
nine<00:02:09.420> possibly<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.630> that's<00:02:10.929> already<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.350> sharp

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
nine possibly so that's already a sharp

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.160 
nine possibly so that's already a sharp
so<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.100> could<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.600> something<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:16.170> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
so we could do something like that and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.540 
so we could do something like that and
one<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> great<00:02:17.740> things<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.340> like

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
one of the great things that I like

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.420 
one of the great things that I like
doing<00:02:18.850> occasionally<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.780> playing<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.680> sharp

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
doing occasionally is playing the sharp

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.090 
doing occasionally is playing the sharp
nine<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.050> flat<00:02:23.290> nine<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.920> then

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
nine and then the flat nine and then

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.550 
nine and then the flat nine and then
kind<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.370> resolving<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.060> down<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.350> want

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
kind of resolving it down so you want

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.990 
kind of resolving it down so you want
just<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.800> nice<00:02:28.950> big<00:02:29.950> flat<00:02:30.280> chord<00:02:30.640> I'm<00:02:30.820> gonna

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
just a nice big flat chord I'm gonna

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.479 
just a nice big flat chord I'm gonna
resolve<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> airfryer

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.130 

okay<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:37.549> basically<00:02:37.870> alterations<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.989> we

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
okay so basically alterations is we
