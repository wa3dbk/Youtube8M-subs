table<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.670> edge<00:00:59.879> and<00:00:59.910> mask<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> whole

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
table on this edge and mask the whole

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
table on this edge and mask the whole
thing<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.949> shoot<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> jam

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
thing off and then just shoot that jam

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.670 
thing off and then just shoot that jam
