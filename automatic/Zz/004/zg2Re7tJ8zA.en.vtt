 authors that really the best 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.230
 advertising that can be done is what 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.850
 they give you your friends on the street or what 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.980
 you hear on the street, not about the

 Urban and I've heard 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.700
 a lot of homemade wisdom that is 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.290
 as a bible of how to be well and of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.750

 teacher thank you very much for being 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.850
 here for the year in the translations a 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.699
 little delegating 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.250
 let's start with homemade wisdom as 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.780
 they got 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.580
 what has been the impact that has had 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.810
 with all who have had the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.899
 opportunity to approach 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.689
 how it was conceived in the best way not 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.579
 planned I came to india in 2008 I 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.920
 I went to live there and I wrote it with 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.009
 my coauthor look author who is the one 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.030
 appears here 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.409
 I met him there in India without plans and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.470
 some way the state waiting 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.579
 find me to propose this and 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.479
 somehow I was looking for it 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.390
 unknowingly I proposed it and when I 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.759
 I proposed I said believe me I will do that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.740
 I reach the whole planet I do not know how but 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.950
 here is something very powerful is not only 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.700
 for me because because the thought 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:56.500
 linear was that I want to learn from you 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:58.539
 and the exact knowledge sounds like that 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.030
 it happens not but I said let's make a 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.680
 good karma 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.510
 something to share something for the world and 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.550
 when he saw that the intention had to 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.030
 see with something of darÃ­n or something to grab 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.909
 or not so much to receive but to give but to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.640
 through me 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.650
 it caught on the road and the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.659
 welcome was wonderful firm with 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.840
 one with a very large editorial of 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.879
 Spain came out first in Mexico was the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.450
 first country where it was published in February 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:34.140
 of 2011 and there started Argentina chile 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.720
 uruguay paraguay that now venezuela and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.540
 Colombia at the beginning of the year of the anime 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.489
 Spain and now comes out in rafa success 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.290
 this is an excess and it is well said 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:49.870
 This practical handbook along what 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.870
 leandro of what we could consider 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.030
 how to contribute to our physical health 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.400
 spiritual mental and all this kind of 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.200
 issues is a kind of manual and if 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 it is well said we are interpreting it 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.210
 another way what we do in show 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.400
 let's say in the western world kind 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.990
 they are especially coming out 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.110
 look for solutions outside the body 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.670
 outside in to see they believe that health has 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.110
 something to do with hospitals or with 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.820
 the doctors that with the industry 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.740
 pharmaceutical medicines and all 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.200
 medicines maybe all that in a stria 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.750
 of the disease and not in the industry of 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.490
 health health what we explain there 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.140
 is that it is based on five activities that 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.410
 we do every day the way we 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.870
 we breathe the way we move 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.420
 the way we feed ourselves and with 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.460
 that the way we sleep and the way 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.380
 in what we think from these five 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.220
 cities as fundamental activities 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.620
 of icea 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.210
 I do not say it I say it in writing 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.430
 sacred life has for several 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.020
 not always told me that his teacher as 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.330
 grabbed a hand made a 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.220
 translation of all those ancestors 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.440
 because the truth right now everything 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.780
 we have very practical within reach of the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.030
 hand not before I still remember 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.710
 even my 8 year old son who 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.420
 before I did not believe that popcorn 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.160
 we made them in a pot and the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.750
 we had to move minds to a 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.670
 well very convenient microwave you already have 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.280
 your popcorn not here are you 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.110
 giving basic tools of our 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.320
 ancestors that we can still 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.470
 to pick up and that many times as you say no 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.000
 There is a need for an analgesic 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.880
 encapsulated is the solution for my 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.510
 stress problems do not but because it is 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.100
 very crazy and assign it outside and maybe 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.140
 we are not seeing what is behind 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.330
 example has just been an analgesic the 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.390
 Paracetamol 500 saw I will not say 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.880
 no brand but the drug that is taken 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.770
 for for the fever when the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.450
 fever and that is the fever the fever is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.520
 that the temperature of your body rises 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.100
 to burn toxins because it's 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.830
 intoxicated because through the means 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.770
 classic to remove reaches me back from the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.470
 sweat 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:59.620
 the snot or kaka then the body like 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.629
 response mechanism to this very wise 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.699
 there is a very big intelligence work 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.930
 we of our body raise the 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.460
 temperature to take the toxins 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.220
 we take the step of taking 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.830
 500 we lower the temperature we eat 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.900
 all the toxins look at killock or things 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.610
 as basic as what I just said and 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.860
 we do not know and this comes here then 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.050
 there what we say is from these 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.819
 five activities morning habits 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.729
 habit of night energy vital energy 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:27.880
 negative the mind the doubts the stress the 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.979
 depression the death of birth are 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.030
 chapters that to know many thematic 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.030
 of our life 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.100
 separated and apart the other book more 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.349
 deeper inside 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.210
 and if I do it makes me a little more daring 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.139
 here 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.539
 as I get a little more in front of the 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.280
 moral habits, customs and all 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.800
 the things that are verifying when being 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.930
 human this is about when I talk about 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.699
 holy devil I speak of us I say of 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.470
 us to see if we went 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.780
 made by the same milk that they made 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.330
 to the universe knowing us 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.580
 we know the universe then the idea 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.380
 of this is to know not only our light 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.580
 also our darkness work 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.699
 double with oneself game 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.620
 and there it gets a bit rough is to stop 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.990
 not be to start doing stop not 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.939
 to be to place that would be the majority 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.889
 of people will immediately run to 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.500
 the bookstores because this is like going to 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.710
 he to the cinema is much better you stay 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.599
 with an embodied wisdom and I think it is 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.819
 to have it at home so that 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.289
 regales so you simply say here 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.030
 is here is the balance not 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.650
 Many thanks to luck have 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.599
 alleged to be with their in programs 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.080
