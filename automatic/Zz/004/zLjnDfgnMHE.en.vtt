00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you have when you play a game like for

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.849 
you have when you play a game like for
example<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.220> something<00:00:27.859> if

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
example and I'm going for something if

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
example and I'm going for something if
it's<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.220> my<00:00:29.369> initial<00:00:29.730> try<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:30.090> say<00:00:30.480> it's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it's like my initial try like say it's

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
it's like my initial try like say it's
like<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.560> most<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> guys<00:00:32.040> don't<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.460> is

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
like what most you guys don't know is

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
like what most you guys don't know is
that<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.570> i<00:00:33.630> don't<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> nuke<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.320> the

that if i don't get the nuke on the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
that if i don't get the nuke on the
first<00:00:34.620> try<00:00:35.030> it's<00:00:36.030> probably<00:00:36.239> unlike<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> 20th

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
first try it's probably unlike the 20th
um<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:38.969> actuality<00:00:39.149> i'd<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
yourself to see the difficulty of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
yourself to see the difficulty of
getting<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.850> gun<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.960> game<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> played

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
getting the gun so in this game I played

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
getting the gun so in this game I played
a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:46.950> conservative<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> yes<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
a little more conservative and yes be it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
a little more conservative and yes be it
that<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.530> three<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> seven

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that I do get I think three of the seven

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
that I do get I think three of the seven
kills<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> Harrier<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> gun<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
kills with the Harrier with the gun and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.779 
kills with the Harrier with the gun and
then<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> play<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.280> smart<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
then I play really really smart at the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.040 
then I play really really smart at the
end<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> pick<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> last<00:00:54.539> three<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
end to pick up the last three with the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
end to pick up the last three with the
gun<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.440> i<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.620> i<00:00:55.800> only<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> total

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
gun so i think i only get like a total

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.069 
gun so i think i only get like a total
of<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.000> eight<00:00:57.210> kills<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> gun<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of like eight kills with the gun so a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
of like eight kills with the gun so a
lot<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> people<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.649> probably<00:00:58.770> troll<00:00:59.129> on

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lot of people would probably troll on

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.639 
lot of people would probably troll on
that<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> map<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that but on a map like this what can you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740 
that but on a map like this what can you
do<00:01:01.829> i<00:01:01.859> honestly<00:01:02.640> use<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:03.000> sim<00:01:03.210> texts<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> my
