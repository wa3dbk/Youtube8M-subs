00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
of the detector this is being brought

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.639 
of the detector this is being brought
near<00:00:44.960> now<00:00:47.170> what<00:00:48.170> we<00:00:48.500> have<00:00:48.739> measured<00:00:49.370> here<00:00:49.640> is

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
near now what we have measured here is

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.910 
near now what we have measured here is
40<00:00:51.649> mm<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.220> sensitivity<00:00:53.200> that<00:00:54.200> means<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.739> if

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
40 mm of sensitivity that means you if

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.100 
40 mm of sensitivity that means you if
you<00:00:55.070> have<00:00:55.309> object<00:00:55.910> 2<00:00:56.210> mm<00:00:56.450> away<00:00:56.570> from<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
you have object 2 mm away from the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.959 
you have object 2 mm away from the
detector<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.680> will<00:00:57.800> be<00:00:57.950> able<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.340> detect<00:00:58.610> now

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
detector it will be able to detect now

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.209 
detector it will be able to detect now
we<00:00:59.030> will<00:00:59.270> move<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.690> next<00:00:59.870> detector<00:01:00.440> which

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
we will move to the next detector which

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.079 
we will move to the next detector which
is<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.460> triple<00:01:02.270> 9c<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.860> one<00:01:04.100> first<00:01:04.640> used<00:01:04.879> is

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
is a triple 9c the one first used is

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.640 
is a triple 9c the one first used is
switched<00:01:05.330> off<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.110> other<00:01:06.260> one<00:01:06.530> is

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
switched off and the other one is

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.870 
switched off and the other one is
switched<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:07.070> now<00:01:07.540> now<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.600> check<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
switched on now now we check the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.930 
switched on now now we check the
sensitivity<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:11.170> triple<00:01:12.170> 9c<00:01:12.650> which<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.670> quite

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
sensitivity of triple 9c which is quite

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.390 
sensitivity of triple 9c which is quite
sensitive<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.170> applicable<00:01:15.619> for<00:01:16.100> Indian

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
sensitive and applicable for Indian

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.600 
sensitive and applicable for Indian
conditions<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.690> that<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.080> can<00:01:18.409> sense<00:01:18.890> people

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
conditions so that you can sense people

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.570 
conditions so that you can sense people
from<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.880> little<00:01:20.330> distance<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:22.460> is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
from a little distance now this is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.800 
from a little distance now this is
giving<00:01:22.880> your<00:01:23.000> sensitivity<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.810> almost<00:01:24.350> 10

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
giving your sensitivity of almost 10

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.070 
giving your sensitivity of almost 10
centimetres<00:01:26.920> 100<00:01:27.920> mm<00:01:28.210> now<00:01:29.210> we<00:01:29.240> move<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
centimetres 100 mm now we move on to the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.170 
centimetres 100 mm now we move on to the
third<00:01:30.350> super<00:01:30.950> scanner<00:01:33.640> we<00:01:34.640> will<00:01:34.790> check<00:01:35.030> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
third super scanner we will check the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.789 
third super scanner we will check the
sensitivity<00:01:35.720> of<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.350> switched<00:01:36.619> on

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
sensitivity of this this is switched on

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.359 
sensitivity of this this is switched on
now<00:01:37.299> now<00:01:38.299> we<00:01:38.360> move<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:38.780> scale<00:01:39.260> up<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.159> down

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
now now we move this scale up and down

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.539 
now now we move this scale up and down
but<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:40.790> not<00:01:40.909> being<00:01:41.810> able<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:42.049> detect<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
but it's not being able to detect it the

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.469 
but it's not being able to detect it the
coin<00:01:43.729> is<00:01:43.909> brought<00:01:44.180> down<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:46.340> has<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.700> go

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
coin is brought down and it has to go

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.630 
coin is brought down and it has to go
down<00:01:47.659> yet<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:48.920> please<00:01:49.130> check<00:01:49.310> once

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
down yet and can you please check once

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.719 
down yet and can you please check once
again<00:01:52.150> no<00:01:53.150> this<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.479> working<00:01:54.549> perfectly<00:01:55.549> at<00:01:57.729> 40

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
again no this is working perfectly at 40

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.620 
again no this is working perfectly at 40
mm<00:01:59.210> again<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.700> weapon<00:02:02.030> scan<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
mm again so this and the weapon scan the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.920 
mm again so this and the weapon scan the
first<00:02:02.900> one<00:02:03.079> scanned<00:02:03.470> for<00:02:04.070> giving<00:02:04.460> similar

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
first one scanned for giving similar

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.260 
first one scanned for giving similar
