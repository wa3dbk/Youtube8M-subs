00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and give us sort of a base and work from

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
and give us sort of a base and work from
there<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> guys<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.590> two<00:01:28.740> seconds

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
there see you guys think in two seconds

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
there see you guys think in two seconds
what<00:01:29.520> we're<00:01:29.640> gonna<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.329> start<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.659> by

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
what we're gonna do now is start off by

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.749 
what we're gonna do now is start off by
opening<00:01:31.229> 10<00:01:31.470> packs<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.310> base<00:01:32.490> for

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
opening 10 packs that is a good base for

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
opening 10 packs that is a good base for
our<00:01:33.210> team<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> work<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.110> there

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
our team and then we can work from there

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
our team and then we can work from there
so<00:01:34.680> let's<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> first<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.180> have

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so let's go into the first one we have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.050 
so let's go into the first one we have
Leonardo<00:01:36.570> Messi<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> front<00:01:37.770> whoa<00:01:38.340> will<00:01:38.970> we

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
Leonardo Messi on the front whoa will we

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
Leonardo Messi on the front whoa will we
get<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.390> solid<00:01:39.570> defense<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.229> did<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.470> packs

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
get a solid defense like we did in packs

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.020 
get a solid defense like we did in packs
power<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> key<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.880> get

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
power I think that was the key if we get

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.429 
power I think that was the key if we get
a<00:01:42.060> sort<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.270> defense<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> work<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.200> from

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
a sort of defense we can work up from

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.600 
a sort of defense we can work up from
that<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.310> go

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that so here we go

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.010 
that so here we go
the<00:01:44.759> first<00:01:45.000> pack<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.570> gonna<00:01:45.689> skip<00:01:45.990> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
get decent and right back I guess and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.920 
get decent and right back I guess and
the<00:02:26.520> rest<00:02:26.760> what<00:02:26.940> we<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.510> store<00:02:27.780> into

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the rest what we will do is store into

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.449 
the rest what we will do is store into
the<00:02:28.020> club<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> move<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> third<00:02:29.280> one

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the club and move on to the third one

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.970 
the club and move on to the third one
and<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.700> also<00:02:29.880> think<00:02:30.239> being<00:02:30.420> 10<00:02:30.810> episodes<00:02:31.739> long

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and I also think being 10 episodes long

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.590 
and I also think being 10 episodes long
we're<00:02:32.130> gonna<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.430> two<00:02:32.580> games<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.120> each<00:02:33.300> I

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
we're gonna have two games in each I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.000 
we're gonna have two games in each I
think<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.560> make<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.860> little

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
think that a little make it a little

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.260 
think that a little make it a little
fresher<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.489> know<00:02:35.610> more<00:02:35.880> packs<00:02:36.090> will<00:02:36.239> be

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
fresher you know more packs will be

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.880 
fresher you know more packs will be
opened<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.410> start<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.680> series

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
opened and then we can start the series

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.040 
opened and then we can start the series
again<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.520> that's<00:02:38.910> probably<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.690> bit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
again because that's probably the bit

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.510 
again because that's probably the bit
that<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.230> actually<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.680> prefer<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:41.340> this

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
that I actually do prefer with this

sure we get McElroy Gore rule Albion and
also<00:03:41.640> Zuniga<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.359> that's<00:03:42.600> not<00:03:42.840> best<00:03:43.290> quality

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
also Zuniga so that's not best quality

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.099 
also Zuniga so that's not best quality
actually<00:03:43.859> we<00:03:44.130> get<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> couple<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:45.109> Napoli

players<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.560> we<00:03:46.620> could<00:03:46.799> probably<00:03:47.100> link<00:03:47.700> up

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
players that we could probably link up

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.729 
players that we could probably link up
for<00:03:47.880> somehow<00:03:48.359> for<00:03:48.900> another<00:03:49.140> City<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.440> player

a 3-5-2 formation this is probably
it's<00:06:35.650> chemistry<00:06:35.830> that<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:36.310> could<00:06:36.640> have<00:06:36.730> got<00:06:36.910> out

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
it's chemistry that I could have got out

was a cracking pool partnered him up
with<00:06:46.690> as<00:06:46.900> a<00:06:47.050> letter<00:06:47.350> playing<00:06:47.890> out<00:06:48.070> of<00:06:48.100> position

and we have this silver guy that I

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.900 
and we have this silver guy that I
thought<00:07:02.650> I'd<00:07:02.800> bring<00:07:02.920> him<00:07:03.100> in<00:07:03.220> his<00:07:03.460> name<00:07:03.670> is

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
thought I'd bring him in his name is

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.840

Michael<00:07:04.300> E<00:07:04.390> a<00:07:04.420> co<00:07:04.950> decent<00:07:05.950> stats<00:07:06.130> on<00:07:06.310> him<00:07:06.400> 74

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
Michael E a co decent stats on him 74

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.970 
Michael E a co decent stats on him 74
defense<00:07:07.120> 84<00:07:07.690> heading<00:07:08.050> for<00:07:08.290> a<00:07:08.320> silver<00:07:08.650> plan<00:07:08.830> I

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980 
defense 84 heading for a silver plan I

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.520 
defense 84 heading for a silver plan I
think<00:07:09.040> 65<00:07:09.670> pace<00:07:09.880> is<00:07:10.060> perfect<00:07:10.510> for<00:07:10.960> a<00:07:10.990> left

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
think 65 pace is perfect for a left

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.140 
think 65 pace is perfect for a left
defensive<00:07:11.890> mid<00:07:12.070> and<00:07:12.280> obviously<00:07:12.790> it<00:07:12.970> was<00:07:13.060> when

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
defensive mid and obviously it was when

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.330 
defensive mid and obviously it was when
