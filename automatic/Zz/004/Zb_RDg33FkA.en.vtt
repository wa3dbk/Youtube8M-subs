274 Ottawa yeah you know you'd expect
that<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> home<00:01:40.650> team<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that from the home team I think the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
that from the home team I think the
first<00:01:42.030> half<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.200> well<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.770> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
first half we did very very well up I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
first half we did very very well up I
think<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> second<00:01:44.880> half<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.299> sort<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> ran<00:01:45.630> out

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
think the second half we sort of ran out

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.330 
think the second half we sort of ran out
a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.079> bit<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> gas<00:01:46.500> maybe<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.159> that's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
a little bit of gas maybe and that's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
a little bit of gas maybe and that's
where<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:48.210> their<00:01:48.420> shots<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.930> heads<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.259> goal

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
where got their shots and heads on goal

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.830 
where got their shots and heads on goal
but<00:01:49.680> overall<00:01:50.399> from<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> real<00:01:51.420> hook<00:01:51.630> step

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
but overall from from a real hook step

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740 
but overall from from a real hook step
standpoint<00:01:52.560> being<00:01:53.340> able<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.909> 31<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.570> at
