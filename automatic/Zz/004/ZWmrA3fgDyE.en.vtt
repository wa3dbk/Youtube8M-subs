00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
doesn't do much and I fair dance and
this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> great<00:00:48.570> move<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.050> pidgeotto<00:00:49.710> because

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this is great move on pidgeotto because

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.510 
this is great move on pidgeotto because
it<00:00:50.520> cannot<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.180> walled<00:00:51.570> by<00:00:51.930> rock<00:00:52.800> types<00:00:53.190> or

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it cannot be walled by rock types or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
it cannot be walled by rock types or
steel<00:00:54.510> types<00:00:54.780> too<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.559> fair<00:00:56.250> dance

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
steel types too much because fair dance

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.270 
steel types too much because fair dance
will<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:57.059> their<00:00:57.420> attacks<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.530> low<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
will make their attacks very low and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.330 
will make their attacks very low and
yeah<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.410> were<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.859> much<00:01:02.039> become

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
yeah so they were pretty much become

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.929 
yeah so they were pretty much become
useless<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.680> because<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> yeah<00:01:05.339> yeah

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
useless and because of that yeah yeah

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.620 
useless and because of that yeah yeah
this<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> great<00:01:06.840> combo<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.390> as<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> see

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
this is a great combo and as you can see

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.109 
this is a great combo and as you can see
his<00:01:09.930> toxic<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.520> burned<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
his toxic now and I'm kind of burned and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
his toxic now and I'm kind of burned and
he<00:01:12.360> may<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.540> predicting<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.500> boost

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
he may be predicting I don't have boost

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.030 
he may be predicting I don't have boost
but<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> I

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
he gets a crate from that jab can so he

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.660 
he gets a crate from that jab can so he
kind<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.379> predicts<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:36.220> move<00:03:36.430> coming

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
kind of predicts this move coming

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.539 
kind of predicts this move coming
the<00:03:36.970> hissing<00:03:37.480> toxic<00:03:37.689> so<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.170> can<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:38.920> air<00:03:39.250> /

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
the hissing toxic so I can this air /

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.780 
the hissing toxic so I can this air /
does<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> lot<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.260> dusclops<00:03:41.260> because<00:03:41.829> this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
does a lot to the dusclops because this

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.630 
does a lot to the dusclops because this
thing<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.180> take<00:03:43.360> every<00:03:43.930> attack<00:03:44.200> really<00:03:44.640> that

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
thing can take every attack really that

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.069 
thing can take every attack really that
does<00:03:45.849> stand<00:03:46.150> or<00:03:46.269> damaged<00:03:46.569> her<00:03:46.720> pretty<00:03:46.989> well

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
does stand or damaged her pretty well

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.920 
does stand or damaged her pretty well
but<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:48.220> kind<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.519> dyes<00:03:48.670> from<00:03:48.849> Angela<00:03:49.299> Ursula

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
but it kind of dyes from Angela Ursula

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.000 
but it kind of dyes from Angela Ursula
so<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.260> thing<00:03:50.470> must<00:03:50.920> be<00:03:51.040> minimum<00:03:52.000> HP<00:03:52.629> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
so that thing must be minimum HP and

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.559 
so that thing must be minimum HP and
maybe<00:03:54.010> max<00:03:54.959> special<00:03:55.959> maybe<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:57.209> ball<00:03:58.209> yeah

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
maybe max special maybe a ball yeah

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.020 
maybe max special maybe a ball yeah
physical<00:03:59.140> wall<00:03:59.620> but<00:04:00.299> we<00:04:01.299> will<00:04:01.540> not<00:04:01.690> know<00:04:01.750> yeah
