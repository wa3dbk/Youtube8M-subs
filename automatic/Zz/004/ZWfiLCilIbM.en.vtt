00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
was getting more feedback from my body

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.039 
was getting more feedback from my body
running<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.880> these<00:03:27.000> yeah<00:03:27.510> compared<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
running in these yeah compared to the

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.990 
running in these yeah compared to the
fiber<00:03:28.230> rooms<00:03:28.470> definitely<00:03:29.340> yeah<00:03:29.489> definitely

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
fiber rooms definitely yeah definitely

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.170 
fiber rooms definitely yeah definitely
yes<00:03:30.420> more<00:03:30.660> more<00:03:31.049> barefoot<00:03:31.260> yeah<00:03:31.980> totally<00:03:32.670> yeah

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
yes more more barefoot yeah totally yeah

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.180 
yes more more barefoot yeah totally yeah
totally<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> think<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:34.500> fair<00:03:34.920> foods

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
totally so I think it's like fair foods

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.640 
totally so I think it's like fair foods
and<00:03:35.370> then<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.610> next<00:03:35.880> thing<00:03:36.470> you've<00:03:37.470> got

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and then the next thing you've got

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.610 
and then the next thing you've got
vibrance

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
vibrance

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.699 
vibrance
minimalist<00:03:40.620> shoes<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:42.569> terms<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.590> need

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
minimalist shoes so in terms of we need

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.280 
minimalist shoes so in terms of we need
to<00:03:43.770> experiment<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.490> bit<00:03:44.520> with<00:03:44.670> laces<00:03:45.240> yeah<00:03:45.720> so

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
to experiment a bit with laces yeah so

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.320 
to experiment a bit with laces yeah so
this<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.590> something<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.130> find<00:03:47.430> like<00:03:47.730> mom

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
this is something that I find like mom

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.580 
this is something that I find like mom
is<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.510> little<00:03:48.690> bit<00:03:48.780> loose<00:03:48.990> as<00:03:49.200> well<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.380> think

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
is a little bit loose as well I think

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.559 
is a little bit loose as well I think
yours<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:49.950> as<00:03:50.069> well<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.730> was<00:03:51.180> feeling<00:03:51.300> around

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
yours is as well so I was feeling around

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.780 
yours is as well so I was feeling around
trying<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.900> turn<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.350> little<00:03:52.500> bit<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:53.130> the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
trying to turn it up a little bit on the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.449 
trying to turn it up a little bit on the
on<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.150> front<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:55.530> improved<00:03:55.950> definitely

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
on the front and it improved definitely

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.160 
on the front and it improved definitely
but<00:03:56.910> I've<00:03:57.000> also<00:03:57.150> noticed<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.690> probably<00:03:57.900> need<00:03:58.080> to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
but I've also noticed I probably need to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.010 
but I've also noticed I probably need to
trim<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.709> bit<00:03:59.250> more<00:03:59.459> rubber<00:04:00.209> around<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> sole

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
trim a bit more rubber around the sole

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.930 
trim a bit more rubber around the sole
here<00:04:01.200> around<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.440> front<00:04:01.709> around<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> side<00:04:02.640> so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
here around the front around the side so

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.729 
here around the front around the side so
I<00:04:03.150> think<00:04:03.390> probably<00:04:03.720> what's<00:04:04.050> best<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.590> wear

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
I think probably what's best is to wear

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.680 
I think probably what's best is to wear
them<00:04:04.920> for<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.069> little<00:04:05.190> bit<00:04:05.430> get<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> right<00:04:06.390> fit

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
them for a little bit get the right fit

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.780 
them for a little bit get the right fit
so<00:04:06.930> they're<00:04:07.080> not<00:04:07.170> too<00:04:07.830> loose<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.310> tight<00:04:08.340> get

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
so they're not too loose to tight get

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.280 
so they're not too loose to tight get
comfortable<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.270> them<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.569> then<00:04:09.870> perhaps<00:04:10.110> do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
comfortable in them and then perhaps do

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.110 
comfortable in them and then perhaps do
a<00:04:10.500> little<00:04:10.830> bit<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.010> trimming<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.519> perhaps

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
a little bit of trimming as I perhaps

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.470 
a little bit of trimming as I perhaps
will<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.570> mine<00:04:12.780> yeah<00:04:13.170> yeah<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.860> just<00:04:14.190> just

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
will do mine yeah yeah so just just just

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.509 
will do mine yeah yeah so just just just
