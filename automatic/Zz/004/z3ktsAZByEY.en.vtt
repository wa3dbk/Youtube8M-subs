00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.880
 [Music] 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 this 77 year old patient has the arteries 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.759
 bites 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 he has already been operated on the heart for this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.590
 reason in this intervention 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.439
 the artery that will be treated and the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.560
 carotid the narrowing of this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.150
 carotid is very important because 80% of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.080
 inner diameter of the artery is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:34.230
 carotid primary carotid clog 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.450
 external and internal carotid like this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 artery is the main source of meaning 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 for the brain it must be marketed 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
 preventively to avoid what we 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.570
 call the attack ie a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.350
 paralysis and restore circulation 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 blood level in the brain on this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 dangerous image to the scanner which is a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.809
 scanner with opacification of the vessels 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 blood 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 we can see the calcifications that are 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 these irregular shapes and that closes the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.969
 light inside the ship like 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.690
 dutartre inside a 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.840
 piping 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.510
 this is a common intervention on 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.439
 main risk of this operation 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 comes from the fact that the circulation 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.189
 blood level in the brain must be 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.590
 interrupted during the intervention 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 which requires monitoring if the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.700
 brain does not suffer by a 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.310
 electroencephalogram but the real 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 danger would be not to operate this 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 patient who would then have great 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.540
 chances of suffering a full- page attack 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.759
 external the artery and clamp it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 means that a clip is placed on the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.350
 vessel and block the circulation of the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 blood to the brain that the cut of the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.680
 wall of the artery is difficult because 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.799
 side but a hard plate such as 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.600
 pebble and very adherent to the parish 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.729
 it is necessary very gently to take off the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.770
 plate of the vessel wall for 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.820
 able to extract it and allow 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.009
 new in the sense of good circulation 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 here is the plate extracted from the inside 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.750
 of the ship it is easy to understand 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.710
 view how much blood flow 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.319
 was diminished inside the ship 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 the carotid was cleaned inside 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.290
 we see that now she is 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.870
 completely smooth and she found 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 his initial caliber a small prosthesis 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.420
 polyester knit and coated with a 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.819
 anticoagulant substance will be used 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.209
 to suture the artery without reducing the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.510
 caliber and here you are 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.209
 the internal carotid artery closed with 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.060
 the patch that serves as patches so as not to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.640
 not reduce its diameter and skin 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.090
 future and with insurgents that allows for 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.560
 limit the postoperative scar the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.410
 plastic pipe coming out of the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.260
 scar and a drain it helps to 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.360
 monitor that the carotid does not bleed 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.489
 it will be removed within 24 to 48 hours 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.650
 who follow the intervention is the son 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.459
 suture is completely resorbed 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.070
 after about a month 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:04.790
 leaving only a very slight 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:07.220
 scar at the level of the skin the purpose of 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.410
 this invention is to lead the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.959
 carotid there are two carotid ones these are the 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.420
 main axes of vascularization of the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.190
 brain exams that pass this 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.160
 patient especially the doppler that is 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.440
 the key exam confirmed by what we 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.890
 call the angel to the scanner confirmed 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.260
 this stenosis so we are going to lead 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.690
 carotid in order to give back a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.810
 normal blood supply to the brain is 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.920
 a prevention intervention for 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.530
 avoid what is called the tax is at 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.510
 say paralysis paralysis of the emi 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.510
 body of an arm or loss of 1 hour 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.570
 [Music] 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.579
 it's an invention that is not 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.590
 painful it consists of a 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.510
 incision in the neck that heals 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.600
 very well and that disappears in general 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.720
 totally in a month to 2 months and but 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.670
 which is not painful the risks of 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.380
 this type of surgery on our 2 gold is 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.390
 a lot bleeding risk 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.459
 but it is exceptional and the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.840
 surgeon does everything so that there is 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.419
 not this hemorrhage it is then 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.950
 monitor in intensive care for 24 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.360
 hours and the second laugh and that 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.910
 the brain is suffering during 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.620
 the intervention is why during 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.980
 this intervention we are watching the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.530
 brain by the electroencephalogram in 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.570
 the main risk is not to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.070
 not know that it has that is not 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.370
 not do this intervention 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.330
 so I repeat it is necessary to do doppler 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.130
 systematic 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:44.670
 when he has a lower risk factor 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:47.430
 diabetes mellitus this intervention lasts 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.260
 between 2 to 3 hours and depends 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.950
 also of the type of anesthesia the type 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.280
 of anesthetized 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.050
 he may be under a local epidural 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.410
 that is, simply to sleep the area 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:05.100
 small blow to comfort for the patient 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:07.350
 or then a general anesthesia the 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.590
 duration of hospitalization and 2 surroundings 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.090
 from 3 to 4 days with usually one day 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.460
 in intensive care 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:21.690
 postoperative and the average duration 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:23.400
 stop working and 15 days it 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.590
 will have to resume the treatment that had 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.380
 been instituted previously is also 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.970
 antiplatelet platelet treatment 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.980
 which can be in different forms 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.930
 but the purpose of this treatment is 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.930
 to avoid platelet aggregation 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.760
 [Music] 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.100
 after an intervention like this the 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.080
 patient is in the chair the next day and 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.850
 can walk again after 48 hours 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.060
 leave the hospital after three 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:57.650
 days the sport can be picked up after 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.650
 from 15 days to three weeks 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.940
 [Music] 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.860
 then he will ensure palin surveillance 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.780
 because most of the time it's about 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.750
 patients polite vascular in the frame 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.000
 of a smoking arteritis or diabetic 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.220
 and so that's included as part of 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.010
 their general supervision with 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.800
 especially doppler repeat to see 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.410
 if there is no re steno ie 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.240
 that the steno breeds what is 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.919
 rare 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.680
 there are no other locations 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.560
 of arterial disease and of course 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.660
 all this requires the stopping of the factors 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.930
 risk and, above all, taxation 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.930
 Smoking that is essential
