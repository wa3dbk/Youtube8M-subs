00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.480
 there everyone would ask 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.660
 today we find ourselves for a tutorial 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.570
 to finally have rather ac to have 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:28.230
 the zombies mode and on moratorium so 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.199
 jimmy this morning i put a tutorial for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.030
 like in mode and part of it so 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.300
 I will put you the link of the tutorial in the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.800
 description because we have to end 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 to business this little tutorial with the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.719
 saved game mode and who is in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 the description too 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.289
 So as you get here if you 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.940
 put your saved game in the key 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370
 usb you take it or if you have it 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 overtaking a hard drive you take the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 hard drive so me is on the map 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.690
 but here's the score 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.980
 shredded so I was doing it because you're 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.870
 well our holidays according to resume 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.729
 normally if everything is fine 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 will have art appear in the sense of 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.840
 streams so that worked out well 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.840
 Well, you'll see what I want to do 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.820
 so it works well of course the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
 hac you can fashion and zombies in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.330
 line or partly private will have this word 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.250
 where there I am in the lake 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.799
 finally in the creek and press 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 start and you see he scored less than 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.740
 points and you have a viewfinder 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.010
 it's your angle so you have that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010
 can 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.310
 so here you go in Nazi zombies 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.679
 xbox live and that's so if you want 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630
 to have how it blinks you mate 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.689
 marked me with reindeer 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.280
 r yen in uppercase in your back the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.219

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:08.049
 line so here if panties or not 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.310
 the other one it still works badly 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.019
 you can infected ones too 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.620
 normally it works if you 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.110
 infected not to kill the month of it's 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.190
 as partly under water times then on 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:29.239
 start it's going to kill party month 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:31.670
 there you are rennais it works on 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.980

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.060

 albert this is the patient and merguez 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.819
 so you can exclude players 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.810
 you can m 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.900
 you can do a lot of things 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.690
 so you see your lot to exclude 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.760
 players like lime lot 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.380
 cartoon to cartoon like where 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.959

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.580
 accelerate and there has slowed down 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.130
