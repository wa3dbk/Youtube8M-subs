00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.450
 so all the live and videos 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:08.160
 welcome to this video tutorial that what 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.900
 just and remark registered from -1 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.219
 in this opportunity that I am going to show you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.970
 to see how to set up the shadow coaster 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.220
 in regards to audio and audio 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.960
 of the microphone 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 first let's start with the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 microphone we have the window of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.160
 microphones and it appears to us as well as what 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.770
 I have me here because certainly the sam 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.180
 brooke caster is configured according to 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 your criteria or how you sell the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.620
 default program that does not matter 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.449
 much ok I'm going josep effects 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.050
 if it was on you give it 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.390
 again so it's not green 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.110
 configuration here is simple already 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.020
 it should be configured 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.630
 the microphone 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.030
 I in my case have a device of a 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.489
 two 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.010
 for the micro forum but you are going to 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.780
 have for example primary controller 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.780
 capture audio video 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.080
 and to open the mixer is to give 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.780
 volume to the microphone or anything 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.330
 I'm using windows xp or that you 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.880
 open the mixer if you do not see these 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.430
 advanced here is because certainly 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.320
 it is so for example if it comes out like this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.260
 you are going to options 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.600
 notice that the microphone is marked 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.610
 options against advanced controls 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.980
 remember windows xp in advanced 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.060
 I give it an increase 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.570
 the microphone gain plus 20 debut ok 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.980
 and I give it to close there I have the maximum 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.980
 microphone volume 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.730
 and then I go to equalizer 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.520
 and this I locate in boys effects s 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.129
 Notice how I have it here you 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.269
 all this parameter that all these 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.269
 parameters that you see here 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.520
 and you are going to have it to take for 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.250
 set the microphone ok so that the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.670
 microphone come out a little bit above 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.720
 normal or have more volume per 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.310
 that expands the stereo and applies the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.800
 agent so that it does not saturate liquidates the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.360
 box 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.320
 and so too 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.640
 galvanic for being the processor of two 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.000
 sides 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.670
 according to gates 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.380
 can they give you or what 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.290
 I do not tell you that first we go to the text and 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.280
 we tighten bypass 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.910
 and the takeoff buyvip to the box to the fart 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.319
 and in mixer they will configure it 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.470
 exactly as I have it here 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.780
 take away the equalizer waltz 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.030
 they mark the one the stereo answers 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.700
 I think the are activated and the world 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.200
 down teacher or double processor 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.630
 band will activate the 5-tone van 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.360
 because we are going to work with two bands 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.110
 stereo 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.480
 once all that is ok and should 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:44.480
 leave the microphone very loud as 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.230
 you can see that it moves and strong 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.710
 when folding and passing what 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.010
 is the part a little red that's not 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.380
 it means that it is saturating but if 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.870
 in future case you can 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.140
 download here you can lower the microphone 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.110
 here so that it is not I had a lot that and 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.980
 given that we want to put it back 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.650
 to the normal state here the age 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.459
 then we have the microphone to this 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.590
 scope and music also here at 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.979
 normal having this configuration 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.070
 you give him here the music mud 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.940
 will automatically go down I will give 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.400
 a plugin 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.910
 notice that the music is here 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.850
 and when I squeezed the microphone 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.640
 music automatically lowers notice 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.150
 as the waves went down and the microphone 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.849
 is above that music if in given 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.849
 case 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.059
 the microphone is not above the 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:55.409
 music you can come down here and leave 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:58.340
 the music there perfect and so goes to 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:01.150
 stay when you 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.630
 remove the microphone 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.230
 the music will remain as you 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.560
 they have left it and leave it like this 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.770
 as I marked it here and they 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.420
 continue to go out by those in power to 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.270
 a normal sound although you can 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.190
 listen lower on your speakers but 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.890
 in the frames it's ticking in 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.550
 yellow when it does not mark here 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:33.280
 even to a point of yellow because 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.360
 because this is an independent audio to 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.750
 encoder now well we have something very 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.590
 fundamental as it is a return in the 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.840
 microphone 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.460
 I do not take it off because I'm guided by that 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.220
 microphone although it has a little bit of 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.570
 retal the delay sorry but for me not 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.889
 it is inconvenient but if for you it is 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.259
 that 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.199
 that return is inconvenient they go here 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:02.529
 where it says audio mixer configuration 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.819
 pipe the link and give it here where it says 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:08.939
 encoder voice effects destination 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:12.400
 encoder and they give you do not immediately believe 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:16.180
 the voice of the microphone is going to be directed 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:21.240
 to be directed to the cast there and not to 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:25.229
 audio pipe or the output line 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.960
 the shampoo caster ok in education its 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:30.300
 microphone does not have much volume for 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.050
 life issues 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.599
 you when you open the equalizer 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.420
 and they will give him and they will upload him to everything 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:41.830
 the equalizer to everything 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.220
 this is to go up 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.620
 the microphone volumes take in 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.790
 mind that they do not saturate please and they are going 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.160
 to apply the in outlet and they give ok 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.130
 is for the microphone to have more 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.370
 volume but I do not recommend it or better 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:05.370
 said I think it is not necessary but I do not know 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.370
 really if it goes 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.390
 to need it but I think I do not think 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:14.870
 that they will not need me 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.460
 this has been all that is necessary 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.950
 for the sam brooke configuration 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.010
 caster any doubt or suggestion a lot 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:25.370
 more let me know leave your comments 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:28.520
 and visit my website www radio point 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.830
 electric dotcom where I have several 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.750
 tutorials referring to many things 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.210
 especially in terms of transmissions 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.410
 online and much more 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.409
 says goodbye as always like 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.809
 highlight the expected 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:43.229
 I'll leave you there until next
