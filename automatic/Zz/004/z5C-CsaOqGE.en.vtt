00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.890
 how do you stay if I tell you that in the sea 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.160
 there are giant squids of more than 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.780
 six stories high 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.930
 they are squids that can reach 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.000
 reach between 18 or 19 meters in the case 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.720
 of the females these giant squid 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.369
 they are also nicknamed architeuthis 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 already from the fourth century before 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.590
 Christ-with Aristotle they began to see 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.019
 some reports of sightings nobody 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.369
 I thought that this was real until in 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.580
 the year 1887 a corpse was collected from a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.360
 giant squid of an architheuthis of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.340
 more than 16 meters in length however 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 it is not the only giant squid that has 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.770
 collected by almost all the oceans 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.530
 of the world we can find remains of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.120
 Giant squids there are many museums that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.520
 they keep precisely these specimens 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 because they are amazing, people stay 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.130
 amazed to see that they can exist 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.740
 these fabulous creatures in the ocean 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.710
 in fact, they can weigh 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.970
 about 300 kilos and have two tentacles 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 of more than 12 meters are huge 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.340
 with a kind of suckers that in turn 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.440
 they have some teeth inside so they do not 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.110
 they are as harmless as people think 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.260
 in the event that a giant squid 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.030
 will catch with those tentacles not you 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.320
 I would eat because it is not fed 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.520
 feeds only from small 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.310
 crustaceans and some fish but if you 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.490
 would cause them serious injuries and for 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.040
 of course if he used the strength of his 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.780
 tentacles could get to crush without 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.200
 no problem we are talking about a 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.479
 of a specimen over 18 meters 19 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.240
 meters come to say some that can 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.970
 get to measure that favorite food of 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.640
 sperm whales sperm whales are engaged 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.380
 to hunt these squids for all 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 oceans for it are capable of 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.840
 submerge up to two thousand meters to 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.160
 find them where there is hardly any light 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.720
 that's where these creatures live 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.030
 from the fourth century before Christ 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.250
 until now there have been numerous 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 reports of these creatures especially 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.150
 in the 20th century 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.980
 for example where I live in Spain in 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.290
 The coasts of Spain can also be 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.939
 find 600 meters to 1000 meters from 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.629
 depth thousand two thousand meters of 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.590
 depth 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.870
 some of these giant squid 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.019
 do not worry because they do not amount to 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.989
 the surface but if one day you do 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.140
 scuba diving keep in mind that it is very 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.440
 Maybe one day you will see this species 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.750
 of gigantic creature 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.090
 in short a curiosity an animal 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.980
 totally amazing that I had to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.110
 appear here in the animals section 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.110
 almost mandatory
