00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
original CX 10 flip and it's just as

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
original CX 10 flip and it's just as
easy<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.229> push<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.829> stick

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
easy to do just push the right stick

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.560 
easy to do just push the right stick
down<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.759> while<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> transmitters

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
down and then while the transmitters

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.969 
down and then while the transmitters

direction<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.399> want<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> flip<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.110> did<00:01:52.110> have

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
direction you want to flip I did have

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.410 
direction you want to flip I did have
one<00:01:52.770> problem<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> aircraft<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.299> may

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
one problem with the aircraft but it may

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
one problem with the aircraft but it may
just<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.720> me<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.649> transmitter<00:01:56.219> signal<00:01:56.610> did

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
just be me the transmitter signal did

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
just be me the transmitter signal did
drop<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> few<00:01:57.719> times<00:01:57.899> during<00:01:58.350> flight<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
drop out a few times during flight and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
drop out a few times during flight and
I'm<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.070> sure<00:01:59.250> exactly<00:01:59.640> what<00:01:59.909> caused<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
I'm not sure exactly what caused it the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.350 
I'm not sure exactly what caused it the
original<00:02:01.469> CX<00:02:01.799> 10<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:02.430> had<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> same<00:02:02.820> problem

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
but I was able to fix it by putting some

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.620 
but I was able to fix it by putting some
paper<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> battery<00:02:05.909> compartment<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.479> keep
