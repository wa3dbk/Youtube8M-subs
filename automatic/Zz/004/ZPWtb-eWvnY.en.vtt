00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello welcome to our operation 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.710
 cooperative technology with guillermo 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.940
 hi evaluation how about 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.060
 hi how about today you bring us another command 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.699
 game for exact iphones 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.350
 we have the powers of logitech that 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.960
 good is this that you can see here 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.550
 presented a few weeks ago and finally what 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.690
 we have with us we have many 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.640
 you win because it looks really good 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.310
 We really want to try it if you remember the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.110
 same way that they promise is called if the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.900
 iphone iphone we had tried the one of 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.489
 android a couple of them the little one the 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.590
 big 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.270
 we have tried the special mega for 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.190
 iphone 5 not so recently we tried it 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.200
 it worked very well and this is another 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.750
 option is another option that we liked 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.920
 quite and it still looks like this 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.100
 of gigantic portable console but 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.100
 good 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.340
 Well this is what I like the most 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.290
 of this above all is the design mode 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.629
 It was very good it's a good option but 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.150
 This one is more robust does not give the feeling 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.520
 although you never drop it on your mobile 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
 does not give that feeling for anything and for 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.190
 supposed 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.600
 has the advantage over those of android 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.910
 that being destined to a single 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.550
 phone or good two but with the same 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.620
 design does not have to walk with things of 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.570
 subjection I do not know who you put it and it works 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.490
 otherwise, well, he has the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.760
 traditional buttons four buttons 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.360
 this is sticks and a pad and well 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.860
 for titles that by now there are 2.3 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.300
 on a web page that we've seen that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.390
 they had a pretty pretty list 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.830
 great there is that you have to look at me a 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 of the things that I like 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.190
 devices that are super light that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 in fact when you take it out of the box 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.930
 It seems too light but I am 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.420
 studied because you hit the iphone 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.510
 5 the iphone 5 that in this case and already 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.550
 they have the weight the exact weight of one of 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.619
 a small laptop and a console 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.110
 exact and that we do not forget that inside 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.720
 they have a battery in this case 1500 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 milliamperios that good is not very much 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.140
 would not give to complete a load of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.759
 phone for example but is that the idea 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.410
 is not that the idea is that while you 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.159
 you play you are not spending the battery 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.349
 spent 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.470
 it's pretty good because that's why what 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.540
 you say you play and the battery 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.610
 Phone charge charge good charge 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.700
 prevents you from losing a lot of battery and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.940
 that then using perfect hook 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.379
 as we can see and order that one to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 charge to charge that internal battery 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.480
 comes with its cable to load inks 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.860
 Exactly so it has good for little 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.569
 we can access all the functions 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.160
 of the phone to go up to lower the volume or 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.620
 put it in silent mode block the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.170
 screen if we want to put the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.540
 headset and well here you have a button 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.879
 ignition is not especially expensive it is not 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.260
 cheap 99.99 euros that is pretty much the 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.260
 price that we are seeing in this type 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.470
 of devices that is not much where 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.140
 scratch there and good to me it has already been said 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.090
 What I like the most is the design 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.480
 overall finish we do not carry the card 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.530
 back in a pastor a good touch that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.540
 facilitates the grip so that we are not 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.090
 then the only problem falls 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.700
 that may have maybe is the size that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.140
 is the one that has to have but of course it is 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.849
 Much bigger than the phone 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.500
 so then to take it over if not 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.930
 We carry a backpack or a bag of some 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.090
 type is a little 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.099
 and another of the things that impress us 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.439
 with the magician and what happens again here is 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.170
 that does not require any installation of 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.909
 no bone type plugs and games 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.239
 Exactly in some games you have to 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:30.099
 specify what do you want the controls for 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.299
 buttons but good is the logical thing is in 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.209
 the games in which the other kind of 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.010
 controls by tilting it on the device 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.569
 and it works very well we have tried it with 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.829
 some of the others available by 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.120
 now in the catalog it's a bit scarce 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.579
 but well that's the usual 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.109
 it will end up growing and one will 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.060
 because in addition apple seems to bet 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.950
 enough for this with the new connector 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.379
 with the new phones he wants to be 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.359
 begin to develop this kind of 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.010
 peripherals because good in the end do 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.200
 of the phone one more game platform 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.090
 we had already seen it but it was a 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.829
 platform a little different because everything 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.870
 I had to be focused on the tactile game 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.659
 more with movement this already allows 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.129
 more complex deeper games like this 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.780
 how good we'll see enough of this 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.370
 during this year you think we will arrive 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.090
 to see an apple's own device or 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.530
 prefers 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.630
 let it burst while apple 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.360
 for a long time what you have tried 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.770
 focus is the ipod touch as its 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.990
 game device other than 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.460
 Player is the device for whom 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.560
 do not want to spend what it costs a 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.270
 iphone or who already has a phone but 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.670
 want to access the ios catalog 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.830
 and ipod touch while still having the 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.200
 same size as iphone 5 or iphone 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.510
 of the top of each year will continue 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.100
 being compatible but I do not think they go 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.540
 to launch their devices while 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.280
 from Android yes there have been rumors of 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.320
 that google is developing some kind 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.270
 console console to play and so on 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.020
 in apple I would be very surprised that 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.430
 we would have good so here you have a what 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.800
 we are testing works pretty well 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.540
 that we always have said look for the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.280
 compatible video games that every time 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.500
 they will grow and in the end, good is a 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.750
 good is a good device for 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.280
 a good option they want to be before whom 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.320
 has abandoned the laptops that each 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.630
 time they are more if for the game it is 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.360
 past the mobile has a reason that 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.860
 rejoice very well put another 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.330
 more device to play with your 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.060
 iphone from iphone 5 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.789
 and we'll see more hope we hope 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.009
 thank you very much for coming 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.840
 and you and I already summon you to this video 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.500
