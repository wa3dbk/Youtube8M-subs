obviously this brings up the issue of
swapping<00:01:37.229> professions<00:01:37.860> later<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.579> an

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
swapping professions later on in an

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
swapping professions later on in an
expansion<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.810> happens<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.380> can't

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
expansion what happens if you can't

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.569 
expansion what happens if you can't
repeat<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.100> quest

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
repeat that quest

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.789 
repeat that quest
well<00:01:42.390> while<00:01:42.990> running<00:01:43.259> through<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> few

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
well while running through a few

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.289 
well while running through a few
dungeons<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> level<00:01:44.759> 100

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
dungeons on a level 100

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
dungeons on a level 100
I<00:01:45.390> saw<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.350> same<00:01:46.680> quest<00:01:47.100> items<00:01:47.520> drop

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
I saw those very same quest items drop

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.480 
I saw those very same quest items drop
off<00:01:48.119> random<00:01:48.659> monsters<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.290> also<00:01:49.770> had<00:01:50.040> some<00:01:50.070> drop

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
off random monsters I also had some drop

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850 
off random monsters I also had some drop
from<00:01:50.700> open<00:01:51.060> world<00:01:51.240> monsters<00:01:51.450> too<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.020> hadn't

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
from open world monsters too I hadn't

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.770 
from open world monsters too I hadn't
seen<00:01:53.159> any<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> production<00:01:54.240> profession

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
seen any of the production profession

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
seen any of the production profession
quest<00:01:55.079> items<00:01:55.500> drop<00:01:55.799> until<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.790> messing

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
quest items drop until I was messing

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.690 
quest items drop until I was messing
around<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.750> level<00:01:57.990> 100<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.430> safe<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
around on that level 100 so it's safe to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
around on that level 100 so it's safe to
assume<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.630> hit<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> certain<00:02:01.110> level

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
assume that when you hit a certain level

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.550 
assume that when you hit a certain level
threshold<00:02:02.090> probably<00:02:03.090> 100<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.350> any

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
threshold probably 100 you can get any

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
threshold probably 100 you can get any
of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> profession<00:02:05.280> items<00:02:05.579> from<00:02:05.729> anywhere<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
of the profession items from anywhere in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.169 
of the profession items from anywhere in
the<00:02:06.540> game<00:02:07.250> production<00:02:08.250> professions<00:02:08.970> will

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the game production professions will

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.820 
the game production professions will
still<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:09.959> through<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.289> quest<00:02:10.560> line

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
still have to go through that quest line

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.190 
still have to go through that quest line
which<00:02:11.160> isn't<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.819> bad<00:02:12.090> thing<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.629> seems<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.110> be

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
which isn't a bad thing it seems to be

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.970 
which isn't a bad thing it seems to be
the<00:02:13.319> only<00:02:13.500> way<00:02:13.709> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the only way to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
the only way to
your<00:02:14.310> profession<00:02:14.760> garrison<00:02:15.180> building<00:02:15.450> anyway

your profession garrison building anyway
once<00:02:16.739> again<00:02:17.040> you'll<00:02:17.220> need<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.459> have<00:02:17.550> the
