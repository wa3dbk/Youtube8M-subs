creature beatdown combo or some sort of
control<00:04:26.190> lockdown<00:04:26.840> since<00:04:27.840> we<00:04:27.960> are<00:04:28.050> playing

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
control lockdown since we are playing

control lockdown since we are playing
red<00:04:28.560> creature<00:04:29.100> beatdown<00:04:29.550> seems<00:04:29.850> like<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
red creature beatdown seems like the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.900 
red creature beatdown seems like the
most<00:04:30.210> obvious<00:04:30.450> route<00:04:31.050> but<00:04:31.740> combo<00:04:32.370> may<00:04:32.520> also<00:04:32.670> be

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
most obvious route but combo may also be

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.690 
most obvious route but combo may also be
a<00:04:32.940> viable<00:04:33.180> option<00:04:33.650> red<00:04:34.650> loves<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:35.100> kill<00:04:35.280> lands

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
a viable option red loves to kill lands

a viable option red loves to kill lands
so<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> form<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.450> control<00:04:36.720> lockdown<00:04:37.320> could<00:04:37.620> also

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
so a form of control lockdown could also

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.570 
so a form of control lockdown could also
be<00:04:37.980> used<00:04:38.220> if<00:04:38.700> your<00:04:38.970> play<00:04:39.150> group<00:04:39.360> is<00:04:39.450> cool<00:04:39.630> flan

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580
