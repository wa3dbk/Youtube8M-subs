this<00:00:02.460> tutorial<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.389> writing<00:00:04.290> systems

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
this tutorial is about writing systems

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.179 
this tutorial is about writing systems
of<00:00:05.400> linear<00:00:05.580> equations<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:07.379> matrix<00:00:07.410> vector

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
of linear equations in a matrix vector

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.589 
of linear equations in a matrix vector
form<00:00:10.340> some<00:00:11.340> preliminary<00:00:11.910> knowledge<00:00:12.179> of

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
form some preliminary knowledge of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.650 
form some preliminary knowledge of
matrices<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.259> vectors<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:14.009> assumed<00:00:14.630> so<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
matrices and vectors is assumed so I

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.450 
matrices and vectors is assumed so I
will<00:00:15.900> now<00:00:15.990> go<00:00:16.230> into<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.770> very<00:00:17.010> low-level

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
will now go into the very low-level

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640 
will now go into the very low-level
details<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> will<00:00:19.050> include<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.500> much

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
details but I will include as much

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.400 
details but I will include as much
detail<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.180> necessary<00:00:21.410> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
detail as I think is necessary to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.840 
detail as I think is necessary to
perform<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> operations<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.609> I'll<00:00:23.699> be

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
perform the operations that I'll be

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.009 
perform the operations that I'll be
talking<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.269> example<00:00:27.750> let's

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
talking about so for example let's

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.570 
talking about so for example let's
suppose<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.099> system<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
suppose that you have a system of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
suppose that you have a system of
equations<00:00:30.090> consisting<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.750> three<00:00:31.109> variables

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
equations consisting of three variables

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:51.319 
equations consisting of three variables
and<00:00:31.890> three<00:00:32.540> equations

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.950 

the<00:00:51.899> first<00:00:52.170> equation<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.800> X<00:00:53.309> 1<00:00:53.610> plus<00:00:53.820> 2<00:00:54.300> X<00:00:54.450> 2

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the first equation is X 1 plus 2 X 2

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:10.940 
the first equation is X 1 plus 2 X 2
minus<00:00:55.620> 4<00:00:56.160> X<00:00:56.399> 3<00:00:56.760> equals<00:00:57.540> 3

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:27.899 

the<00:01:11.460> second<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> 2<00:01:12.600> X<00:01:12.840> 1<00:01:13.140> plus<00:01:13.409> 2<00:01:13.799> X<00:01:14.070> 3<00:01:14.610> equals<00:01:15.420> 4

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.679 

and<00:01:27.999> the<00:01:28.630> third<00:01:28.869> one<00:01:29.079> is<00:01:29.320> negative<00:01:29.920> x<00:01:30.310> 1<00:01:30.640> -<00:01:31.210> 2<00:01:31.450> X

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
and the third one is negative x 1 - 2 X

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.510 
and the third one is negative x 1 - 2 X
2<00:01:31.960> equals<00:01:32.799> 0<00:01:33.960> notice<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.289> I<00:01:35.350> aligned<00:01:35.950> all<00:01:36.340> of

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
2 equals 0 notice that I aligned all of

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.300 
2 equals 0 notice that I aligned all of
the<00:01:36.640> variables<00:01:37.210> vertically<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.679> is<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.069> help

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the variables vertically this is to help

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.999 
the variables vertically this is to help
visualize<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.359> next<00:01:40.689> step<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:41.140> little<00:01:41.770> bit

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
visualize the next step a little bit

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.520 
visualize the next step a little bit
better<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.649> can<00:01:44.859> be<00:01:45.009> rewritten<00:01:45.219> in<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
better this can be rewritten in the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:59.099 
better this can be rewritten in the
following<00:01:47.950> way<00:01:51.990> X<00:01:52.990> 1<00:01:53.409> times<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:55.030> vector<00:01:56.189> 1<00:01:57.189> 2<00:01:58.109> -

following way X 1 times the vector 1 2 -

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:16.160 
following way X 1 times the vector 1 2 -

X 3 times the vector negative 4 - 0 and
all<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.829> this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.340> equal<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:28.989> hand

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
all of this is equal to the right hand

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:38.309 
all of this is equal to the right hand

says<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.209> vector<00:02:41.370> 1<00:02:42.370> 2

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
says is that we have a vector 1 2

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.500 
says is that we have a vector 1 2
negative<00:02:43.780> 1<00:02:43.810> which<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.560> coefficients<00:02:45.400> of

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
negative 1 which is the coefficients of

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.379 
negative 1 which is the coefficients of
the<00:02:46.510> variable<00:02:46.900> X<00:02:47.079> 1<00:02:47.410> plus<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> vector<00:02:48.760> 2<00:02:49.000> 0

the variable X 1 plus the vector 2 0
negative<00:02:49.840> 2<00:02:50.230> which<00:02:50.889> are<00:02:51.069> getting<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
negative 2 which are getting the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.479 
negative 2 which are getting the
coefficients<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.290> variable<00:02:53.739> X<00:02:53.950> 2<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.459> so

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
coefficients of the variable X 2 and so

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.069 
coefficients of the variable X 2 and so
on<00:02:55.389> and<00:02:55.870> we<00:02:56.230> say<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.530> equal<00:02:56.829> to<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.069> vector<00:02:57.430> of

corresponding<00:03:08.680> elements<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:10.389> vectors

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
corresponding elements in the vectors

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.229

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
minus 4 times X 3 is equal to 3 which is

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.599 
minus 4 times X 3 is equal to 3 which is
exactly<00:03:20.650> what<00:03:20.919> we<00:03:21.010> had<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.519> original

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
and the third equation present here now

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.289 
and the third equation present here now
we<00:03:31.629> can<00:03:31.660> combine<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:33.310> left-hand<00:03:33.790> side<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.180> the

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
we can combine the left-hand side of the

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.129 
we can combine the left-hand side of the
equality<00:03:34.889> into<00:03:35.889> a<00:03:35.919> matrix<00:03:36.639> times<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.449> single

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
equality into a matrix times a single

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.330 
equality into a matrix times a single
vector

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
vector

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.570 
vector
this<00:03:40.330> arises<00:03:40.690> from<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.830> fact<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.400> can

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
this arises from the fact that you can

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.390 
this arises from the fact that you can
rewrite<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.810> kind<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.290> system<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
we are trying to find so this can be

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:36.750
