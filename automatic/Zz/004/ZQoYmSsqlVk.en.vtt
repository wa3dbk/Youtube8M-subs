particular<00:03:32.630> column<00:03:33.020> is<00:03:33.110> in<00:03:33.260> fact<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.650> has<00:03:33.860> so

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
particular column is in fact it has so

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.970 
particular column is in fact it has so
many<00:03:34.340> compound<00:03:34.820> curves<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.710> so<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:36.860> real

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
many compound curves and so the real

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.920 
many compound curves and so the real
skill<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.550> in<00:03:37.700> being<00:03:38.030> able<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.270> have<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.540> match

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
skill is in being able to have it match

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.950 
skill is in being able to have it match
it<00:03:39.260> not<00:03:39.440> only<00:03:39.590> heard<00:03:40.210> some<00:03:41.210> size<00:03:41.420> for<00:03:41.750> apps

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.260 
it not only heard some size for apps
websites<00:03:42.260> are<00:03:42.710> in<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.030> get<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
websites are in and I have to get the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.300 
websites are in and I have to get the
top<00:03:44.510> perfectly<00:03:45.050> flat<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:45.740> these<00:03:45.920> these<00:03:46.250> are

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
top perfectly flat so these these are

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.460 
top perfectly flat so these these are
legs<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.910> will<00:03:47.000> be<00:03:47.120> attached<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.930> inner

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
legs it will be attached to the in inner

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.740 
legs it will be attached to the in inner
surface<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.160> then<00:03:49.700> I'll<00:03:49.880> then<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.300> have<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.480> cut

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
surface and then I'll then I have to cut

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.950 
surface and then I'll then I have to cut
on<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:51.140> tabletop<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:52.010> go<00:03:52.130> with<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.720> that's<00:03:53.720> a

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
on a tabletop to go with it and that's a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.660 
on a tabletop to go with it and that's a
that's<00:03:54.500> probably<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.130> hardest<00:03:55.400> part<00:03:55.610> of

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
that's probably the hardest part of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:26.120 
that's probably the hardest part of
doing

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:05:11.410 

you

and maybe some grain this one came out

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.830 
and maybe some grain this one came out
probably<00:05:42.300> as<00:05:43.400> nice<00:05:44.400> or<00:05:44.640> nicer<00:05:44.880> than<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.630> first

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
probably as nice or nicer than the first

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.720 
probably as nice or nicer than the first
we've<00:05:45.990> ever<00:05:46.110> done<00:05:46.290> the<00:05:46.440> first<00:05:46.590> one<00:05:46.770> I<00:05:46.920> really

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
we've ever done the first one I really

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.420 
we've ever done the first one I really
enjoy<00:05:48.420> these<00:05:48.690> l-1011<00:05:49.410> because<00:05:49.770> of<00:05:50.040> this<00:05:50.160> angle

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
enjoy these l-1011 because of this angle

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.100 
enjoy these l-1011 because of this angle
on<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.730> I<00:05:50.940> think<00:05:51.120> it's<00:05:51.210> just<00:05:51.270> way<00:05:52.080> more

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
on it I think it's just way more

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.040 
on it I think it's just way more
attractive<00:05:52.530> in<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:52.920> 747<00:05:53.760> we<00:05:54.630> could<00:05:54.780> do<00:05:54.900> that

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
attractive in the 747 we could do that

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.680 
attractive in the 747 we could do that
too<00:05:55.260> to<00:05:55.560> them<00:05:55.680> too<00:05:55.920> it's<00:05:56.520> just<00:05:56.760> how<00:05:56.880> we<00:05:56.910> cut<00:05:57.570> the

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
too to them too it's just how we cut the

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.230 
too to them too it's just how we cut the
bottom<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:58.260> 747s<00:05:59.010> on<00:05:59.100> iCarly<00:05:59.550> yeah<00:05:59.820> but<00:06:00.120> it

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
bottom of the 747s on iCarly yeah but it

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.820 
bottom of the 747s on iCarly yeah but it
doesn't<00:06:00.330> have<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:00.780> natural<00:06:01.050> swoosh<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.710> it

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
doesn't have this natural swoosh to it

but<00:06:07.080> this<00:06:07.170> this<00:06:07.440> came<00:06:07.710> out<00:06:08.420> super<00:06:09.420> I<00:06:09.600> like<00:06:10.200> the

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
but this this came out super I like the

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.900 
but this this came out super I like the
way<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.620> Vince<00:06:11.990> events<00:06:12.990> came<00:06:13.200> out<00:06:13.610> I'm<00:06:14.610> glad

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
way the Vince events came out I'm glad

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.910

we<00:06:15.150> didn't<00:06:15.390> expose<00:06:15.780> those<00:06:16.020> air<00:06:16.230> bottles<00:06:16.710> there

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
we didn't expose those air bottles there

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.710 
we didn't expose those air bottles there
i<00:06:16.950> think<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.430> would<00:06:17.520> look<00:06:17.580> tacky<00:06:18.030> yeah<00:06:18.600> yeah

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
i think that would look tacky yeah yeah

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.480 
i think that would look tacky yeah yeah
and<00:06:21.720> then<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.170> policy<00:06:22.650> on<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.890> inside<00:06:23.280> looks

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
and then the policy on the inside looks

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:37.780 
and then the policy on the inside looks
great<00:06:23.730> too

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:55.100 

you

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:07.170
