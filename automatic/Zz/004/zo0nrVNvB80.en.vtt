which<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.590> use<00:00:10.889> I've<00:00:11.099> also<00:00:11.250> got<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.820> heavy-duty

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
which I use I've also got a heavy-duty

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.269 
which I use I've also got a heavy-duty
video<00:00:13.469> tripod<00:00:13.940> got<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.240> glidetrak<00:00:16.279> system

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
video tripod got the glidetrak system

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730 
video tripod got the glidetrak system
for<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.449> hybrid<00:00:18.840> system<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.439> I've<00:00:19.560> got

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
for is the hybrid system that I've got

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.670 
for is the hybrid system that I've got
so<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.670> rolls<00:00:21.240> very<00:00:21.480> smoothly<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.439> that's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
so it's it rolls very smoothly so that's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.990 
so it's it rolls very smoothly so that's
that's<00:00:22.949> all<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.250> getting<00:00:23.490> smoothness

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that's all about getting smoothness

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.859 
that's all about getting smoothness
however<00:00:24.779> there's<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.529> major<00:00:26.310> flaw<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.240> all

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
however there's one major flaw in all

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.820 
however there's one major flaw in all

shakes or vibrations can come from now
is<00:00:41.460> me<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.690> much<00:00:42.719> cheeks<00:00:43.350> or

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
is me and it's not so much cheeks or

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
is me and it's not so much cheeks or
vibrations<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.309> also<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:45.320> if<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:47.160> in

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
vibrations it's also just if you are in

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
vibrations it's also just if you are in
inconstant<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:51.000> motion<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
inconstant with your motion so if you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.869 
inconstant with your motion so if you
kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.219> faster<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
kind of go a little bit faster that's a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
kind of go a little bit faster that's a
little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.239> faster<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.890> don't

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
little bit faster so I just you don't

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.360 
little bit faster so I just you don't
get<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> smooth<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.930> speed<00:00:58.370> then

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
get it smooth with the speed then

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.119 
get it smooth with the speed then
there's<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.879> super<00:01:00.660> duper<00:01:01.050> mega<00:01:01.350> important

little rubber band which the postman

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.580 
little rubber band which the postman
will<00:01:30.570> drop<00:01:30.750> off<00:01:30.930> where<00:01:31.079> he's<00:01:31.259> dropping<00:01:31.500> off

to do so much more editing afterwards

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.190 
to do so much more editing afterwards
but<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.710> were<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> record<00:02:02.430> this

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
but you know so if I were to record this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
but you know so if I were to record this
and<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.439> did<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:04.890> hand<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.399> would<00:02:06.030> say

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and if I did with my hand I would say

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
and if I did with my hand I would say
I'm<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.869> damn<00:02:07.170> good<00:02:07.409> at<00:02:07.469> this

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I'm pretty damn good at this

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.580 
I'm pretty damn good at this
however<00:02:08.330> when<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.629> doing<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.170> hand<00:02:10.470> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
however when I'm doing it with my hand I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.960 
however when I'm doing it with my hand I
can<00:02:10.739> feel<00:02:10.979> bits<00:02:11.190> which

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
can feel bits which

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.430 
can feel bits which
a<00:02:12.000> little<00:02:12.270> bit<00:02:12.360> faster<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.810> little<00:02:12.990> bit<00:02:13.200> slower

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a little bit faster a little bit slower

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.250 
a little bit faster a little bit slower
and<00:02:13.970> maybe<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.270> try<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.720> speed<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:15.930> where

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and maybe then I try and speed up where

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
and maybe then I try and speed up where
it's<00:02:16.410> true<00:02:16.680> or<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> try<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> slow<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.850> it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
it's true or I try to slow down and it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.330 
it's true or I try to slow down and it
becomes<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.360> nightmare<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.140> better<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.680> just

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
becomes a nightmare so better is just

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.630 
becomes a nightmare so better is just
having<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.420> rubber<00:02:21.630> band<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.620> pulling<00:02:23.520> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
having the rubber band and pulling it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.980 
having the rubber band and pulling it
very<00:02:23.880> gently<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.360> also<00:02:24.570> gives<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.960> a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
very gently there also gives you a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.770 
very gently there also gives you a
smoother<00:02:25.410> start<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.070> think<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:32.300> never<00:02:33.300> try<00:02:33.720> and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
smoother start I think and never try and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.490 
smoother start I think and never try and
touch<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.260> end<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.940> way<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:37.260> rubber

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
touch the end and that way the rubber

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.850 
touch the end and that way the rubber
band<00:02:37.770> takes<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.370> any<00:02:38.580> kind<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.830> reaction<00:02:40.830> that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
band takes out any kind of reaction that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.860 
band takes out any kind of reaction that
you<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.670> any<00:02:41.820> resistance<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.720> in

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
you have to any resistance that is in

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.320 
you have to any resistance that is in
the<00:02:42.960> track<00:02:43.230> or<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:44.280> system<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.180> you're

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the track or the system that you're

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.970 
the track or the system that you're
using<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:46.080> long<00:02:46.200> as<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.440> tracking<00:02:46.860> as

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
using and as long as with tracking as

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.310 
using and as long as with tracking as
well<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.940> were<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.240> do<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> panning<00:02:48.870> shot

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
well so if I were to do a panning shot

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.880 
well so if I were to do a panning shot
I<00:02:50.240> would<00:02:51.240> loosen<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.110> bit<00:02:52.790> tighten<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.000> bit

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
I would loosen this bit tighten that bit

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.320 
I would loosen this bit tighten that bit
and<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.070> bring<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> rubber<00:02:56.430> band<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.240> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and just bring the rubber band up to the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.090 
and just bring the rubber band up to the
back<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.810> and<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> camera<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.040> in

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
back here and get the camera so it's in

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.560 
back here and get the camera so it's in
the<00:03:02.160> right<00:03:02.220> position<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.240> would<00:03:03.390> just

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the right position and I would just

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.490 
the right position and I would just
track<00:03:04.350> or<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> pan<00:03:05.870> with<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.900> rubber<00:03:07.230> band

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
track or do a pan with the rubber band

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.740 
track or do a pan with the rubber band
and<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.800> can<00:03:07.980> never<00:03:08.310> go<00:03:08.580> slow<00:03:09.030> enough<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.540> what

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
and you can never go slow enough is what

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.480 
and you can never go slow enough is what
I<00:03:09.780> would<00:03:10.050> always<00:03:10.170> say<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:12.440> can<00:03:13.440> always<00:03:13.620> speed

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
I would always say you can always speed

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.210 
I would always say you can always speed
up<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.880> post<00:03:15.240> very<00:03:15.690> easily<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.590> slowing<00:03:16.920> down

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
up in post very easily but slowing down

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.890 
up in post very easily but slowing down
you<00:03:17.700> don't<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.360> lot<00:03:18.690> of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
you don't really have a lot of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.570 
you don't really have a lot of
opportunity<00:03:19.530> especially<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.400> you're

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
opportunity especially if you're

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.979 
opportunity especially if you're
shooting<00:03:20.670> at<00:03:20.910> 30<00:03:21.090> frames<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.480> second<00:03:21.870> which<00:03:21.959> is

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
shooting at 30 frames a second which is

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.009 
shooting at 30 frames a second which is
fastest<00:03:22.500> which<00:03:22.650> I'm<00:03:22.800> doing<00:03:22.980> at<00:03:23.040> Full<00:03:23.220> HD<00:03:23.250> here

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
fastest which I'm doing at Full HD here

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.400 
fastest which I'm doing at Full HD here
as<00:03:25.019> slow<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.500> bring<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.890> into<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:27.410> 80%

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
as slow as I can bring it into is a 80%

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.770 
as slow as I can bring it into is a 80%
speed<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.580> brings<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.850> into<00:03:29.970> 24<00:03:30.480> frames<00:03:30.690> a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
speed so that brings it into 24 frames a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.410 
speed so that brings it into 24 frames a
second<00:03:31.140> if<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.760> you're<00:03:32.910> already<00:03:33.030> shooting

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
second if a if you're already shooting

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.650 
second if a if you're already shooting
out<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.600> pal<00:03:33.810> setting<00:03:34.380> PL<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.220> then<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.330> can't

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
out a pal setting PL and then you can't

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.340 
out a pal setting PL and then you can't
really<00:03:36.750> slow<00:03:37.080> down<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.560> all<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.350> whenever

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
really slow down at all so whenever

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.500 
really slow down at all so whenever
you're<00:03:40.590> shooting<00:03:40.890> video<00:03:41.160> do<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.700> as<00:03:41.790> slow<00:03:42.299> as

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
you're shooting video do it as slow as

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.030 
you're shooting video do it as slow as
you<00:03:42.570> can<00:03:42.660> because<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.320> can<00:03:43.530> always<00:03:43.680> speed<00:03:43.950> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
you can because you can always speed it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.430 
you can because you can always speed it
up<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.570> also<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.660> slower<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
up and also the slower you do it the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.080 
up and also the slower you do it the
