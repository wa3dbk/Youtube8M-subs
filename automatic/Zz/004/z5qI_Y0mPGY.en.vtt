00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello you love today I turn that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.389
 video for you and that is that top 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.950
 and flop the products test video and yes 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.820
 Let's start right now I have 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.380
 Only two products from the drugstore 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 which I am not convinced and indeed 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.710
 first of all this yes this make up that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.550
 is from astor and it is very dull her 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 or 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.010
 yes, it fulfills its purpose completely 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.570
 is very marked and indeed marked 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.640
 that if i am using this make-up 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.969
 here a smear that I 100,000 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 stains on the face because as soon as it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.469
 It looks like it's going to be in your skin 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 Puttrich so stop and if you do it 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.260
 then a little more fresh 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.190
 If you want, then you have to be right 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.440
 prove 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.780
 in otherwise you have quite a lot of spots 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.629
 in the face and it just looks 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.109
 shit out and that's why it is 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.620
 that absolutely flopped me in this 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 Video 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.519
 then i needed a bronx inc or 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 and I'm actually from Manhattan 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.400
 So, what excited about 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 eyeshadow ago by the pigmentation 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.689
 and I thought I'd get one 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 tree sync or manhattan that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.229
 problem is only i have a very 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.450
 fluffy brush with which I mean 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.680
 boxing mandate and if you have this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 Traces used then you need 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.700
 really a very firm brush around 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.009
 a few pigments at all 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.259
 reach so it's also a flop 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.990
 for me then on the contrary is the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.640
 patrice browser very good that my 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.829
 I have an absolute favorite movie 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.130
 it has been bought a lot now 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.530
 nice color of the bronx are the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.090
 Missing has no leaves 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.649
 shimmer or something from me 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.649
 love this browser 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 yes and then either the products 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.890
 from patricia she really is the pure one 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.469
 madness 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.820
 then any of you took me under 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.579
 my picture asked what I for one 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.170
 wearing lipstick and that was it 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.280
 by patrice how can it be different 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.810
 it is the color 240 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.180
 well that's my absolute favorite movie 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.690
 I also always look for the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.959
 I wear the way, now on the lips 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.090
 and he's so creamy 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.810
 consistency 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.739
 then I have another one 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.150
 property of patrice and that is the 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.150
 color 240 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.670
 I 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.920
 and he looks very much like that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.629
 creamy lipstick has such a 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.209
 Peaches I can but im in the 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.730
 show comparison to other things 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.069
 so that he is more nude and the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.790
 has a light orange stitch in it 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.730
 But I am also very well used the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.819
 just a relatively rare stop next 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.389
 product of patrice is mine 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:04.170
 transparent loose powder that's what it means 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:06.599
 and thus have very oily skin 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.840
 Oily skin I needed a powder 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.909
 what matted and there this make-up yes 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.560
 I have had a total problem 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.560
 thought i go back to patrice and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.950
 i got my cat from patrice 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.560
 because this loose powder brought a 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.760
 transparent powder what you like 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.489
 Beauty and then the whole thing comes 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.609
 powder from it is going on in the island 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.650
 and to knock and that 's mine 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.900
 absolute favorite brother you have to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.840
 Although wear several times a day again 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.060
 that's the absolute power again 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.489
 but I'm really like that 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.729
 excited and yes next comes 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.799
 also patrice a camouflage primus 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.989
 a concealer in a very creamy 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.760
 consistency therefore is also very 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.129
 opaque and I love this concealer 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.620
 saturated as beautiful blind and as 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.120
 said the covers also super so 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.659
 really a very nice one too 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.659
 Product next comes my fitness 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.560
 series are those of maybelline 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:17.220
 jade 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.049
 As a first time, I'll fit this make up 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.409
 make up is really the absolute 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.930
 madness and although it is such a make-up 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:27.810
 it was very easy so that really 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.780
 also from the blanket power not very doll 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.340
 and really that easy really 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.969
 so easy on it you really think 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.159
 one has no mega uncertain 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.110
 a concealer you is from fitness me 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.669
 have two artists I use the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.039
 I usually use on the weekend because one 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.899
 is a bit more expensive and he has her like that 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.199
 an applicator with which you can 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:55.399
 Apply mozilla wonderfully and yes then 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:57.379
 just awesome my hangover is black 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:59.509
 completely spray that I had you yes 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.059
 already shown my hair routine video 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.549
 and this spray is really 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.649
 just from Sivas but just so 

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:08.799
 what a dreamlike I can really do 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:12.049
 do not miss this stuff anymore 

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:14.329
 and yes gives a beautiful shine 

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:19.909
 and lets you comb through super easy 

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:22.610
 then next comes my eyelashes 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:26.569
 respectively eyebrow tinting and 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.860
 Although this is beautiful of beauty I am 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.399
 had another before 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.049
 but had had the stupid in that 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:34.729
 which not only colored the hair 

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.639
 but also the skin underneath and it 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.809
 is not the case for us 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.899
 this coloring really drives only the 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:43.099
 hairs and skin underneath and not 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.449
 yes it has such a slight blue cast 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.369
 but I'm not 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.229
 not bad since I have my hair anyway 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:51.079
 again after malle my herrchen 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.479
 eyebrows a beautiful 

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:56.719
 Promotional material for other also lasts forever 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:00.649
 it is here but it can show itself 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:02.569
 this is such a palette there is such a 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.379
 calm brush with both you can do it all 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.209
 stir 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:09.889
 its plates which can keep the eye 

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:11.119
 put a developer krems in it 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.059
 this still full 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:18.110
 I rarely use that and said that 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:19.519
 the color in itself so the color yes 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:25.399
 The whole is also very easy 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:28.669
 Therefore really great nice product then 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:30.529
 a product that I hated at first 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.519
 which I did not realize and that 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:36.709
 This is this ebeling of this beauty 

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.119
 blender and although I have the very on 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.769
 not wet at the beginning and that was 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:41.299
 My mistake in this sponge can be 

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:43.459
 get wet because it gets bigger first 

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:44.160
 and second, it is much better off 

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:46.530
 blind 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.200
 and without them I can swim now 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.620
 I do not even live anymore 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.000
 My make-up works on and on 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.180
 concealer and everything and he really is 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.210
 also a darling of mine really and 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:06.540
 then there are three or four 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:09.360
 I think that's what it was 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.140
 already to my top and flop dark 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.730
 products 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.640
 I have only very little now 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.570

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.610

 How do I test any printed products? 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.370

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.990

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.720
