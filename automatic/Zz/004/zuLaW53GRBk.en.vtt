00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
this is a lighting tutorial so we're

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
this is a lighting tutorial so we're
going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.989> show<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> looks<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.590> the

I'm still not sure if that's really a

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.570 
I'm still not sure if that's really a
thing<00:01:34.900> or<00:01:34.990> not

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
thing or not

thing or not
the<00:01:36.580> very<00:01:36.760> first<00:01:36.940> thing<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.090> want<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.270> do<00:01:37.390> is

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
the very first thing you want to do is

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.330 
the very first thing you want to do is
spray<00:01:38.290> paint<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.590> inside<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.070> clamp

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
spray paint the inside of the clamp

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.430 
spray paint the inside of the clamp
lights<00:01:39.610> with<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.880> white<00:01:40.210> paint<00:01:40.479> this<00:01:41.290> would

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
lights with the white paint this would

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.570 
lights with the white paint this would
take<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.590> couple<00:01:41.740> hours<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.130> dry<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:42.520> you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
take a couple hours to dry so you

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.710 
take a couple hours to dry so you
definitely<00:01:42.940> want<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.090> do<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:43.330> first<00:01:43.570> you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
definitely want to do this first you

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.620 
definitely want to do this first you
also<00:01:43.960> may<00:01:44.229> want<00:01:44.260> to<00:01:44.650> tape<00:01:45.130> up<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.610> socket<00:01:46.450> part

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
also may want to tape up the socket part

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.960 
also may want to tape up the socket part
of<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.780> light<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.229> you<00:01:47.950> don't<00:01:48.130> ruin<00:01:48.670> that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
of the light so that you don't ruin that

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.180 
of the light so that you don't ruin that
connection<00:01:49.330> there<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.770> didn't<00:01:50.979> do<00:01:51.040> that<00:01:51.070> for

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
connection there we didn't do that for

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:01.620 
connection there we didn't do that for
this<00:01:51.370> one<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.690> still<00:01:52.720> works<00:02:00.450> okay<00:02:01.450> let's

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
this one but it still works okay let's

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.969 
this one but it still works okay let's
build<00:02:01.750> some<00:02:01.930> lights<00:02:02.110> first<00:02:02.380> thing<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.650> do<00:02:02.770> is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
build some lights first thing we do is

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.930 
build some lights first thing we do is
uh<00:02:03.600> extend<00:02:04.600> all<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.340> leg<00:02:06.340> stands<00:02:06.610> all<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
uh extend all of the leg stands all the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.320 
uh extend all of the leg stands all the
way<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:08.140> very<00:02:08.410> quick<00:02:09.010> use<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.580> clamp<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
way you very quick use you clamp the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.180 
way you very quick use you clamp the
clamp<00:02:10.720> lights<00:02:10.899> onto<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.350> top<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.950> light

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
clamp lights onto the top of the light

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.530 
clamp lights onto the top of the light
stand<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.610> then<00:02:12.700> we're<00:02:12.850> going<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> reinforce

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
stand and then we're going to reinforce

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.120 
stand and then we're going to reinforce
those<00:02:13.810> clients<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> do<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:14.650> super<00:02:14.950> sturdy

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
those clients to do not super sturdy

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.220 
those clients to do not super sturdy
with<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.910> other<00:02:16.090> clients<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.480> we've<00:02:16.660> bought

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
with the other clients that we've bought

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.550 
with the other clients that we've bought

to show you how to use the how easy it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.130 
to show you how to use the how easy it
is<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.550> clamp<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.720> stuff<00:02:58.989> onto<00:02:59.200> these<00:02:59.500> lights

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
is to clamp this stuff onto these lights

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.390 
is to clamp this stuff onto these lights
as<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.410> tell<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.769> pretty<00:03:02.950> dark<00:03:03.190> in<00:03:03.280> this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
as you can tell it's pretty dark in this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.540 
as you can tell it's pretty dark in this
room<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:04.180> what<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.900> will<00:03:05.410> start<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
room so what we will start with is the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.420 
room so what we will start with is the
key<00:03:06.700> light<00:03:06.880> which<00:03:07.769> will<00:03:08.769> give<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.040> pretty

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
key light which will give you pretty

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.970 
key light which will give you pretty
much<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.940> majority<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.630> light<00:03:10.920> followed<00:03:11.920> by

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
much a majority of the light followed by

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.530 
much a majority of the light followed by
the<00:03:12.040> fill<00:03:12.280> light<00:03:12.459> which<00:03:12.970> will<00:03:13.120> route<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.450> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
the fill light which will route out the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.420 
the fill light which will route out the
shadows<00:03:13.930> on<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:14.950> face

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
shadows on the face

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.660 
shadows on the face
finally<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.570> backlight<00:03:16.989> which<00:03:17.859> will<00:03:18.070> pop<00:03:18.549> you

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
finally the backlight which will pop you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.760 
finally the backlight which will pop you
up<00:03:18.790> from<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> background

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
up from the background

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.860 
up from the background
eliminate<00:03:20.670> any<00:03:20.790> shadows<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.420> hopefully

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
eliminate any shadows and hopefully

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.930 
eliminate any shadows and hopefully
