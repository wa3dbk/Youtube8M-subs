00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
I'm going to show you now the four palm

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.700 
I'm going to show you now the four palm
beehive<00:00:10.660> weave<00:00:11.340> which<00:00:12.340> takes<00:00:13.200> four<00:00:14.200> palm

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
beehive weave which takes four palm

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.249 
beehive weave which takes four palm
branches<00:00:15.370> so<00:00:16.209> when<00:00:16.390> you<00:00:16.509> enter<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:17.020> church

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
branches so when you enter the church

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.769 
branches so when you enter the church
you<00:00:17.590> might<00:00:17.619> want<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.189> grab<00:00:18.310> two<00:00:18.820> and<00:00:19.210> then

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
you might want to grab two and then

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.519 
you might want to grab two and then
split<00:00:20.140> them<00:00:20.380> up<00:00:20.500> into<00:00:20.740> four<00:00:21.520> branches<00:00:21.989> so<00:00:22.989> like

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
split them up into four branches so like

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.450 
split them up into four branches so like
I<00:00:23.680> have<00:00:23.919> here<00:00:24.309> I<00:00:24.520> have<00:00:25.300> two<00:00:25.930> branches<00:00:26.399> that<00:00:27.399> I

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
I have here I have two branches that I

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:37.560 
I have here I have two branches that I
can<00:00:27.820> split<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.719> now<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:36.340> have<00:00:36.790> four

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
can split like so and now I have four

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.210 
can split like so and now I have four
and<00:00:37.870> this<00:00:38.350> is<00:00:38.410> what<00:00:38.740> you<00:00:38.860> need<00:00:39.130> to<00:00:39.790> make<00:00:40.120> your

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
and this is what you need to make your

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.670 
and this is what you need to make your
beehive<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:43.360> as<00:00:43.540> I've<00:00:43.780> said<00:00:44.079> before<00:00:44.140> in<00:00:44.590> the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
beehive now as I've said before in the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.270 
beehive now as I've said before in the
other<00:00:44.710> video<00:00:45.540> you're<00:00:46.540> going<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:46.930> want<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.380> get

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
rid of these stems that run the length

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.190 
rid of these stems that run the length
of<00:00:52.750> your<00:00:53.050> palm<00:00:53.860> branch<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.750> can<00:00:55.930> get<00:00:56.079> rid

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
of your palm branch and you can get rid

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.370 
of your palm branch and you can get rid
of<00:00:56.260> these<00:00:56.500> by<00:00:56.800> sticking<00:00:57.160> your<00:01:00.960> thumbnail<00:01:01.960> in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
of these by sticking your thumbnail in

of these by sticking your thumbnail in
the<00:01:03.100> side<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.740> need<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:05.950> assistance

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
the side and if you need the assistance

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.989 
the side and if you need the assistance
of<00:01:06.700> scissors<00:01:07.119> by<00:01:07.810> all<00:01:07.930> means<00:01:08.259> don't<00:01:08.770> hesitate

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.910 

for<00:01:12.999> this<00:01:13.179> you're<00:01:13.450> going<00:01:13.719> to<00:01:13.840> want<00:01:14.259> them<00:01:14.499> to<00:01:14.740> be

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
for this you're going to want them to be

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.050 
for this you're going to want them to be
around<00:01:15.249> the<00:01:15.460> same<00:01:15.759> length<00:01:16.649> so<00:01:17.649> I'm<00:01:18.340> going<00:01:18.909> to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
around the same length so I'm going to

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.719 
around the same length so I'm going to
cut<00:01:19.299> off<00:01:20.459> some<00:01:21.459> to<00:01:21.819> make<00:01:21.969> them<00:01:22.240> even<00:01:22.569> and<00:01:23.729> just

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
cut off some to make them even and just

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.999 
cut off some to make them even and just
like<00:01:24.909> we<00:01:25.060> did<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.450> other<00:01:25.630> one<00:01:25.990> I'm<00:01:26.289> going<00:01:26.889> to

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
like we did the other one I'm going to

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:34.139 
like we did the other one I'm going to
tie<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.429> ends<00:01:28.329> off<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:33.399> I'm<00:01:33.520> going<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.819> make<00:01:34.119> a

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
tie the ends off so I'm going to make a

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.809 
tie the ends off so I'm going to make a
loop<00:01:34.509> with<00:01:34.810> all<00:01:35.289> of<00:01:35.499> them<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:35.799> might<00:01:35.979> be<00:01:36.130> hard

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
loop with all of them this might be hard

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.330 
loop with all of them this might be hard
since<00:01:37.149> there<00:01:37.359> are<00:01:37.420> four<00:01:37.719> and<00:01:38.020> then<00:01:38.979> I'm<00:01:39.100> going

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
since there are four and then I'm going

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.989 
since there are four and then I'm going
to<00:01:39.369> tuck<00:01:39.670> them<00:01:39.909> in<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:41.100> bam<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.399> got<00:01:42.609> a<00:01:42.639> nice

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
to tuck them in and bam it got a nice

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.379 
to tuck them in and bam it got a nice
knot<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.609> said<00:01:45.670> if<00:01:45.969> this<00:01:46.149> doesn't

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
knot and like I said if this doesn't

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.800 
knot and like I said if this doesn't
work<00:01:46.539> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.409> use<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.700> stapler<00:01:48.700> or<00:01:49.209> some<00:01:49.569> tape

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
work you can use a stapler or some tape

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.589 
work you can use a stapler or some tape
tape<00:01:50.349> is<00:01:50.529> super<00:01:50.829> handy<00:01:51.389> okay

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
tape is super handy okay

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.410 
tape is super handy okay
now<00:01:53.159> starting<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.399> always<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.880> hardest<00:01:55.119> part

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
now starting is always the hardest part

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.819 
now starting is always the hardest part
so<00:01:55.779> be<00:01:56.529> sure<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:57.069> pay<00:01:57.369> attention<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.649> way<00:01:59.799> I

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
so be sure to pay attention the way I

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.239 
so be sure to pay attention the way I
like<00:02:00.249> to<00:02:00.429> do<00:02:00.609> it<00:02:00.759> is<00:02:00.999> take<00:02:01.779> the<00:02:01.990> outermost<00:02:02.349> ones

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
like to do it is take the outermost ones

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.059 
like to do it is take the outermost ones
and<00:02:03.669> spread<00:02:04.240> them<00:02:04.419> out<00:02:04.539> before<00:02:05.139> me<00:02:05.319> and<00:02:05.499> then

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
and spread them out before me and then

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.350 
and spread them out before me and then
the<00:02:06.219> ones<00:02:06.459> in<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:07.090> middle<00:02:07.359> I'm<00:02:07.959> going<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.360> bend

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the ones in the middle I'm going to bend

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.210 
the ones in the middle I'm going to bend
a<00:02:10.720> 90<00:02:11.290> degree<00:02:11.860> angles<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.590> opposite

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
a 90 degree angles in the opposite

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.350 
a 90 degree angles in the opposite
directions

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
directions

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.480 
directions
and<00:02:18.270> pinch<00:02:19.270> them<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.050> they<00:02:20.230> stay<00:02:20.620> all

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
and pinch them just so they stay all

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.950 
and pinch them just so they stay all
right<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.930> they<00:02:23.050> look<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:25.540> I'm

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
right so they look like this now I'm

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.010 
right so they look like this now I'm
going<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.830> take<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:27.850> closest<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.510> me<00:02:28.750> and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
going to take the one closest to me and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.870 
going to take the one closest to me and
bend<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.680> will<00:02:32.950> get<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
bend it like so this will get you the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.400 
bend it like so this will get you the
start<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.950> your<00:02:37.140> beehive

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
start of your beehive

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.460 
start of your beehive
so<00:02:39.220> now<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.490> I've<00:02:39.670> bent<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.840> I'm

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
so now that I've bent it like that I'm

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.520 
so now that I've bent it like that I'm
going<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.610> bend<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:44.230> one<00:02:44.470> next<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:46.980> so

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
going to bend the one next to it like so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.230 
going to bend the one next to it like so
so<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.680> one<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.010> right<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.700> then

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
so the one to the right of it and then

so the one to the right of it and then
I'm<00:02:52.390> going<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.750> bend<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.830> one<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.280> right

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
I'm going to bend the one to the right

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.680 
I'm going to bend the one to the right
of<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.520> on<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.760> now<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.300> get<00:03:01.360> to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
of that and so on so now that I get to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.890 
of that and so on so now that I get to
this<00:03:01.840> one<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.830> number<00:03:03.190> four<00:03:03.900> I'm

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
this one so this was number four I'm

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.960 
this one so this was number four I'm
going<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.680> tuck<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.820> one<00:03:07.620> into<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.250> original

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.730 

loop<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.810> don't<00:03:16.870> want<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.440> twist

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
loop like that so I don't want to twist

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.949 
loop like that so I don't want to twist
so<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.100> got<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> be<00:03:18.490> careful<00:03:19.980> all<00:03:20.980> right<00:03:21.250> and

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
so you got to be careful all right and

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.100 
so you got to be careful all right and
so<00:03:22.959> now<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:24.220> square<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.850> if<00:03:28.360> this<00:03:28.870> was

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
so now I have a square so if this was

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.380 
so now I have a square so if this was
one<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.739> was<00:03:29.950> -<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.430> was<00:03:30.610> three<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.180> this

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
one this was - this was three and this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.150 
one this was - this was three and this
was<00:03:31.570> four<00:03:32.250> four<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.610> going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.269> be<00:03:34.570> my<00:03:35.110> new<00:03:35.470> one

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
was four four is going to be my new one

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.220 
was four four is going to be my new one
and<00:03:36.580> I'm<00:03:37.269> going<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.870> bend<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.890> over<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:40.660> itself

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
and I'm going to bend it over on itself

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.470 
and I'm going to bend it over on itself
and<00:03:42.660> we<00:03:43.660> are<00:03:43.750> going<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:47.340> bend<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.880> one<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
and we are going to bend the one to the

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
and we are going to bend the one to the
right<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.430> then<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:52.630> hole<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.019> this

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
right of it and then this hole so this

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.600 
right of it and then this hole so this
was<00:03:53.739> 1<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.360> 2<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.489> 3<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:59.070> is<00:04:00.070> 4

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
was 1 this is 2 this is 3 and this is 4

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.140 
was 1 this is 2 this is 3 and this is 4
and<00:04:00.970> we<00:04:01.390> tuck<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.959> fourth<00:04:02.290> one<00:04:02.590> in<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.280> loop

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and we tuck the fourth one in and loop

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.870 
and we tuck the fourth one in and loop
and<00:04:04.450> I'm<00:04:05.410> not<00:04:05.680> even<00:04:05.860> going<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.190> let<00:04:06.310> go<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.730> this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
and I'm not even going to let go of this

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.050 
and I'm not even going to let go of this
one<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.540> I'm<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.430> immediately<00:04:09.430> go<00:04:09.730> over

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
one so I'm going to immediately go over

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.320 
one so I'm going to immediately go over
and<00:04:10.300> that's<00:04:10.570> going<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.870> be<00:04:10.989> my<00:04:11.170> 1<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.330> then

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
and that's going to be my 1 and then

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.890 
and that's going to be my 1 and then
we're<00:04:13.510> going<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.810> do<00:04:14.110> 2<00:04:15.060> 3<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:17.760> my<00:04:18.760> fourth<00:04:19.239> is

now<00:05:42.530> of<00:05:42.680> course<00:05:42.740> when<00:05:43.130> you<00:05:43.250> do<00:05:43.430> something<00:05:43.729> like

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
now of course when you do something like

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.950 
now of course when you do something like
this<00:05:44.600> it<00:05:45.500> will<00:05:46.400> how<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.300> looks<00:05:47.540> in<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.810> end

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
this it will how it looks in the end

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.490 
this it will how it looks in the end
will<00:05:48.290> depend<00:05:48.830> on<00:05:49.190> how<00:05:50.150> tightly<00:05:50.630> you<00:05:50.840> weave<00:05:51.260> it

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
will depend on how tightly you weave it

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.250 
will depend on how tightly you weave it
now<00:05:52.310> I'm<00:05:52.520> not<00:05:52.760> doing<00:05:53.090> it<00:05:53.210> as<00:05:53.330> tight<00:05:53.660> as<00:05:53.690> I<00:05:53.990> can

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
now I'm not doing it as tight as I can

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.080 
now I'm not doing it as tight as I can
but<00:05:54.620> I<00:05:54.680> could<00:05:54.889> definitely<00:05:55.010> have<00:05:55.460> it<00:05:55.639> looser

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.300 
and a looser we will get you something
like<00:06:00.740> this

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
like this

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.520 
like this
or<00:06:01.639> as<00:06:01.820> I<00:06:01.940> think<00:06:02.180> this<00:06:02.479> one<00:06:02.750> will<00:06:02.990> be<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.229> little

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
or as I think this one will be a little

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.890 
or as I think this one will be a little
tighter<00:06:07.120> and<00:06:08.979> will<00:06:09.979> be<00:06:10.130> a<00:06:10.160> little<00:06:10.460> stubby

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
tighter and will be a little stubby

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.270 
tighter and will be a little stubby
which<00:06:11.900> is<00:06:12.050> perfectly<00:06:12.410> fine<00:06:12.500> depending<00:06:13.040> on

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
which is perfectly fine depending on

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.460 
which is perfectly fine depending on
what<00:06:13.460> kind<00:06:13.580> of<00:06:13.700> arrangement<00:06:14.270> you're<00:06:14.479> going

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
what kind of arrangement you're going

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:38.270 
what kind of arrangement you're going
for

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.890 

see<00:06:39.280> it's<00:06:39.550> definitely<00:06:39.759> a<00:06:40.090> little<00:06:40.300> shorter

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
see it's definitely a little shorter

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.119 
see it's definitely a little shorter
than<00:06:40.930> my<00:06:41.349> I<00:06:42.009> original<00:06:42.909> and<00:06:43.710> that's<00:06:44.710> probably

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
than my I original and that's probably

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:47.909 
than my I original and that's probably
what<00:06:45.550> you<00:06:46.270> should<00:06:46.509> aim<00:06:46.930> for<00:06:47.259> with<00:06:47.469> your<00:06:47.650> first

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
what you should aim for with your first

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.309 
what you should aim for with your first
one<00:06:48.250> just<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:48.669> you<00:06:48.699> can<00:06:48.939> get<00:06:49.210> a<00:06:49.270> good<00:06:49.780> handling

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 
one just so you can get a good handling

00:06:50.319 --> 00:07:04.350 
one just so you can get a good handling
of<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:51.750> process<00:07:01.979> all<00:07:02.979> right<00:07:03.370> now<00:07:03.610> I'm<00:07:03.879> fine

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
of the process all right now I'm fine

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.890 
of the process all right now I'm fine
with<00:07:04.629> that<00:07:04.659> being<00:07:05.110> with<00:07:05.800> the<00:07:06.610> way<00:07:06.729> it<00:07:06.879> is<00:07:07.090> so

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
with that being with the way it is so

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.390 
with that being with the way it is so
now<00:07:08.050> I'm<00:07:08.259> going<00:07:08.560> to<00:07:08.650> bring<00:07:08.949> my<00:07:10.650> four<00:07:11.650> together

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
now I'm going to bring my four together

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.899 
now I'm going to bring my four together
and<00:07:13.030> I<00:07:13.750> like<00:07:13.930> to<00:07:14.139> pick<00:07:14.409> the<00:07:14.740> longest<00:07:15.219> one<00:07:15.550> and

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 
and I like to pick the longest one and

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.649 
and I like to pick the longest one and
kind<00:07:16.690> of<00:07:16.840> wrap<00:07:17.500> it<00:07:17.530> you<00:07:18.039> can<00:07:18.190> maybe<00:07:18.280> make<00:07:18.520> a

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659 
kind of wrap it you can maybe make a

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:23.580 
kind of wrap it you can maybe make a
90-degree<00:07:19.659> angle<00:07:20.039> so<00:07:21.039> wrap<00:07:21.400> it<00:07:21.430> once<00:07:22.330> and<00:07:22.870> then

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
90-degree angle so wrap it once and then

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:35.670 
90-degree angle so wrap it once and then
come<00:07:24.280> under<00:07:28.409> and<00:07:29.789> there<00:07:30.789> you<00:07:30.969> go<00:07:34.020> you<00:07:35.020> can<00:07:35.050> pull

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
come under and there you go you can pull

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.369 
come under and there you go you can pull
them<00:07:35.889> up<00:07:36.099> so<00:07:36.400> that<00:07:36.430> they're<00:07:36.849> as<00:07:37.599> tight<00:07:38.080> as<00:07:38.349> you

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:38.379 
them up so that they're as tight as you

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:43.920 
them up so that they're as tight as you
want<00:07:38.860> them<00:07:39.729> to<00:07:39.940> be<00:07:40.409> and<00:07:42.360> there<00:07:43.360> you<00:07:43.539> have<00:07:43.569> it

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
want them to be and there you have it

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.680 
want them to be and there you have it
and<00:07:44.169> then<00:07:44.889> of<00:07:45.009> course<00:07:45.069> you<00:07:45.550> can<00:07:45.789> trim<00:07:46.120> these<00:07:46.300> to

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
and then of course you can trim these to

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:57.990 
and then of course you can trim these to
be<00:07:46.900> what<00:07:47.560> you<00:07:47.710> want<00:07:48.150> aesthetically<00:07:56.430> and<00:07:57.430> so
