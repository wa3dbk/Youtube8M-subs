00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
an l5r spin-off a lot of people really

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.480 
an l5r spin-off a lot of people really
liked<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.390> had<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.950> depleting<00:01:49.950> resource

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
liked that it had a depleting resource

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
liked that it had a depleting resource
system<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.299> were<00:01:51.420> sort<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> timer

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
idea was that over there 15 years they

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
idea was that over there 15 years they
had<00:02:23.940> no<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.480> their<00:02:24.630> story<00:02:24.870> team<00:02:25.050> saying<00:02:25.320> no

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
to come up with happened so you have

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.860 
to come up with happened so you have
cars<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.850> Dec<00:02:30.090> such<00:02:30.300> as<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.810> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the I won't get into showing how the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.630 
the I won't get into showing how the
whole<00:03:01.290> game<00:03:01.440> plays<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.830> now<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.340> is

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
whole game plays right now because it is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.729 
whole game plays right now because it is
it<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.150> based<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.480> ccg<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.410> got<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
it is based on ccg so it's kind of got a

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.590 
it is based on ccg so it's kind of got a
slightly<00:03:05.220> more<00:03:05.459> complicated<00:03:05.760> rule<00:03:06.090> set<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.540> we

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
slightly more complicated rule set it we

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.280 
slightly more complicated rule set it we
did<00:03:06.900> tone<00:03:07.230> back<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:09.090> original<00:03:09.270> lbs<00:03:09.840> rules<00:03:10.050> set

did tone back the original lbs rules set

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.720 
did tone back the original lbs rules set
down<00:03:10.320> got<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> few<00:03:11.070> rid<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.459> few<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.670> the
