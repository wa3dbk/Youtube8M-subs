not a gameplay this is gonna be my speed
test<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> am<00:00:17.970> running<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.359> Wi-Fi<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.140> I

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
test because I am running on Wi-Fi and I

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.259 
test because I am running on Wi-Fi and I
did<00:00:19.949> some<00:00:20.160> things<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.640> my<00:00:20.760> router<00:00:20.990> which<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:23.269> set

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
did some things to my router which I set

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.750 
did some things to my router which I set
off<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:25.019> passcode<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> don't<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> pass

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
off a passcode so you don't need a pass

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660 
off a passcode so you don't need a pass
code<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.119> login<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
code to login I know that's kind of

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.580 
code to login I know that's kind of
crazy<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.119> most<00:00:30.480> people<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.410> have

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
crazy because most people like do have

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
crazy because most people like do have
pass<00:00:31.830> codes<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.489> passwords<00:00:33.210> whatever<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.350> your

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
pass codes or passwords whatever so your

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000 
pass codes or passwords whatever so your
neighbors<00:00:34.950> won't<00:00:35.340> log<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:37.890> your

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
neighbors won't log on to your to your

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.819 
neighbors won't log on to your to your
router<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.520> use<00:00:39.090> basically<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.800> just

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
router and use basically you know just

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.830 
router and use basically you know just
use<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.210> um<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> net<00:00:44.129> gear<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
use it so um I do have a net gear and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
use it so um I do have a net gear and
with<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.309> password<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
with that if I don't have it password I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.990 
with that if I don't have it password I
can't<00:00:48.360> set<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:48.890> access<00:00:49.890> point<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> which

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
can't set an access point on it which

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.369 
can't set an access point on it which
basically<00:00:51.239> means<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.579> set<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:54.379> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
basically means that you can set a you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.720 
basically means that you can set a you
know<00:00:55.500> um<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.780> could<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.550> you

know um you could have it you like you
could<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> set<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> people<00:01:01.320> who<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
could have it set to the people who you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.860 
could have it set to the people who you
want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.100> log<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.699> your<00:01:02.820> thing<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
do have access access point or X

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
do have access access point or X
something<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.229> forgot<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.710> called<00:01:07.890> I'm

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
something I forgot it was called I'm

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.859 
something I forgot it was called I'm
pretty<00:01:08.250> sure<00:01:08.310> those<00:01:08.430> access<00:01:08.729> point<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.780> if

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
pretty sure those access point but if

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.580 
pretty sure those access point but if
you<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> set<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:12.479> enabled<00:01:13.110> only

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you do have it set like enabled only

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.960 
you do have it set like enabled only
those<00:01:14.460> devices<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
those devices that you that you want to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.410 
those devices that you that you want to
have<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.240> network<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:20.430> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
have on your network can be on it and so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.289 
have on your network can be on it and so
your<00:01:22.290> neighbors<00:01:22.710> might<00:01:22.920> think<00:01:22.950> oh<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
your neighbors might think oh this

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
your neighbors might think oh this
person<00:01:24.810> does<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.560> password<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
person does I have a password on it so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
person does I have a password on it so
when<00:01:27.060> they<00:01:27.150> try<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> log<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.560> can't

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
when they try to log on if they can't

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.310 
when they try to log on if they can't
because<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.400> don't<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.970> authority<00:01:30.320> so

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
because they don't have the authority so

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
because they don't have the authority so
that's<00:01:31.560> pretty<00:01:31.740> cool<00:01:31.920> about<00:01:32.040> Nike<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.549> guess<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that's pretty cool about Nike I guess I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.280 
that's pretty cool about Nike I guess I
am<00:01:34.049> running<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.640> wireless<00:01:35.640> n<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
am running a wireless n so I think it's

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.480 
am running a wireless n so I think it's
300<00:01:40.290> megabytes<00:01:41.250> per<00:01:41.909> second<00:01:43.130> I'm<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.310> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
300 megabytes per second I'm not really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.319 
300 megabytes per second I'm not really
good<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.570> mean<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.549> did

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
good at this but I mean I get I did

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.260 
good at this but I mean I get I did
upgrade<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.090> decent<00:01:51.090> amount

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
upgrade so I do get like a decent amount

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
upgrade so I do get like a decent amount
of<00:01:51.450> speeds<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.049> phone<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:53.520> already<00:01:53.909> know

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
of speeds on my phone and I already know

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.420 
of speeds on my phone and I already know
just<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.509> around<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> house<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.100> mean<00:01:56.280> my

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just like around the house so I mean my

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.959 
just like around the house so I mean my
house<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.119> big<00:01:57.329> anyways<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.590> um

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
house is not that big anyways so um

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.459 
house is not that big anyways so um
let's<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.360> started<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.070> we<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
let's get this started so we go to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
let's get this started so we go to
settings<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:04.770> down<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.020> network<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> can

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
settings go down to network as you can

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.480 
settings go down to network as you can
see<00:02:10.229> here

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
see here

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.080 
see here
I<00:02:12.520> have<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.210> have<00:02:13.510> 100%<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.620> only<00:02:15.610> have<00:02:15.820> one

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I have I do have 100% I only have one

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.120 
I have I do have 100% I only have one
primary<00:02:16.540> DNS<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:19.300> just<00:02:19.540> random<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.440> let's<00:02:20.860> go

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
primary DNS it's just random so let's go

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.300 
primary DNS it's just random so let's go
down<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.870> internet<00:02:22.870> connection<00:02:23.320> test<00:02:23.590> right

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
down to internet connection test right

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.670 
down to internet connection test right
now<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:25.390> pretty<00:02:26.610> no<00:02:27.610> hope<00:02:27.820> it's<00:02:28.060> 135<00:02:28.720> so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
now it's it's pretty no hope it's 135 so

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.940 
now it's it's pretty no hope it's 135 so
I<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:30.490> hope<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:32.080> know<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.350> internet<00:02:32.680> speeds
