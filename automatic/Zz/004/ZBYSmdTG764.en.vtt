00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
it's me Dave from the code when I got

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.039 
it's me Dave from the code when I got
another<00:00:02.520> quick<00:00:02.790> tutorial<00:00:02.939> for<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.629> let<00:00:03.959> me

another quick tutorial for you let me
show<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.350> set<00:00:04.589> up<00:00:04.620> your<00:00:04.710> ME<00:00:05.130> system<00:00:05.580> to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
show you how to set up your ME system to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.509 
show you how to set up your ME system to
do<00:00:06.029> your<00:00:06.180> automated<00:00:06.569> be<00:00:06.930> breeding<00:00:07.560> in<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
do your automated be breeding in the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.919 
do your automated be breeding in the
past<00:00:08.730> I'd<00:00:08.940> shown<00:00:09.150> how<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.330> use<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.719> build

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
past I'd shown how to use the build

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.110 
past I'd shown how to use the build
craft<00:00:10.230> pipes<00:00:10.500> along<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:11.010> SmartArt<00:00:11.490> gates<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
craft pipes along with SmartArt gates to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.299 
craft pipes along with SmartArt gates to
set<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> ME<00:00:13.590> system<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
set this up with the ME system it's a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
set this up with the ME system it's a
little<00:00:14.460> bit<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> little<00:00:15.210> bit<00:00:15.420> easier<00:00:15.719> not

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
little bit a little bit easier not

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.920 
little bit a little bit easier not
entirely<00:00:16.770> expensive<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.640> much<00:00:18.630> more

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
entirely expensive and much more

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
entirely expensive and much more
efficient<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.640> first<00:00:20.820> thing<00:00:20.970> you're

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
efficient so the first thing you're

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.179 
efficient so the first thing you're
going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.270> need<00:00:21.420> obviously<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.140> your<00:00:22.470> apiary

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
going to need obviously is your apiary

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.429 
going to need obviously is your apiary
it's<00:00:23.640> gonna<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.910> able<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.150> set<00:00:24.359> down<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.840> have

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it's gonna be able to be set down I have

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470 
it's gonna be able to be set down I have
some<00:00:25.650> oblivion<00:00:26.160> frames<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.029> kill<00:00:27.330> off

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
some oblivion frames just to kill off

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660 
some oblivion frames just to kill off
the<00:00:27.660> bees<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.170> quickly<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.590> possible<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the bees as quickly as possible so that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.569 
the bees as quickly as possible so that
I<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.910> test<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.099> what<00:00:32.099> you're<00:00:32.219> gonna<00:00:32.340> need

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
I can test it and what you're gonna need

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.549 
I can test it and what you're gonna need
is<00:00:32.640> after<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.450> your<00:00:33.540> ME<00:00:33.750> system<00:00:34.260> set<00:00:34.530> up

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
is after you have your ME system set up

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.100 
is after you have your ME system set up
you're<00:00:35.520> gonna<00:00:35.640> need<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.390> called<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you're gonna need what is called the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.270 
you're gonna need what is called the
fuzzy<00:00:37.710> export<00:00:38.370> bus<00:00:39.320> which<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> basic<00:00:40.860> export

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
fuzzy export bus which is a basic export

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.389 
fuzzy export bus which is a basic export
bus<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:41.850> advanced<00:00:42.120> processor<00:00:43.250> I'm<00:00:44.250> gonna

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
bus with an advanced processor I'm gonna

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.580 
bus with an advanced processor I'm gonna
put<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> top<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.110> pointing<00:00:46.469> down

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
put this on the top to be pointing down

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.860 
put this on the top to be pointing down
into<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.969> you're<00:00:48.090> gonna<00:00:48.180> need<00:00:48.450> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
into it and then you're gonna need a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.830 
into it and then you're gonna need a
basic<00:00:49.739> import<00:00:50.309> bus<00:00:51.110> that's<00:00:52.110> basic<00:00:52.590> import<00:00:52.980> bus

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
basic import bus that's basic import bus

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
basic import bus that's basic import bus
and<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.960> we're<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> back<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and this we're gonna put on the back the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
and this we're gonna put on the back the
positioning<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> these<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.469> altered<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
positioning of these can be altered you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.170 
positioning of these can be altered you
can<00:00:59.070> mess<00:00:59.219> around<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.000> works

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
can mess around that to see what works

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
can mess around that to see what works
best<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.859> way<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
best for your system this is the way I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
best for your system this is the way I
went<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.910> basically<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
went with of this one basically the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.450 
went with of this one basically the
import<00:01:04.350> bus<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.619> gonna<00:01:04.769> pull<00:01:04.979> anything<00:01:05.220> out

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
import bus is gonna pull anything out

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
import bus is gonna pull anything out
that<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.180> inside<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.350> area<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.799> here
