count<00:01:39.450> how<00:01:39.750> many<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:41.040> you're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
count how many you have and then you're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.380 
count how many you have and then you're
going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> go<00:01:41.430> back<00:01:41.549> into<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> computer<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
going to go back into the computer and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
going to go back into the computer and
you're<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> run<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.110> plu<00:01:43.619> report<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> P

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you're going to run a plu report or a P

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.330 
you're going to run a plu report or a P
mix<00:01:45.270> report<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.890> many<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> those

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
mix report to see how many of those

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399 
mix report to see how many of those
items<00:01:47.790> sold<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.509> previous<00:01:48.930> shift<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
items sold the previous shift or the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.200 
items sold the previous shift or the
previous<00:01:49.829> day<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.909> you're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
previous day and then you're going to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.990 
previous day and then you're going to
calculate<00:01:51.810> an<00:01:52.049> ideal<00:01:52.619> inventory<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> we're

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
calculate an ideal inventory and we're

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520 
calculate an ideal inventory and we're
going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.299> into<00:01:54.509> an<00:01:54.600> example<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.320> but

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
going to go into an example of this but

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
going to go into an example of this but
really<00:01:55.710> you'll<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.850> able<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> track<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
really you'll be able to track a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.929 
really you'll be able to track a
variance<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.619> how<00:01:58.979> many<00:01:59.310> am<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.700> missing

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
variance and see how many am I missing

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.139 
variance and see how many am I missing
am<00:02:00.329> i<00:02:00.930> accurate<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.710> they're<00:02:02.340> missing<00:02:02.490> where

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
am i accurate if they're missing where

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.090 
am i accurate if they're missing where
did<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> waist<00:02:04.799> log

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
did they go are they on the waist log

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.280 
did they go are they on the waist log
that's<00:02:05.939> great<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.420> they're<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> waist<00:02:06.990> log

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that's great if they're on the waist log

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.350 
that's great if they're on the waist log
then<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:07.860> hey<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.429> cook<00:02:08.610> overcooked<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
then we know hey the cook overcooked it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.750 
then we know hey the cook overcooked it
well<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.110> fine<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:10.920> ideal<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.430> then

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
well that's fine it's not ideal but then

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.790 
well that's fine it's not ideal but then
we<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.030> at<00:02:12.150> least<00:02:12.180> adjust<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.230> train

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
we can at least adjust we can train

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
we can at least adjust we can train
because<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.190> know<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.610> I'm<00:02:14.760> short<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.360> stake

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
because we know that I'm short one stake

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.780 
because we know that I'm short one stake
it<00:02:15.960> went<00:02:16.620> into<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.830> trash<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.670> got

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it went into the trash because it got

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.690 
it went into the trash because it got
overcooked<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.600> I've<00:02:19.530> got<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.920> comp<00:02:20.160> for<00:02:20.490> it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
overcooked and I've got the comp for it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.640 
overcooked and I've got the comp for it
but<00:02:21.210> what<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.480> will<00:02:21.660> also<00:02:21.960> do<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.560> will

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
but what this will also do is it will

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.080 
but what this will also do is it will
let<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.950> find<00:02:23.190> out<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.700> cooks<00:02:23.910> are

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
let you find out if your cooks are

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.060 
let you find out if your cooks are

stealing your steaks you're going to be

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
stealing your steaks you're going to be
able<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.620> know<00:02:28.770> exactly<00:02:29.520> where<00:02:29.790> your<00:02:29.970> most

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
your food costs so let's go inside my

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700 
your food costs so let's go inside my
computer<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.090> check<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> sample<00:02:37.500> key

item inventory or key item report looks
like<00:02:40.290> okay<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.490> see<00:02:41.640> you've<00:02:42.180> got

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
like okay so as you can see you've got

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.760 
like okay so as you can see you've got
the<00:02:42.480> date<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.960> then<00:02:43.080> running<00:02:43.320> along<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> top

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
the date and then running along the top

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.430 
the date and then running along the top
you've<00:02:44.100> got<00:02:44.130> opening<00:02:44.670> inventory<00:02:45.440> purchased

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
you've got opening inventory purchased

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.040 
you've got opening inventory purchased
or<00:02:46.620> slash<00:02:46.890> prepared<00:02:47.550> total<00:02:48.420> available<00:02:48.840> and

or slash prepared total available and
then<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.350> new<00:02:49.530> kind<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.980> box<00:02:50.460> or<00:02:50.760> column<00:02:51.240> or

then in a new kind of box or column or

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.140 
then in a new kind of box or column or
category<00:02:51.900> we've<00:02:52.110> got<00:02:52.490> quantity<00:02:53.490> sold<00:02:53.850> or

comped<00:02:54.720> ideal<00:02:55.590> ending<00:02:56.180> ideal<00:02:57.180> or<00:02:57.660> I'm<00:02:57.870> sorry

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
comped ideal ending ideal or I'm sorry

comped ideal ending ideal or I'm sorry
actual<00:02:58.800> ending<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.490> then<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> variance<00:03:00.120> so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
actual ending and then the variance so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.210 
actual ending and then the variance so
basically<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:00.990> let's<00:03:01.590> look<00:03:01.710> at<00:03:01.860> eight<00:03:02.010> ounce

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
basically like let's look at eight ounce

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.880 
basically like let's look at eight ounce
hamburgers<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:03.000> example<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:04.200> start<00:03:04.650> your

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
hamburgers for example if you start your

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.850 
hamburgers for example if you start your
day<00:03:05.130> or<00:03:05.460> your<00:03:05.490> shift<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.210> 34<00:03:06.960> hamburgers<00:03:07.590> and

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
day or your shift with 34 hamburgers and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.120 
day or your shift with 34 hamburgers and
you<00:03:08.640> purchased<00:03:09.120> or<00:03:09.240> prepared<00:03:09.720> 0<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.800> day

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
you purchased or prepared 0 that day

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.660 
you purchased or prepared 0 that day
then<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.880> have<00:03:12.060> 34<00:03:12.870> available<00:03:13.440> for<00:03:13.620> sale<00:03:13.830> now

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
then you have 34 available for sale now

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.160 
then you have 34 available for sale now
at<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> end<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> day<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:15.810> at<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.960> end<00:03:16.050> of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
need to find out where that is now let's

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.180 
need to find out where that is now let's
look<00:03:54.720> at<00:03:54.840> something<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.440> shrimp<00:03:55.980> for

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
look at something like shrimp for

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.610 
look at something like shrimp for
example<00:03:56.610> if<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:57.630> notice<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.110> did<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.470> as

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
example if you notice I did that as

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.699 
example if you notice I did that as
orders<00:03:59.190> so<00:04:00.030> not<00:04:00.450> per<00:04:00.840> shrimp<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.350> makes<00:04:01.560> it

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
orders so not per shrimp this makes it

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.229 
orders so not per shrimp this makes it
easier<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.040> should<00:04:02.310> be<00:04:02.400> portioning<00:04:03.030> your

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
easier you should be portioning your

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.630 
easier you should be portioning your
shrimp<00:04:03.480> into<00:04:03.780> order<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.290> if<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.770> five

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.460 
shrimp into order so if you have five
pieces<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.150> shrimp<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.690> go<00:04:06.810> into<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> pasta

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
pieces of shrimp that go into a pasta

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.710 
pieces of shrimp that go into a pasta
dish<00:04:07.590> they<00:04:07.739> should<00:04:07.920> be<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.160> portion<00:04:08.580> bags<00:04:08.850> with

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
dish they should be in portion bags with

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.940 
dish they should be in portion bags with
the<00:04:09.840> five<00:04:10.080> and<00:04:10.320> then<00:04:10.410> we're<00:04:10.500> going<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.650> count

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
the five and then we're going to count

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.030 
the five and then we're going to count
how<00:04:11.160> many<00:04:11.220> orders<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.510> then<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.230> have<00:04:13.620> an
