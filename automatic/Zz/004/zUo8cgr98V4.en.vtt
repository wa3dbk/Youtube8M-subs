really<00:02:12.360> cute

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
really cute

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.240 
really cute
of<00:02:12.989> course<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> choose<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.069> background

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
of course you can choose the background

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.949 
of course you can choose the background
to<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.670> different<00:02:14.970> color<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.420> could<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.630> pink

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
to be a different color it could be pink

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.290 
to be a different color it could be pink
it<00:02:16.410> could<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.800> green<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:18.030> play

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
it could be green but I think play

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.740 
it could be green but I think play
really<00:02:18.569> looks<00:02:19.050> great<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> fee<00:02:20.010> design

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
really looks great with the fee design

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.880 
really looks great with the fee design
so<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.050> your<00:02:22.140> other<00:02:22.200> hand<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.709> can

so then with your other hand you can

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.190 
so then with your other hand you can
leave<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.280> blue<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.820> plan<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:25.050> draw

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.250 
leave it's blue and plan or you can draw
a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.350> blah<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.920> white<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.310> create<00:02:26.610> clients

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
a little blah so white to create clients

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.140 
a little blah so white to create clients
this<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.470> also<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.070> look<00:02:29.280> great<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.670> it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this is also going to look great and it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
this is also going to look great and it
will<00:02:30.269> be<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.690> difficult<00:02:31.050> as<00:02:31.470> drawing<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
will be as difficult as drawing the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.810 
will be as difficult as drawing the
little<00:02:32.430> bee<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.239> line<00:02:33.959> trail<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:35.519> can<00:02:35.670> see

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
little bee in the line trail you can see

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.520 
little bee in the line trail you can see
on<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> thumb<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.390> drawing<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:36.930> tides<00:02:37.230> just

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
on the thumb I'm drawing more tides just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.840 
on the thumb I'm drawing more tides just
so<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.070> more<00:02:38.190> different<00:02:38.459> from<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
so it's a bit more different from the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.610 
so it's a bit more different from the
other<00:02:39.209> nails

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.360

if it goes well huh if you really want

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.740 
if it goes well huh if you really want

so I'll let me tell you that your other
hand<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.320> most<00:02:59.680> likely<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.130> look<00:03:00.430> better<00:03:03.480> so

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
hand is most likely to look better so

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.440 
hand is most likely to look better so
