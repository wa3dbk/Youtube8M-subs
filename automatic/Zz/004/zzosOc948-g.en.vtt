I think successful athletes probably all

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
I think successful athletes probably all
have<00:00:53.460> something<00:00:53.910> similar<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> they

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
have something similar in them that they

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.209

want to be the best

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.549 
want to be the best
sometimes<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> best<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.719> subjective<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sometimes the best is subjective so I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
sometimes the best is subjective so I
appreciate<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.160> opinion<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.969> might

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
want to see the public admittedly a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.490 
want to see the public admittedly a
little<00:01:01.859> bias<00:01:02.070> um<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.170> something

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
little bias um I think we have something

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
little bias um I think we have something
in<00:01:04.589> us<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> drives<00:01:05.129> us<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.400> keeps<00:01:05.790> us<00:01:05.939> going

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
in us that drives us and keeps us going

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.230 
in us that drives us and keeps us going

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
because at some point the money is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.510 
because at some point the money is
irrelevant<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.200> fame<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.650> irrelevant<00:01:10.950> and

some<00:01:37.049> point<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> practice<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
some point is just a lot of practice if

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.420 
some point is just a lot of practice if
a<00:01:38.520> ball<00:01:38.700> comes<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.600> able<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> take

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
a ball comes to me and I'm able to take

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.679 
a ball comes to me and I'm able to take
the<00:01:41.430> proper<00:01:41.759> touch<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> score<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.479> because

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the proper touch and score it's because

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.819 
the proper touch and score it's because
I've<00:01:42.810> done<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> hundred<00:01:43.229> times<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.740> not

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
I've done it a hundred times it's not

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
I've done it a hundred times it's not
because<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.399> born<00:01:44.700> naturally<00:01:45.360> able<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> do

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
because I was born naturally able to do

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.380 
because I was born naturally able to do
that<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.700> there's<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> little<00:01:47.909> bit<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> mixing

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that so there's a little bit of mixing

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
that so there's a little bit of mixing
both<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.840> opinion<00:01:49.200> okay<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.920> you're<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
both in my opinion okay so you're on the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.090 
both in my opinion okay so you're on the
cusp<00:01:50.549> now<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.479> breaking<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> scoring<00:01:52.799> record

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
cusp now of breaking the scoring record

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.310 
cusp now of breaking the scoring record
for<00:01:53.520> Major<00:01:53.670> League<00:01:53.759> Soccer<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:55.049> grabbing

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
do it many many years ago where it was

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.010 
do it many many years ago where it was
the<00:02:06.210> time<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.600> life

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the time of my life

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
the time of my life
from<00:02:07.200> dirty<00:02:07.439> dancing<00:02:07.500> every<00:02:08.039> song<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.520> great

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
from dirty dancing every song a great

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.059 
from dirty dancing every song a great
song<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.929> made<00:02:10.080> me<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> female<00:02:11.039> lead

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
song but you made me be the female lead

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.290 
song but you made me be the female lead
and<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> thought<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.790> was<00:02:11.879> always<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.120> of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and I thought that was always kind of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
and I thought that was always kind of
odd<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.720> taller<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.319> thought<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.620> was

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
odd some taller I thought it was

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
odd some taller I thought it was
obvious<00:02:14.100> okay<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:15.030> however<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.540> want<00:02:15.690> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
obvious okay what however you want to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.620 
obvious okay what however you want to
slice<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.020> uh<00:02:17.030> since<00:02:18.030> that's<00:02:18.210> off<00:02:18.360> your<00:02:18.510> bucket

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
slice it uh since that's off your bucket

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.900 
slice it uh since that's off your bucket
list<00:02:18.780> where<00:02:19.410> do<00:02:19.500> those<00:02:19.590> other<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.760> on

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
list where do those other two go on

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.900 
list where do those other two go on
there<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.690> almost<00:02:21.900> always<00:02:22.020> targets<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
there was almost always targets for you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.640 
there was almost always targets for you
as<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.480> years<00:02:24.690> went<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.290> started

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
as the years went on and I started

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.730 
as the years went on and I started
accumulating<00:02:25.980> caps<00:02:26.670> yes<00:02:27.480> more<00:02:28.230> recently<00:02:28.650> I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
accumulating caps yes more recently I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.520 
accumulating caps yes more recently I
don't<00:02:29.040> know<00:02:29.130> how<00:02:29.310> feasible<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.420> my<00:02:31.110> goal<00:02:31.320> is

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
don't know how feasible it is my goal is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.080 
don't know how feasible it is my goal is
to<00:02:31.740> play<00:02:31.920> through<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.310> World<00:02:32.490> Cup<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.940> then

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
to play through the World Cup and then

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.870 
to play through the World Cup and then
sort<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.660> see<00:02:33.840> how<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.350> shakes<00:02:34.590> out<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
sort of see how it all shakes out the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.690 
sort of see how it all shakes out the
goal<00:02:36.060> scoring<00:02:36.360> record<00:02:36.980> I'm<00:02:37.980> very<00:02:38.220> proud<00:02:38.460> of

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
goal scoring record I'm very proud of

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.430 
goal scoring record I'm very proud of
and<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.630> think<00:02:40.080> I'll<00:02:40.440> get<00:02:40.590> there<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.930> think

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
and I think I'll get there but I think

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.540 
and I think I'll get there but I think
both<00:02:44.430> records<00:02:45.000> probably<00:02:45.690> speak<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.620> being

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
both records probably speak to being

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.980 
both records probably speak to being
able<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.820> keep<00:02:48.000> producing<00:02:48.240> because<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> don't

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
able to keep producing because you don't

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.180 
able to keep producing because you don't
get<00:02:49.080> called<00:02:49.320> into<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> national<00:02:49.890> team<00:02:49.920> if

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
get called into the national team if

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.530 
get called into the national team if
you're<00:02:50.310> not<00:02:50.430> producing<00:02:50.880> speaking<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you're not producing speaking of the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.790 
you're not producing speaking of the
national<00:02:51.840> team<00:02:51.960> one<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.500> longtime
