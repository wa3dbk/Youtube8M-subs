00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.890 
I'm getting honestly pretty lucky right
now<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:11.030> there<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.300> go<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.450> see<00:04:11.660> him<00:04:11.750> right

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
now so there you go you see him right

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.760 
now so there you go you see him right
there<00:04:11.930> left<00:04:12.830> wing<00:04:13.810> Chicago<00:04:14.810> Stanley<00:04:15.620> Cup

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
there left wing Chicago Stanley Cup

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.560 
there left wing Chicago Stanley Cup
edition<00:04:15.890> that's<00:04:16.250> pretty<00:04:16.460> awesome<00:04:17.859> Hornqvist

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
edition that's pretty awesome Hornqvist

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.830 
edition that's pretty awesome Hornqvist
he's<00:04:20.570> not<00:04:20.750> worth<00:04:20.930> anything<00:04:21.790> nope<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.210> yeah<00:04:23.630> I

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
he's not worth anything nope so yeah I

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.810 
he's not worth anything nope so yeah I
guess<00:04:23.960> that's<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.440> that's<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.280> good<00:04:25.310> pack<00:04:25.610> this

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
guess that's it that's a good pack this

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.510 
guess that's it that's a good pack this
is<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:25.970> decent<00:04:26.270> Jersey<00:04:26.660> this<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.770> also<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.130> decent

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
is a decent Jersey this is also a decent

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.210 
is a decent Jersey this is also a decent
Jersey<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.230> guess<00:04:33.560> I'll<00:04:33.710> open<00:04:33.920> like<00:04:34.190> a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
Jersey and then I guess I'll open like a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.820 
Jersey and then I guess I'll open like a
few<00:04:34.700> premium<00:04:35.360> go<00:04:35.480> Jumbo's<00:04:35.990> or<00:04:36.200> premium<00:04:36.530> gold

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
few premium go Jumbo's or premium gold

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.080 
few premium go Jumbo's or premium gold
packs<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.310> just<00:04:37.520> see<00:04:37.580> what<00:04:37.700> I<00:04:37.730> get<00:04:37.910> out<00:04:38.000> of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
packs and just see what I get out of

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.520 
packs and just see what I get out of
those<00:04:38.620> then<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.650> guess<00:04:39.860> that's<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:41.470> instead<00:04:42.470> of

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
those then I guess that's it instead of

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.960 
those then I guess that's it instead of
five<00:04:42.800> hundred<00:04:43.100> KS<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.460> some<00:04:43.610> like<00:04:43.760> get

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
five hundred KS and some like get

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.340 
five hundred KS and some like get
gaining<00:04:44.420> a<00:04:44.480> little<00:04:44.630> bit<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.900> pucks<00:04:45.110> every

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
gaining a little bit of pucks every

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.210 
gaining a little bit of pucks every
single<00:04:45.560> time<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.830> sell<00:04:46.010> everything<00:04:46.310> uh<00:04:48.220> well

maybe give them all away in the last

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.090 
maybe give them all away in the last
video<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:56.870> if<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.200> guys<00:04:57.350> are<00:04:57.560> staying<00:04:57.830> tuned
