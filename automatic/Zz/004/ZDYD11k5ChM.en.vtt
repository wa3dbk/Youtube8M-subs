00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.890
 in this video of grand theft auto 5 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.319
 online is very teaching to be a gray a 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.769
 gray that is well smoked and well crazy not 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 good this this cliches is something is something 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.309
 weird is not something fun, it 's something 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.590
 funny was very funny to do 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 when I discovered it, it gave me a lot of laughter 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 so that's why I'm uploading it if I do not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
 I would have laughed at his vice was not 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 well chafa not in him nothing but good to me 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.769
 it seems this cliché we must make certain 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.009
 mathematical and physical process maybe for 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.320
 take a meditation process of the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.450
 physical and the numbers and everything that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 I need the clichés because clichés 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 there must be some programming should 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.149
 know computing also a little bit 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.210
 of computing I think it would not come 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.039
 nothing bad really but good and leaving 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 talk about trash to start doing 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.870
 this cliché first what we need 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.820
 it's a plane like this white red or blue 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.149
 whoever it is whether they have it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.010
 bought or stolen or whatever 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 we need a plane this as you see it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 Llama mister fly and it's my average plane 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 personal 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.720
 like a million like that many to sell 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.250
 an airplane or sacchi in rays is not bought 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.190
 an airplane with all these disks to Lyon 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.710
 of money and so obviously we need 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.240
 an airplane anyway if you do not have a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.540
 plane do not worry if they were not bought 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.940
 none because here is here you see this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 this is the titan this plane is 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.840
 completely free and here I am going to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.450
 give the location of the raccoon that in the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.190
 map has brought me as they see no 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 really a reference because they eat 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.820
 it's all gray and there's no reference to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.640
 there everything gray but good can follow 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.080
 the video while they play and while 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.000
 Nation the gray if you do not have an airplane 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.710
 can resort to the titan for certain good 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.270
 the size of my car that good rays 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.500
 how to start this clip what 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.630
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.729
 get on the plane obviously good is the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.039
 first step the second step is to fly the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.619
 plane since we have certain height 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.990
 we can start flying towards the heavens 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.549
 because obviously an airplane can not 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.710
 be suspended in heaven if you have not 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.080
 flown first, not like or how 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.009
 start to suddenly float the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.690
 ground 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.060
 that would be cool has told us that 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.020
 I could just float and you did not have 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.940
 to take flight or nothing but 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.740
 you can not maybe there is some click 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.140
 to do it but I do not know it well 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.660
 I can not tell you that information 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.910
 well they are file do this in the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.230
 city because as there are more things that 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.050
 can do anywhere in the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.490
 mountains and everywhere but in the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.260
 city ​​is cooler not because it looks 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.820
 well it falls and good since we 're 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.800
 too high we must fly in 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.310
 straight lines and the sun but we should 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.110
 maintain an angle of almost 90 degrees in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.640
 the plane we must do the controls 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.770
 lever to control all 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.470
 back so that the plane gets up not 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.630
 should be almost in a straight line towards the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.160
 soil and good since they have more or less 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.290
 height is the only thing that they have to 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.270
 to do is to win the airplane 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.040
 drop the plane and here you must 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.960
 stay as quickly as possible to do 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.370
 this simply move on the lever 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.290
 forward for the monkey to fall into 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.790
 chopped and we're going to apply the cliché of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.710
 one of my previous videos that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.200
 call how to survive any fall 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.870
 deadly there is the video my channel and 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.240
 good to see since we apply that click 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.850
 just see we accept and not no 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.620
 nothing will happen and now that we 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.110
 we stop we should simply fix on 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.240
 the map should not check how 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.640
 on the map is our plane there is no 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.290
 see the symbol of the plane and simply 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.000
 we must go there 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.320
 the plane will not fall so far from 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.380
 where you were going to fall more or 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.850
 less there in the area need a 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.650
 sniper to see him because sometimes 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.780
 it is like half a distance and to see it like that 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.780
 as as liquid because sometimes 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.660
 is floating in the air and see there 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.620
 the plane is completely suspended 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.520
 in the frozen air and I do not know or some 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.230
 another phrase petrified maybe if not 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.420
 is suspended because suspended would you be 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.860
 I was like I was 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.330
 half moving but it's not 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.100
 completely static 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.110
 as you can see there I put some 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.870
 shots so it looks like the plane if 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.150
 it is as animated not if it is solid is 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.050
 the plane is not a mirage the plane is 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.970
 The plane itself is there solid this 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.760
 cliché is very cool because imagine 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.680
 to do it online with a lot of people 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.780
 It means that a lot of people and grabs one 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.660
 plane and you start to throw planes and create 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.540
 you start leaving planes suspended by 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.000
 the whole city and everyone who goes 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.680
 going through there is like what's going on there and 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.900
 it's very fun the game you can 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.050
 scare a lot of people or maybe they turn off 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.860
 your xbox because they get scared as well as your 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.890
 mom also suspended in the air and such 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 Once the disc or break either will not want 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.150
 break the disc and well then that would be 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.550
 all for stiglitz I hope you have them 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.440
 liked grass for watching this video and up 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.600
 next and freeze many planes 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.060
 so there are planes frozen by 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.930
 this other one I would be amazing would be like 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.930
 a magical world
