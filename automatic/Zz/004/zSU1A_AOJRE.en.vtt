have wait just wait for Windows 8 it's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
have wait just wait for Windows 8 it's
just<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.259> around<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> corner<00:02:07.789> you<00:02:08.789> know

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
just right around the corner you know

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.660 
just right around the corner you know
they're<00:02:09.170> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.679> amazing<00:02:11.129> upgrade

for everybody
uh and<00:02:14.130> i<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.330> your<00:02:16.170> i<00:02:16.860> would<00:02:17.280> advise

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
uh and i think that your i would advise

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.980 
uh and i think that your i would advise
you<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.730> wait<00:02:17.910> don't<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.570> much<00:02:18.690> about<00:02:18.810> your

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
you to wait don't know much about your

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.120 
you to wait don't know much about your
background<00:02:19.140> though<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.620> i'd<00:02:19.710> say<00:02:19.830> wait<00:02:19.980> for

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
background though but i'd say wait for

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.700 
background though but i'd say wait for
one<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.490> if<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.680> scenario<00:02:22.680> where

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
one is it if you can a scenario where

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.770 
one is it if you can a scenario where
you<00:02:22.890> couldn't<00:02:23.070> wait<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.090> you're<00:02:24.540> using

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you couldn't wait would be you're using

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750 
you couldn't wait would be you're using
your<00:02:24.960> parents<00:02:25.290> computer<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.460> you're<00:02:26.550> tired

pretty close I mean they're working on

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.480 
pretty close I mean they're working on
the<00:02:35.910> bits<00:02:36.060> right<00:02:36.210> now<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.290> honestly<00:02:37.500> if<00:02:38.280> I

the bits right now and honestly if I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.590 
the bits right now and honestly if I
were<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:40.620> would<00:02:41.100> use<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.940> time<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.240> save

with<00:02:55.950> touch<00:02:56.190> screens<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:57.030> will<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
with touch screens this will be the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.540 
with touch screens this will be the
windows<00:02:58.860> touch<00:02:59.220> experience<00:02:59.580> of<00:03:00.510> all<00:03:00.840> time<00:03:01.550> you

know about it I mean Windows 8 is going
to<00:03:10.020> be<00:03:10.080> an<00:03:10.140> amazing<00:03:10.590> upgrade<00:03:11.010> anyway<00:03:11.420> there<00:03:12.420> is

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
to be an amazing upgrade anyway there is

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.090 
to be an amazing upgrade anyway there is
of<00:03:12.750> course<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.080> bifurcation<00:03:13.500> between<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
of course the bifurcation between the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.950 
of course the bifurcation between the
Metro<00:03:14.370> experience<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> classic<00:03:15.630> arrow

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
Metro experience and the classic arrow

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.180 
Metro experience and the classic arrow
experience<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.560> hopefully<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.920> will<00:03:17.010> not

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
experience and hopefully that will not

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.350 
experience and hopefully that will not
be<00:03:17.340> jarring<00:03:17.610> uh<00:03:19.910> but<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:20.970> think<00:03:21.180> they're<00:03:21.270> doing

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
be jarring uh but I think they're doing

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.150 
be jarring uh but I think they're doing
it<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.600> right<00:03:21.690> way<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.170> would<00:03:22.620> like<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.770> see<00:03:22.950> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
it the right way I would like to see a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.080 
it the right way I would like to see a

capacitive touch screen windows computer
that<00:03:27.090> would<00:03:27.209> be<00:03:27.360> something<00:03:27.540> Oh<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:28.380> dream<00:03:29.130> come

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
that would be something Oh a dream come

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.640 
that would be something Oh a dream come
true<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.780> course<00:03:31.020> I<00:03:31.080> don't<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:31.350> I'd<00:03:31.440> want<00:03:31.470> to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
true of course I don't think I'd want to

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.670 
true of course I don't think I'd want to
interact<00:03:31.860> with<00:03:32.070> touch<00:03:32.820> with<00:03:33.720> arrow<00:03:34.050> I'd<00:03:34.380> want

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
interact with touch with arrow I'd want

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.260 
interact with touch with arrow I'd want
to<00:03:34.770> use<00:03:34.890> largely<00:03:35.220> Metro<00:03:35.640> applications

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
to use largely Metro applications

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.900 
to use largely Metro applications
because<00:03:36.780> Metro<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.620> more<00:03:38.220> designed<00:03:38.580> for<00:03:38.790> that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
because Metro is more designed for that

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.120 
because Metro is more designed for that
