00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.930 
videos now on just easier because if I
fall<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.260> just<00:01:28.410> restart<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.980> game<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
fall I can just restart the game and be

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.790 
fall I can just restart the game and be
done<00:01:30.120> with<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.510> so<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.290> easier<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
done with it so it's much easier that

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.650 
done with it so it's much easier that
way<00:01:31.980> this<00:01:32.490> map<00:01:32.640> took<00:01:32.850> quite<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.120> while<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.510> build

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
way this map took quite a while to build

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.660 
way this map took quite a while to build
it<00:01:34.050> was<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.320> fun<00:01:34.500> idea<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.190> has<00:01:35.400> quite<00:01:35.610> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it was a really fun idea it has quite a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
it was a really fun idea it has quite a
