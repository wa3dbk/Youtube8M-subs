00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.609
 broken display cases blocked by police 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.760
 street embankments scattered slightly 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.570
 scared onlookers like this 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.089
 City of Lyon on November 29 about 3000 people 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.279
 mostly young people from the informals 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.609
 immigrants came to protest 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.859
 against the party of the national throne and here 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 very different people are supporters 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.529
 national front on the same day 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.910
 did he come to eat us their parties 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.000
 you just need to look closely at 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.610
 first secondly to understand if u 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.930
 parties and there are opponents it is not at all 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.320
 protesters on the streets and stereotypes about 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.320
 the party itself 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.630
 creative first national front party 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.270
 far right crazy someone sharing on 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.840
 right and left hopelessly outdated 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.530
 this category is from the cold war era of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.330
 epochs of completely different political realities 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.050
 today there is no right and left 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.449
 the differences 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.060
 they repeat each other in all without 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.250
 exception of the question including because 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.030
 that they are all under the hood rugodara pace 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.280
 whom union 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.250
 genuine watershed today passes 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.800
 differently between patriots of France with one 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.770
 parties and supporters of globalization with 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.210
 other we don't wrong wrong 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.600
 cool we belong to france spirits 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.600
 against the second national front party 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.759
 hate non- french I'm in the party already 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.450
 3 years I have never met 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.880
 national front no racist 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.660
 here I am in front of you and you see I am free 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.630
 I go here 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.030
 nobody threatens me around my friends 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.210
 and I will participate in municipal 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.729
 elections from our party I never 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 met harm to the national front nor 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.320
 single racist 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.110
 no time to lose ep 3 party national 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.330
 front marginal political force but 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.909
 six months ago in the elections the European Parliament 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.670
 this party won a majority vote 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.429
 23 percent for comparison at the desk 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.620
 Socialists voted only 13 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.410
 the percentage of those who go to protest 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.380
 against us on the street do not respect the choice 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.200
 people do not respect the fact that we went around 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.170
 all other parties in the European elections 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.480
 they stand for democracy only then 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.150
 when they themselves win the choice 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.660
 and when they lose, they perform 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.209
 vs 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.810
 I can call these protesters extremely 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.060
 the left 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.790
 because their behavior always comes through 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.340
 to the extreme they cannot protest 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.750
 so as not to hit the glass shops and 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.810
 bus stops 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.650
 so as not to harm other people this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.890
 and there are far left 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.049
 there is a stereotype 4 national front 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.549
 sympathizes with Russia only because 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.860
 does not sympathize with us 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.200
 national front and in particular marinas 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.349
 le pen heirs to the policy of the general 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.329
 charles de goll equilibrium politics 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.760
 one of his speeches marin le pen 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.430
 said that Europe for her is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.319
 space from the atlantic to the ural and those 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.620
 most actually repeated the words 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.140
 General de Gaulle by the efforts of our party 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.930
 france is returning to the international 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.629
 Arena as a natural ally of Russia 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.810
 on a blizzard nature let's axle and finally 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:31.799
 meet 5 national front favors 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.299
 against something they are for something of us 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.909
 trying to convince that identity 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.189
 person can easily change it 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:45.389
 culture revise its history 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:47.489
 challenge it with feelings neglect us 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.609
 they say that the new man does not need either 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.690
 his past is not his name is not his family he 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.299
 The Man from Nowhere 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.849
 but all we say is that man 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.639
 organically connected with his family with 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.519
 with their people with their history with their 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.069
 culture person means part of a big 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.500
 community of the nation with which he shares 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.370
