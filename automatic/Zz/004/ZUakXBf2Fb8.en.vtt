got three three yield I did separate the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
got three three yield I did separate the
 curb<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.310> throwing<00:01:47.640> him

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
out the nest and I found one of them on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
out the nest and I found one of them on
the<00:01:50.220> floor<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.610> was<00:01:50.729> stone-cold<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.479> thought<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the floor it was stone-cold I thought it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.460 
the floor it was stone-cold I thought it
was<00:01:51.899> dead

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
was dead

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
was dead
so<00:01:52.829> that's<00:01:53.009> who<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> bit<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> breathing<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
so that's who a bit of breathing on it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.359 
so that's who a bit of breathing on it
and<00:01:54.780> warming<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.860> realized

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and warming it up it was that realized

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.760 
and warming it up it was that realized
