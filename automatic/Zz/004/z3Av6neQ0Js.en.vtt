receiver<00:03:05.519> is<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.590> that's<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:08.040> box<00:03:09.590> so

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
receiver is there so that's the box so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.910 
receiver is there so that's the box so
this<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.099> receiver<00:03:11.489> very<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.120> small

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
this is the receiver very very small

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.440 
this is the receiver very very small
let's<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.129> what<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> can<00:03:14.549> compare<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
let's see what I can compare this to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.649 
let's see what I can compare this to
okay

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
okay

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.160 
okay
what<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.200> had<00:03:20.360> lying<00:03:21.360> around<00:03:21.510> most<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.959> Ram

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
what I had lying around most this Ram

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.770 
what I had lying around most this Ram
stick<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.680> we'll<00:03:22.829> compare<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.459> as<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.629> can

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
stick so we'll compare that as you can

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.050 
stick so we'll compare that as you can
see<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.049> very<00:03:25.170> very<00:03:25.620> small<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.030> see

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
see it's very very small you can see

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.349 
see it's very very small you can see
right<00:03:27.359> there<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.750> only<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.790> once<00:03:29.790> one

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
right there it's only about once one

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.009 
right there it's only about once one
fifth<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:30.780> size<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.530> half<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.400> width<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
fifth the size and half the width of the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.099 
fifth the size and half the width of the
RAM<00:03:34.170> stick<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:35.099> is<00:03:36.090> pretty<00:03:36.390> damn<00:03:36.569> small

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
RAM stick so that is pretty damn small

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.399 
RAM stick so that is pretty damn small
so<00:03:37.319> here's<00:03:37.739> really<00:03:37.980> receiver<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:39.389> mouse<00:03:39.780> and
