00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.099

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 permanent line so you can 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.040
 buying at the essence stand is a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.360
 his great rival or vice versa the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 very famous leaves extender of paola p v 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 place of the first application and then vi 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 I will talk a little about these products there is 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 nothing I tell you only that they are gods 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.850
 pussies that lengthen the Janus volumes 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 instantly the eyelashes the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 result is this and I leave you with 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.030
 tutorial then I start with the application 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.439
 of the mascara in this case I use 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.040
 water smokey I leave the make up for 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.049
 ever 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.930
 but you can use anyway 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.850
 any mascara of which you are 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.460
 in possession and obviously will go to put 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.000
 on the left side paul api and on the side 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 right 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.299
 I say the fibers of the essence 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.619
 to open to specify the thing here 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.930
 so I go with the common application 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.310
 in the fourth with the common application 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.310
 in mascara 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.170
 ok now that i'm still dry i go to 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.640
 take my little figures like yours 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.689
 brush then I insert the brush 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.170
 and they beat up and started 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:09.590
 you can use the pussy you can either 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.519
 tap that apply them by pulling them in 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.519
 this way 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.170
 in this way and then apply again 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.360
 a layer of mascara in such a way as to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.360
 go and cover the white of the fibers 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.690
 in this way this is the result between 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.440
 the normal eye and the eye with booklets 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.440
 of the essence 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.700
 now I'm going to apply the mascara from 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.390
 this other car where I will then go to 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.900
 put the famous extender of the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.900
 paola p 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:42.670
 now I'm going to take the mascara of 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:52.140
 paola p which is made this way and is 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:52.140
 I'm going to apply it also on the eyelashes 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.680
 so as to go and release precisely 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.829
 the product and I'm going to re apply the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.829
 mascara 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.370
 and this is the result is closed a 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:51.159
 moment and a scale otherwise I will 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:56.719
 dry and this is the result of paola p 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:05:07.580
 vitrum a little bit so from this 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:10.280
 is now p here instead is essence il 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.639
 result as you can see is a lot 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.639
 similar 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:30.710
 and no girls this was mine 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:35.870
 today's brand battle and therefore two 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.500
 really important brands in make up 1 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.070
 for its price 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:48.260
 we said low and the other is for the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:50.570
 very famous brand and the product with the 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.440
 which paola p became famous and dal 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.290
 I think that in the end forever 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.880
 took inspiration then what to say of 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.120
 these two products had two 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.120
 products 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.490
 personally speaking the same that 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.890
 they change only in quantity and in 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.150
 price the amount of the cure then 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:22.990
 here are 1.8 of fibers while in the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:27.050
 scex tender we have 7.8 grams of fiber 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.470
 cane in the packaging when 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.810
 precisely this is a jar with the 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.710
 his pipe cleaner while the vault in the vault 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:40.310
 we have the mascara inside 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.800
 of fibers directly and in the packaging 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.690
 in the kit that also arrives via the network 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.430
 even a small brush together 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.800
 personally promotes them both also 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.880
 if obviously paola p has its cost 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.680
 therefore also here as for the battle 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.800
 of brand and omit and essence that if 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.980
 you have not seen I link you here and us 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.840
 purely your decision because I am there 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:11.120
 I showed the effect the effect is similar 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.370
 the effect is beautiful the effect is there though 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.790
 it is a decision that you must 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.400
 you have to take you on which one to prefer 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:22.220
 on which to buy I promote them 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.000
 both my vote for both is 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:28.550
 certainly above 6 from 7 all 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.130
 8 let's say even if they are not very comfortable 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.870
 because when oil and go to apply 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.940
 you must do it with great caution or al 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.789
 maximum you have to keep your eye ajar 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.350
 so as not to let you go 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.300
 pout in the eye because if they do you 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.110
 the subrette in the eye 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.760
 there is an absurd annoyance for the whole 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.789
 time when the sun wu fibers 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.110
 in the eye and nothing this is what 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.729
 I had to tell you about these two products 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.350
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.240

 similar to these type of mascara with 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.360
 the inside already of the fibers te or with gods 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.300
