00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 problem is that everyone is up here 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.830
 the herdgang a bit of a burg 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.440
 hold everyone stands behind each other 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.200
 well that makes sense because like copies 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.550
 if the board lime you would inactive 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 they would call themselves we would call 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.820
 have to make them inactive well 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.929
 I myself very consciously for this strategy 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.660
 opted for the long term 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.550
 they dare not to jerk the wheel 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 to care about 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.100
 yes to to a shock 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 bring about 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 to become 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.060
 later on the atmosphere can be redone 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 best described on Monday morning 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.470
 be the supporters seem to be there 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 have laid down that psv this season 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.400
 does not play a part in the prices 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 but after the game it was Saturday evening 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.540
 of course there is also something 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.000
 remarkable place for that beer 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.280
 the stands flew through the air 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.470
 I was after a hug session 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 end with it all very remarkable 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.699
 is beautiful beautiful I think a beautiful gesture 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.949
 from the supporters and good gesture from the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.660
 players visit each other and others 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.220
 side you have to remain critical and and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.559
 the may not be a kind of hug cultures 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.770
 arise where you fail it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.990
 team is masked because yes this 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 psv simply does not do that well 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.470
 that must be clear 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
 thursday evening it is europe 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.130
 league-duel at home against FC Groningen 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 moretz on the program 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.780
 PSV can overwinter during a draw 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.039
 enforce in europe 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 yes you are there required to sustain 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.570
 by coming that is correct but yes the question 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.399
 or you or you PSV needed 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.800
 does well with it 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.750
 yes you reach a yes in the last 32 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.009
 that says all my sweet will because then 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 come in the last sixteen but the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.810
 last eight and you'll find a european one 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.030
 top team than likely it is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.789
 very difficult in that tournament 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.569
 what is the solution i know i know 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.800
 neither did it 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.390
 I think you need reinforcement 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.009
 pick up in the winter break 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.319
 but it is very difficult nobody 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.789
 it really seems to know 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.229
 yes the question is also whether this is technical 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.830
 staff what can this way 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.929
 continue 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.789
 you also have to be yes you have to be critical 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.319
 and the analysis dares to make of 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.590
 this technical staff 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.970
 bring the fire into this group of players 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 if that is what it is that there is not 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.759
 they didn't turn out and I think so 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.759
 bubbles
