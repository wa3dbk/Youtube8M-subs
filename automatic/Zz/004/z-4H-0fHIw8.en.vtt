difficulty<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.910> be<00:00:11.940> done<00:00:12.349> we've<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:14.420> two

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
difficulty can be done we've got is two

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.849 
difficulty can be done we've got is two
bolts<00:00:15.839> here<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.400> once<00:00:17.609> there<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> whole<00:00:19.590> box

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
bolts here and once there the whole box

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:37.630 
bolts here and once there the whole box
will<00:00:20.130> come<00:00:20.930> move<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> few

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
will come move but there are a few

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.150 
will come move but there are a few
retaining<00:00:38.640> screws<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:41.040> all

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
retaining screws as well so they all

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
retaining screws as well so they all
need<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.460> come<00:00:41.640> off<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.930> lid<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.379> come

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
need to come off then this lid can come

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.569 
need to come off then this lid can come
off<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:44.940> you'll<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.149> access<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
off and then you'll have access to the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.299 
off and then you'll have access to the
mass<00:00:47.579> airflow<00:00:47.820> meter<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.200> F<00:00:49.469> over<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
mass airflow meter and the F over so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
mass airflow meter and the F over so
we'll<00:00:50.430> crack<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:50.879> taking<00:00:51.390> those<00:00:51.480> screws

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
we'll crack on with taking those screws

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.479 
we'll crack on with taking those screws
out<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.530> show<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.739> inside<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.430> box

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
out and I will show you inside this box

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
out and I will show you inside this box
okay<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.550> we've<00:00:56.879> removed<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.360> Jubilee<00:00:57.780> clip

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
okay so we've removed the Jubilee clip

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.110 
okay so we've removed the Jubilee clip
and<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> closer<00:00:59.370> look<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> Jubilee

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and have a closer look at the Jubilee

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.220 
and have a closer look at the Jubilee
clip<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.930> exactly<00:01:01.020> sure

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
clip here if you're not exactly sure

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
clip here if you're not exactly sure
what<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:02.430> basically<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what it is it's basically just a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
what it is it's basically just a
squirrel<00:01:03.510> which<00:01:03.690> tightens<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:05.640> tube<00:01:06.000> up

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
squirrel which tightens this tube up

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
squirrel which tightens this tube up
here<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> connect<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.430> part<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
here but you connect to this part of the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
here but you connect to this part of the
map<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> mass<00:01:10.200> airflow<00:01:10.470> meter

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
map now this is the mass airflow meter

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.620 
map now this is the mass airflow meter
on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> BMW<00:01:12.439> as<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> electronic<00:01:14.630> wiring

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
on the BMW as the electronic wiring

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
on the BMW as the electronic wiring
going<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.280> engine<00:01:17.400> ECU<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
going into the the engine ECU this is

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.620 
going into the the engine ECU this is
the<00:01:20.580> airflow<00:01:21.140> meter<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.470> measures<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the airflow meter which measures the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.679 
the airflow meter which measures the
engine<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> measures<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.450> airflow<00:01:27.450> coming

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
engine so it measures the airflow coming

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.679 
engine so it measures the airflow coming
through<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> air<00:01:28.200> fella<00:01:29.119> into<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> section

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
through the air fella into this section

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
through the air fella into this section
here<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> ultimately<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> engine<00:01:34.729> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
here and ultimately into the engine and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.649 
here and ultimately into the engine and
it's<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.329> point<00:01:38.060> which<00:01:39.060> measures<00:01:39.450> how

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it's at this point which measures how

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
it's at this point which measures how
much<00:01:40.140> engine<00:01:40.530> show<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> how<00:01:41.280> much<00:01:41.369> air<00:01:41.579> needs

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
much engine show you how much air needs

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420 
much engine show you how much air needs
to<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> engine<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.920> mix<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
to go into the engine to mix with the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.090 
to go into the engine to mix with the
fuel<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> engine<00:01:45.750> running

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
fuel to get the engine running

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
fuel to get the engine running
efficiently<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> after<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> airbox<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
efficiently so after the airbox on the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.100 
efficiently so after the airbox on the
mass<00:01:52.170> air<00:01:52.380> flow<00:01:52.409> meter<00:01:52.740> separated<00:01:54.110> pretty

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
mass air flow meter separated pretty

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.400 
mass air flow meter separated pretty
easy<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:56.700> long<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.119> how<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.450> it

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.390 

okay<00:02:01.550> so<00:02:02.550> we've<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.730> removed<00:02:03.830> six<00:02:04.830> screws

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
okay so we've just removed six screws

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.900 
okay so we've just removed six screws
from<00:02:06.180> underneath<00:02:06.510> here<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.429> gain<00:02:08.429> access<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
from underneath here to gain access to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.860 
from underneath here to gain access to
the<00:02:09.210> airflow<00:02:09.600> meter<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:11.120> air<00:02:12.120> filter<00:02:12.510> now

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the airflow meter on the air filter now

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.650 
the airflow meter on the air filter now
these<00:02:13.020> are<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.290> screws<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:14.300> it's<00:02:15.300> best<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
these are the screws here it's best to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.699 
these are the screws here it's best to
use<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:17.120> stubby<00:02:18.120> screwdriver<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:19.440> short

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
use a stubby screwdriver really short

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.940 
use a stubby screwdriver really short
one<00:02:20.990> because<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.110> do<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.530> haven't<00:02:22.770> got<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> lot

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
one because you do you haven't got a lot

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.980 
one because you do you haven't got a lot
of<00:02:23.010> Spears<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.490> work<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:23.790> under<00:02:24.000> here<00:02:24.270> but

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
of Spears to work with under here but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.760 
of Spears to work with under here but
anyway<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.470> goes<00:02:27.709> its<00:02:28.709> lid<00:02:29.959> color<00:02:30.959> should

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
anyway here goes its lid color should

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:44.449 
anyway here goes its lid color should
just<00:02:31.950> come<00:02:32.160> off<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:43.380> doesn't<00:02:43.590> seem<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.250> come

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
just come off it doesn't seem to be come

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.810 
just come off it doesn't seem to be come
on

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
on

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.020 
on
that's<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.890> I'm<00:02:50.010> doing<00:02:50.040> right

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that's because what I'm doing right

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.900 
that's because what I'm doing right
there<00:02:51.360> I've<00:02:52.170> left<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> screws<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:55.380> so

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
there I've left one of the screws in so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:34.420 
there I've left one of the screws in so
I<00:02:56.910> need<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.209> get<00:02:57.300> that

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.330 

okay<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.390> um<00:03:36.810> again<00:03:36.930> there<00:03:37.470> are<00:03:37.620> five<00:03:37.860> seven

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
okay so um again there are five seven

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.199
