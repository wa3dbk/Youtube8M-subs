that there isn't anything I mean you're

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.470 
that there isn't anything I mean you're
a<00:02:39.200> human<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.829> you<00:02:40.010> can<00:02:40.220> see<00:02:40.519> for<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:40.970> hundred

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
a human it you can see for a hundred

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.509 
a human it you can see for a hundred
yards<00:02:41.959> tops<00:02:42.730> how<00:02:43.730> could<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.150> possibly<00:02:44.630> know

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
yards tops how could you possibly know

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.860 
yards tops how could you possibly know
God<00:02:46.519> might<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.910> right<00:02:47.060> behind<00:02:47.299> you<00:02:47.570> all<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
God might be right behind you all the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.560 
God might be right behind you all the
time<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:52.090> think<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:53.180> there<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> God

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
time just like I think if there is a God

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.539 
time just like I think if there is a God
is<00:02:53.690> probably<00:02:53.959> not<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.170> one<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.310> way<00:02:55.400> they

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
is probably not the one the way they

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.949 
is probably not the one the way they
described<00:02:55.940> in<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.180> Bible<00:02:56.450> they<00:02:56.510> say<00:02:56.660> he's<00:02:56.810> our

mean and cheese sandwich we're like I
don't<00:03:50.139> know<00:03:50.319> you<00:03:50.439> bitch<00:03:51.569> feels<00:03:52.569> weird<00:03:52.689> I<00:03:53.970> think

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
don't know you bitch feels weird I think

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.080 
don't know you bitch feels weird I think
I<00:03:55.780> think<00:03:56.260> we<00:03:56.500> may<00:03:56.739> have<00:03:56.769> got<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.099> man<00:03:57.489> because<00:03:58.060> we

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I think we may have got a man because we

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.270 
I think we may have got a man because we
wanted<00:03:58.840> men<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.200> be<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.379> charge<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.129> made

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
wanted men to be in charge so it made

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.129 
wanted men to be in charge so it made
sense<00:04:00.310> because<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.419> doesn't<00:04:01.689> make<00:04:01.750> sense<00:04:01.810> that

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
sense because it doesn't make sense that

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.780 
sense because it doesn't make sense that
men<00:04:02.319> are<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.590> charge<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:03.280> makes<00:04:03.459> sense<00:04:03.609> the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
men are in charge it makes sense the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.819 
men are in charge it makes sense the
women<00:04:04.090> would<00:04:04.180> be<00:04:04.329> in<00:04:04.419> church<00:04:04.659> because<00:04:05.590> your

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
women would be in church because your

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.159 
women would be in church because your
mom<00:04:06.040> is<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.760> first<00:04:07.000> person<00:04:07.450> who<00:04:07.719> takes<00:04:07.900> care

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
mom is the first person who takes care

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.409 
mom is the first person who takes care
of<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.379> so<00:04:08.680> I'll<00:04:08.829> just<00:04:09.579> make<00:04:09.760> sense<00:04:10.180> that

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
of you so I'll just make sense that

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.339 
of you so I'll just make sense that
mothers<00:04:10.980> would<00:04:11.980> run<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.400> world<00:04:12.639> and<00:04:13.109> they<00:04:14.109> go

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
mothers would run the world and they go

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.539 
mothers would run the world and they go
it's<00:04:14.500> at<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.709> opposite<00:04:15.099> so<00:04:15.250> we<00:04:15.340> have<00:04:15.459> this

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
it's at the opposite so we have this

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.199 
it's at the opposite so we have this
weird<00:04:15.879> system<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.340> men<00:04:18.760> me<00:04:18.970> it's

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
weird system of you know men me it's

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.939 
weird system of you know men me it's
kind<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.419> helps<00:04:19.659> i<00:04:19.780> am<00:04:20.019> i<00:04:20.289> think<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.590> reason<00:04:20.739> is

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
kind of helps i am i think the reason is

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.800 
kind of helps i am i think the reason is
cuz<00:04:21.099> women<00:04:21.430> were<00:04:21.579> in<00:04:21.760> charge<00:04:21.970> one<00:04:22.300> time<00:04:22.570> ago

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
cuz women were in charge one time ago

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.870 
cuz women were in charge one time ago
and<00:04:23.080> they<00:04:23.650> were<00:04:23.680> really<00:04:24.130> mean<00:04:24.430> they<00:04:24.820> were

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
and they were really mean they were

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.170 
and they were really mean they were
