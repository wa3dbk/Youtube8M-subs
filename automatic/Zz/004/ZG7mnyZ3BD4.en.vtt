00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.230

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.630
 live 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.360

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.250
 the damned managed to escape but still 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.640
 I admit that the speed was a surprise 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.520
 of that type 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.010

 what did you recommend? 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.530
 ask at least 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.530
 Hello 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 the cabin gives me boss because we can already 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.840
 sleep peacefully if at least we have 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.850
 where to live for the moment good I think 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.000
 that it will be better to enter and give us a good 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.510
 siesta for all this 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.510
 kaka 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.780
 Hello everyone even though I did it in 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.030
 the fight video part 2 of anime what 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.130
 I will also make my presentation here 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.560
 what they gave good I'll start saying 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.030
 that my goals in loquendo are to do 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.250
 minimum 50 videos 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.530
 I really entertained doing this 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.990
 but it took a lot of time and I think that 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.420
 with doing 50 videos I could go 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.190
 quiet of this place the second I 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.770
 like to meet more boqueteros 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.410
 the more friends the better and in the avatar 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.420
 that he chose because his name is x is a 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.490
 mega man and I do not mean it's mega 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.680

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.490

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.440

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.600
 his name is ring came hero is a 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.820
 swordsman of the world of mayorazgo and not 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.190
 not having it to her means that I am 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.800
 a thought maniac I'm not that guy 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.320
