with their portable engine mechanically

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.059 
with their portable engine mechanically
it's<00:01:52.869> just<00:01:53.200> like<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.499> one<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.649> have<00:01:53.859> in<00:01:53.950> your

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
it's just like the one you have in your

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.760 
it's just like the one you have in your
car<00:01:54.539> first<00:01:55.539> they'll<00:01:55.929> mix<00:01:56.109> a<00:01:56.259> rather<00:01:56.439> unusual

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
car first they'll mix a rather unusual

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.580 
car first they'll mix a rather unusual
fuel<00:01:57.609> mixture<00:01:58.030> they<00:01:58.810> start<00:01:59.139> off<00:01:59.319> with<00:01:59.560> a

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
fuel mixture they start off with a

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.889 
fuel mixture they start off with a
little<00:01:59.829> gas<00:02:00.069> to<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.819> some<00:02:01.060> carbon<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.659> start

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
little gas to have some carbon to start

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.569 
little gas to have some carbon to start
the<00:02:02.049> engine<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.700> they<00:02:04.179> will<00:02:04.359> add<00:02:04.539> Pepsi<00:02:05.020> I

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
the engine to this they will add Pepsi I

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.769 
the engine to this they will add Pepsi I
think<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.759> it's<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.090> law<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.509> if<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.749> use

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
think that it's the law that if you use

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:11.130 
think that it's the law that if you use
Pepsi<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.069> also<00:02:09.220> use<00:02:09.399> coke<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.140> they

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
Pepsi you have to also use coke and they

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.670 
Pepsi you have to also use coke and they

of<00:02:44.290> your<00:02:44.440> unmodified<00:02:45.280> car<00:02:45.540> well<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.900> would

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
of your unmodified car well it would

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.600 
of your unmodified car well it would

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
freeze up the engine right there and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.030 
freeze up the engine right there and
then<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.780> let's<00:02:49.990> put<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> healthy<00:02:50.620> dose<00:02:50.800> of
