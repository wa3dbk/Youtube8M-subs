00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.379
 I'm going to be computer injured. 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.660
 time to bring down yet another edition of the computer program he had hoped for 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.220
 create and produce and publish 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.440
 that's Ricardo siggia 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 in fact the referendum will open 2d she messes with browsers as they say love 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.760
 in the internet age is the program you know 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 to access the most diverse web sites and news media weapons and see 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.310
 Internet browser 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 many people confuse even the term internet browser and with the singer 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.950
 matt stone ear 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.580
 internet explorer efe 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.800
 internet browser and about half 50% of users in brazil the game o 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 internet explorer to access the internet 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830
 but he is not the only digital teacher program here on the computer 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.280
 period there was a show with other programs 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.340
 For you to access the average income one of the main intentions of my 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.840
 program will be able to show 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.890
 several programs there you choose the most interesting for you to use what 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.740
 you like more 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.560
 but ensures that they explore from the majority of people whose visit to China because the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.399
 economic crisis comes installed in the computer of the closed assembler punished 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.940
 colossal and with the bug 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.290
 of internet explorer without a doubt this is a very good practice 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 but he already had many technical problems 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.660
 microsoft passed many years without launching an update we had profile of the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.740
 internet explorer 9 hours have arisen new technologies 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.950
 and it was getting lagged the developers were making the site 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.200
 in accordance with these new technologies and if it works in several 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 browsers or internet explorer it did not work right and you do not want to do it 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.460
 a pressure 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.880
 alternatively with some cambiasso to take abhisit from internet explorer 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.619
 This disrupted development 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.040
 this problem has already been solved in the latest versions lucas laurel 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.810
 but I particularly see some of his other problems mainly in 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.650
 In terms of accounts started to draw line 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.330
 of internet explorer very confusing or used I never understood the internet properly 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.260
 explorer which browsers lusos for sellers I will not recommend 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.840
 in this edition of the happy computer what will be missing 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.040
 that chrome mozilla firefox a little game 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.620
 the program will strengthen the popularity is growing that in the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.230
 brazil almost 30% of users to use firefox some people very emotive 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.900
 I called a possible name of the company that produces clothes of colors 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.469
 The club then died. 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
 browser any team currently quite popular 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.099
 and he made by the people 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.600
 equipped 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.670
 sites and programs also makes the confrontation 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.949
 these are the two browsers 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.629
 liked alternatives but the two main competitors of the internet 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.709
 explorer 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.060
 this the two coaches that I recommend you have been 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.420
 particularly the indiscriminate use 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.630
 distinctly for both landings and the chronometer pointed to lack in the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.759
 Small business 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.809
 it's not like the differences in style 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.209
 this is a theme 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.399
 future layoffs here of his computer in the next 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.959
 show the advantages of 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 and cool things you can do with each one of them 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:23.149
 so I would recommend Syrian museums these two programs besides there are 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.859
 other browsers that deserve to be cited 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.279
 safari that is produced by apple your default browser of computers 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.349
 market which will also curb delicacy pt 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.989
 there is nothing confirmed you will hear that it overcomes the data on the arsenal 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.230
 who reacts with internet long time useful runners 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.480
 traditional internet jarbas and already for sure today in its period of using the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.150
 change another problem these two programs because I'm not going 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.629
 recommend you charkie we have this great curious 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.019
 the screenplay is superbacana zone about what he did 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.169
 if we give a little thought in visual terms even 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.949
 but stated that the competition 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.949
 already the safari I think leaves something to be desired in some respects 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.150
 d customization for both google chrome that featured other tasks 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.339
 can be customized one thing I miss 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.339
 I do not like to have his career back. 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.950
 in possibilities of 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.919
 customization 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.840
 I was doing this research will speak badly what implies the manager to implant 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.270
 here the researcher all they have noticed here 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.500
 during the program I entered the site everything 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.460
 internet explorer 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.449
 and it is his yesterday 3 in the body and positive but it did not work 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.580
 the new rule will decide the wines to show how the wine's own website 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.270
 internet explorer resolves on internet explorer on these wanderings 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.210
 internetexplorer9 according to looks only 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.919
 however clarifies it works perfectly christalin up functional 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.919
 There you are for 600 years. 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.559
 revenue with google chrome 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.569
 a safari 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.689
 he got to pick up 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.959
 and you may have noticed that by clicking on the items added to the internet 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.339
 explorer 9 points with gutters not only in other browsers besides 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:27.349
 of the internet explorer itself in the system induce a marketing error 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.089
 to the user had to do the 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:34.099
 site compatible with all 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.669
 users 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.789
 Another disadvantage of internet explorer is that it is one thing 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.220
 even obvious is that this works on windows and windows environment 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.889
 the mobile version of the site they were released - lane on an idol 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.020
 1 to 7 I only know I have - said you can not even be there the last 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.719
 version 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.129
 doubt browser give microsoft 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.739
 roy bets to gradually boost a technology that 

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:05.290
 works with windows phone and extraversion at least 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.889
 and other browsers 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.069
 firefox the opera that I see working and including those of a 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.490
 thrombosis and also that on Sunday 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.930
 then any computer with six new titles that is 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.690
 operating system its use you can use these three browsers 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.050
 and at its pleasure only if it is to stay with the internet explorer always the 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.710
 internet explorer 9 point by point 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.800
 to falter the safari you win with the confrontation with the barça fábio 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.150
 the script is available in counterpoint with 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.320
 the father put the ball on the ground and backpack containing fuel complicit after 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.940
 their 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.130
 backpack with the one from the goal and the chrome and you go with the very compact group name 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.710
 they all reply to compete that google chrome 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.480
 automatically opens Portuguese in the case of backpacking you need to locate the 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.930
 Portuguese version 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.069
 You can lower it. 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.740
 agreements must be covered by the edict other languages ​​as well. 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.380
 are recommended and Portuguese composer 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.580
 the goalkeeper does not even get used to it and does not see much difference 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.840
 in this sense the next editions of the computer he even showed more 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.020
 in detail as sheila prepositions that later the google chrome souza charged 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.580
 dangerous but also our subway 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.699
 if all goes well you will have a good experience with other browsers 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:30.020
 dr internet 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.819
 only if you have any questions or shoes that he spent the day in command with 

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.440
 curator chris copper &amp; gold star 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.599
 and in the city still does not count with an extreme edition this program 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.229
 of caption until the next then Carol
