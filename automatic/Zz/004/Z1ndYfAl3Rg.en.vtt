00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.320
 yes and welcome here to a new one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.940
 play mode to which it would in fact 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 I mean skull hunter and it's one 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.550
 relatively simple game mode I just have to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.320
 Let's see that I do not advise Becker 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.060
 Schnitzel I'll explain you now 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 I like this game mode 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 I am with a certain kitty 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.189
 Equipped something from the game 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.289
 is affected and I have to now 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.060
 actually only other people kill 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.260
 and if I played someone 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.730
 I can demonstrate that right away 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.649
 it would not be abolished 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 okay, no problem and then you look 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.450
 First, the following one must 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.370
 his opponent's chin and that opponent's 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.289
 job then a skull 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:54.030
 and if you ask because a certain 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.260
 has me on the ass starts rÃ¼diger then 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.590
 you get a skull as well as this one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.360
 here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.190
 and this one must be in the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.809
 certain region over there 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.489
 skeleton stars carl there are so weird 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.439
 symbols you can see right now and the ones 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 Show in the direction of where I am in 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.299
 after all, this must be what dies me here 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.810
 thanks please and I have to 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.180
 so to speak, it would have to run in that direction 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 where this symbol is displayed but there are 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.479
 always so the marks a quasi 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.890
 show where exactly you have to run and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.460
 if you're up there then you have to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
 to be there 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.009
 leave skull and the more skulls one 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 Stop giving that you will become more 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.960
 also shown on the right in the display and 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.189
 the more one has collected the more 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.509
 the armor gets worse 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.259
 and then it gets harder 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.050
 to collect even more scalps and top in 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.640
 to stay in the rankings 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.260
 and the region always changes that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.970
 means that the donation point is not always 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 same place is where boy which 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.880
 shaved age that no longer normal 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.870
 yes that's why there is always government 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.900
 but I have not changed anymore 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.320
 I live the feeling of being so many 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.120
 it was different 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 exactly I want war almost exactly it 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.850
 was so I was wrong 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 I get the life from the one who 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.430
 I know and that will have me too 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.430
 displayed every time 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.740
 roche becomes so different 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.000
 taken middle ages lick me on the ass 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.220
 You almost always see who exactly how 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.630
 has many lives or who had how many 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.240
 and I'm just doing great like you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.500
 I have imagined and am six times 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.230
 but have died so far 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.720
 the dead does not deliver that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.380
 is a nice person from the server team 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.840
 that's no it's me too 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.770
 he's got two first 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.940
 scart okay i'll get you that good 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.690
 just knocked my door because of it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.580
 I called no 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.900
 if you have wondered so 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.880
 we have to look at the sign here 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.560
 I'm such a guy in sohar fast 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.590
 This please david piss off you have 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 I so now I give this was from - 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.470
 on the other hand, the simple soil 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.320
 throw and the region was likes 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.370
 Now I have two points now 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.910
 and of course a worse one 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.710
 armor okay 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.880
 so and before that too so that one the 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.380
 Do not pick up arrows from your opponents 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 I could do that with the guys 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.630
 the server team talked me that 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.670
 cool when come 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.810
 the kulap hand if you still the things 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.460
 can record but just now 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.600
 example is mine is my armor too 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.790
 it has become better for a short time 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.480
 once better 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.160
 after that it will actually mean 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.180
 effect only worse and completely on 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.390
 At the end, if you think that way 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.920
 then you get leather ten points 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.330
 armor wooden sword or something is because 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.240
 actually almost impossible against that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.350
 to fight people with his travel in addition 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.610
 but in itself the game mode is great 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.990
 simple and it actually needs 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.860
 exaggerated if not the whole 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.630
 are slaughtered 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.670
 the dying you have even worse 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.210
 Armor I can be his old boy 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.500
 young boy i am bad age good 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.030
 the food went through the preservation 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.110
 Walter, I'll be the first one 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.900
 would have been out now please die 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.340
 please die come come I know if 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 he runs away then it does not mean anything good 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.240
 for him already with the same 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.440
 child came to me so you can find the moment before 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.660
 8,9 seriously yes okay what the government must 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.260
 the region is ok, fast, too 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.420
 I'm so horny, he does not have it 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.790
 has done cleverly quickly 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.350
 fast no no 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.250
 then someone could back a distance 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.830
 it has to be said that now 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.600
 other places the deliver because every time 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.090
 oh, here is one who gives the skulls 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.980
 then changes the region and 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.780
 I just sent properly if there 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.000
 Now I like to think that now 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.380
 Please drop your skulls please 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.170
 please, please, please 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.190
 no no no i do not want to do that 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.810
 I do not want to be there 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.980
 because that's just my two skulls the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.810
 I'm glad I carried around and 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.940
 I do not know so encash this 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.490
 this justifies the leader after the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.100
 Dome Nick is also one of the squad 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.150
 on the server and against that I have 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.760
 even the days has played 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.920
 really taken me apart 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.760
 but I would like to do it now 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.050
 First I make a few points 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.870
 I absolutely 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.810
 is that your being serious i wanted me 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.060
 just down there kicking down there kick 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.810
 but apparently we still get it 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.370
 no case , it just seems to me 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.410
 I did not notice anything 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:27.040
 he noticed he is exaggerating yours 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.870
 Stock life clear of all world that is always 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.190
 such a pure slaughter really so if 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.770
 You are here in such an arena then it is 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.080
 really easy all the time if that 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.970
 all the time only in the second and just that 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.650
 I just like the whole thing 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.580
 actually only the view is and can 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.640
 is also celebrated all the time 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.340
 you fall relatively good pvp training 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.690
 Also learn how to be in front of your opponents 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.730
 that was sometimes his reference 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.410
 Must be aware of a skull there is a 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.150
 skull thank you very much 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.140
 and in which one would like to submit but 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.180
 I think they are just right 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.610
 lousy on the second 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.500
 that's why I do not want to work there and 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.550
 Of course, that's what you look like if you are 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.440
 we are using just one point 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.700
 Of course no one covers his 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.720
 points I can now have four 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.720
 one has already points 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.000
 Dominik already has 16 points I think 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.620
 I'm a bit a little bit on the ass 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.200
 or rather I win this way 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.700
 not at all but they are all too much 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.440
 better, yes, everything is pretty hard 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.370
 slaved like me a couple of times now 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.110
 first played 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.380
 That was a million times gambled 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.490
 and so they figure to much better 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.080
 in there and of course he has just 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.150
 my mainz can already be clenched here 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.229
 the little bastard thank you for the two 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.790
 skulls and now i want to go fast 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.930
 again it has to leave here 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.270
 so I here at least six points 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.020
 where the region would like to be there 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:43.669
 you quickly who can quickly here 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.229
 loud felix please as if they are already 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.770
 likes to have it like it how should i 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.699
 The fix for old swede 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.669
 does not seem normal anymore 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.780
 ok and a krad for 20 heads 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.880
 that means he has won so how 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.500
 when you reach 20 then you have 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.090
 I won in the case unfortunately 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.590
 not won but for me this has 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.820
 Dogs definitely a lot of fun 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.169
 and if you do that too 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.910
 then you can play on everyone 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.470
 falling on the server and come mcg 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.669
 because there is something special here this 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.789
 I can show you that 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.229
 this is the place and you can 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.510
 also here on suchen.de me here on the 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.039
 skull goes and then could be quasi 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.870
 Playing it gallant right now is belief 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:20.449
 I'm still in the beta so the people the 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.620
 We can do that now 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.960
 already play but soon it will be 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.099
 hold publicly for the other user 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.720
 there are a few things left 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:27.470
 which still have to be amended to make it 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.479
