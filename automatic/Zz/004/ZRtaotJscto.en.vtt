00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:44.430
The senko firework burns so painfully beautiful

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:56.520
I kept waiting for the end, but it happened when I wasn't looking
Before I could realize anything

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:09.870
That time, that person, that day, it all comes back to me

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:22.630
Why couldn't I see the future?
I always kept singing our song

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:35.410
And now I'm staring at a shooting star
But I can only think of one wish

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:47.600
No matter how hard I pray, it won't come true

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:58.700
I know this is how things will be
But I don't want to run away

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:08.810
The pain grows
I wonder if we can ever go back...

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:47.700
Why am I still in love with her?
It's all over

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:59.610
But I can't forget about us
I don't want to forget

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:10.510
I know this is how things will be
But I don't want to run away

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:22.630
No matter how painful it may be
I'm still in love with you

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:34.830
Even as you were saying "Wow, it's so beautiful" as the firework slowly burned out

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:47.570
Your smile was the only thing I could see
That was truly happiness

00:03:47.570 --> 00:04:09.310
All I want to see is your smiling face
That alone is happiness
