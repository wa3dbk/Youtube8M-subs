this<00:00:24.930> super<00:00:25.470> compact<00:00:25.949> let's<00:00:26.550> switch<00:00:26.760> design

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
this super compact let's switch design

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
this super compact let's switch design
so<00:00:28.710> i'm<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> hop<00:00:29.039> over<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.789> i'm<00:00:30.000> not

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so i'm going to hop over here i'm not

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.240 
so i'm going to hop over here i'm not
even<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> stop<00:00:30.900> recording<00:00:31.199> we're<00:00:32.040> just

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
even going to stop recording we're just

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
even going to stop recording we're just
going<00:00:32.400> to<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.940> field<00:00:35.940> field<00:00:36.330> sun<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.899> going

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
going to go so field field sun is going

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.819 
going to go so field field sun is going
down<00:00:37.969> can<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.360> time<00:00:39.570> well<00:00:40.440> i'm<00:00:40.710> going

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
down can we do it in time well i'm going

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.170 
down can we do it in time well i'm going
to<00:00:40.890> put<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.250> there<00:00:41.510> we're<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> put

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
to put that there we're going to put

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.240 
to put that there we're going to put
more<00:00:45.180> blocks<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> fact<00:00:46.140> pissed<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
more blocks there in fact pissed in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.410 
more blocks there in fact pissed in
there<00:00:47.489> that's<00:00:47.879> important<00:00:48.949> block<00:00:50.090> piston<00:00:51.090> even

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
there that's important block piston even

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.410 
there that's important block piston even
here<00:00:52.050> look<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:53.960> pressure<00:00:54.960> plate<00:00:55.230> their

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
here look here pressure plate their

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
here look here pressure plate their
track<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.370> told

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
track I'm not going the way it's told

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
track I'm not going the way it's told
that's<00:01:00.480> fine<00:01:00.870> fix<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:03.019> push<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that's fine fix it like that push the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.050 
that's fine fix it like that push the
mine<00:01:04.320> cart<00:01:04.530> onto<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> plate<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:08.300> that's<00:01:09.300> it

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.999 

both<00:01:13.659> pistons<00:01:14.110> work<00:01:14.560> as<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.860> bird<00:01:15.220> switch<00:01:15.899> so

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
both pistons work as a bird switch so

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.899 
both pistons work as a bird switch so
while<00:01:18.009> that<00:01:18.899> whoops<00:01:20.460> invalidated<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.700> work

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
while that whoops invalidated that work

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.920 
while that whoops invalidated that work
and<00:01:23.399> well<00:01:25.049> let's<00:01:26.049> just<00:01:26.259> burn<00:01:26.439> really<00:01:26.680> quickly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and well let's just burn really quickly

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.529 
and well let's just burn really quickly
that<00:01:28.930> has<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.740> be<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.039> side<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.610> reason

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
that has to be to the side a reason

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.580 
that has to be to the side a reason
being<00:01:31.720> there's<00:01:31.899> nowhere<00:01:32.110> else<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.380> put<00:01:32.530> it

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
being there's nowhere else to put it

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.179 
being there's nowhere else to put it
where<00:01:32.799> it<00:01:32.830> will<00:01:33.070> grow<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:34.320> not<00:01:35.320> get<00:01:36.039> in<00:01:36.159> the

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
where it will grow and not get in the

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.100 
where it will grow and not get in the
way<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.490> piston<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:36.880> also<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:37.750> need<00:01:38.049> to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
way of the piston and also you need to

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.740 
way of the piston and also you need to
space<00:01:38.500> these<00:01:38.770> one<00:01:39.369> block<00:01:39.640> apart<00:01:40.090> otherwise

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
space these one block apart otherwise

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.020 
space these one block apart otherwise
when<00:01:41.140> one<00:01:41.409> trick<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:41.829> though<00:01:42.039> cause<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> chain

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
when one trick is though cause a chain

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.999 
when one trick is though cause a chain
reaction<00:01:43.060> down<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.869> line<00:01:44.110> which<00:01:44.890> you

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
reaction down the line which you

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.210 
reaction down the line which you
probably<00:01:45.250> don't<00:01:45.700> want<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:48.190> is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
probably don't want and that is

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.999 
probably don't want and that is
literally<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.299> when<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> melon<00:01:50.259> crows<00:01:50.530> there<00:01:50.799> it

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
literally it when a melon crows there it

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.120 
literally it when a melon crows there it
will<00:01:51.130> be<00:01:51.280> pushed<00:01:51.580> out<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.890> knock<00:01:56.979> it

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
will be pushed out I'm going to knock it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.309 
will be pushed out I'm going to knock it
down<00:01:57.250> because<00:01:57.459> it<00:01:57.640> offends<00:01:57.819> my<00:01:58.030> sensibilities

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
down because it offends my sensibilities

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.410 
down because it offends my sensibilities
don't<00:01:59.319> mind<00:01:59.500> me

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.940 

now<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:03.860> be<00:02:04.070> adapted<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:05.740> work<00:02:06.740> with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
now this can be adapted to work with

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.910 
now this can be adapted to work with
pumpkins<00:02:07.430> obviously<00:02:08.300> not<00:02:08.929> demonstrated<00:02:09.739> but

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
pumpkins obviously not demonstrated but

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.540 
pumpkins obviously not demonstrated but
you<00:02:10.099> get<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.280> idea<00:02:11.170> raise<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:12.470> one<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.920> you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
you get the idea raise it up one and you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.699 
you get the idea raise it up one and you
can<00:02:13.670> get<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.940> work<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.300> reads<00:02:14.709> slightly

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
can get it to work with reads slightly

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.890 
can get it to work with reads slightly
ineffective<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.750> do<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.900> you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
ineffective but you can do it and you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.140 
ineffective but you can do it and you
can<00:02:21.440> get<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.220> work<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.610> characters<00:02:23.000> I'm

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
can get it to work with characters I'm

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.970 
can get it to work with characters I'm
going<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.390> review<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.230> one<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:25.010> really

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
going to review this one this is really

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.640 
going to review this one this is really
doesn't<00:02:27.980> work<00:02:28.160> very<00:02:28.190> well<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:29.000> put<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.180> mildly

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
doesn't work very well to put it mildly

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.110 
doesn't work very well to put it mildly
when<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:30.800> not<00:02:30.920> dropping<00:02:31.220> off<00:02:31.459> here<00:02:31.819> it's

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
when it's not dropping off here it's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.800 
when it's not dropping off here it's
falling<00:02:32.630> onto<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.410> cactus<00:02:33.739> itself<00:02:34.099> and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
falling onto the cactus itself and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.449 
falling onto the cactus itself and
destroying<00:02:35.860> thankfully<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:36.980> got<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.280> just

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
destroying thankfully you got to just

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.820 
destroying thankfully you got to just
see<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.730> working<00:02:37.940> well<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.480> yes<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.290> shoved<00:02:39.620> ice

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
see it working well and yes I shoved ice
