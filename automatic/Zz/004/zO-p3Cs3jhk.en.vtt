00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
folder and it shouldn't take too long

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.100 
folder and it shouldn't take too long
but<00:02:59.020> once<00:02:59.560> it's<00:03:00.010> copied<00:03:00.310> into<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.030> USB<00:03:01.630> you're

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
but once it's copied into the USB you're

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.920 
but once it's copied into the USB you're
gonna<00:03:02.230> want<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.970> safely<00:03:03.970> eject<00:03:04.240> your<00:03:04.330> USB<00:03:04.570> and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
gonna want to safely eject your USB and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.580 
gonna want to safely eject your USB and
then<00:03:05.260> put<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.160> into<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.850> USB<00:03:07.840> slot<00:03:08.170> that's<00:03:08.470> on

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
then put it into the USB slot that's on

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.280 
then put it into the USB slot that's on
the<00:03:08.680> right<00:03:08.830> hand<00:03:09.040> side<00:03:09.130> on<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.820> ps3<00:03:10.290> it's

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the right hand side on the ps3 it's

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.620 
the right hand side on the ps3 it's
because<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:12.130> reduces<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.910> risk<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.330> getting

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
because it reduces the risk of getting

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.410 
because it reduces the risk of getting
bricked<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.290> it's<00:03:14.709> also<00:03:14.920> more<00:03:15.220> safe<00:03:15.550> I'm<00:03:16.090> not

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
bricked and it's also more safe I'm not

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.259 
bricked and it's also more safe I'm not
really<00:03:16.840> sure<00:03:17.200> why<00:03:17.440> but<00:03:17.769> as<00:03:18.640> far<00:03:18.850> as<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.120> know

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
really sure why but as far as I know

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.880 
really sure why but as far as I know
that<00:03:19.480> they<00:03:19.720> are<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:20.230> are<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.440> two<00:03:20.650> main

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
that they are there are the two main

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.830 
that they are there are the two main
reasons<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.640> you<00:03:22.209> should<00:03:22.239> use<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
reasons that you should use the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.420 
reasons that you should use the
right-hand<00:03:23.380> USB<00:03:23.980> side<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:25.800> yeah<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.100> once

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
right-hand USB side and yeah so once

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.729 
right-hand USB side and yeah so once
this<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:28.060> finished<00:03:28.660> copying<00:03:29.320> we're<00:03:29.590> just

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
this is finished copying we're just

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.690 
this is finished copying we're just
gonna<00:03:29.890> safely<00:03:30.430> eject<00:03:30.910> our<00:03:31.680> USB<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:35.010> then<00:03:36.010> take

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
gonna safely eject our USB and then take

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.090 
gonna safely eject our USB and then take
a<00:03:36.730> USB<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.690> then<00:03:37.900> put<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.290> inside<00:03:38.590> your<00:03:38.650> p3

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
a USB out and then put it inside your p3

again so as you can see it says
installing<00:05:25.380> do<00:05:25.560> not<00:05:25.680> turn<00:05:25.890> off<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.130> system

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
installing do not turn off the system

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.250 
installing do not turn off the system
after<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:27.300> install<00:05:27.630> operation<00:05:28.170> has

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
after the install operation has

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.630 
after the install operation has
completed<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.740> system<00:05:29.070> will<00:05:29.190> automatically

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
completed the system will automatically

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.730 
completed the system will automatically
restart<00:05:29.910> so<00:05:30.750> I'm<00:05:31.020> gonna<00:05:31.170> pause<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.530> video

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
restart so I'm gonna pause the video

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.830 
restart so I'm gonna pause the video
again<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.250> when<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.060> done<00:05:33.210> I'll<00:05:33.420> come<00:05:33.660> back

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
again and when it's done I'll come back

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
and I'll show you guys if you installed

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.370 
and I'll show you guys if you installed
465<00:05:40.110> I<00:05:40.290> thought<00:05:40.530> then<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:40.890> should<00:05:41.070> say<00:05:41.310> webmin

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
465 I thought then you should say webmin

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.470 
465 I thought then you should say webmin
activated<00:05:43.380> meaning<00:05:44.130> that<00:05:44.750> it's<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:46.050> integrated

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
activated meaning that it's a integrated

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.840 
activated meaning that it's a integrated
feature<00:05:48.480> of<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.170> custom<00:05:49.590> firmware<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:50.670> you

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
feature of the custom firmware that you

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.970 
feature of the custom firmware that you
just<00:05:51.000> installed<00:05:51.480> so<00:05:52.110> now<00:05:52.680> I'm<00:05:52.800> just<00:05:52.860> gonna

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
just installed so now I'm just gonna

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.950 
just installed so now I'm just gonna
press<00:05:53.490> my<00:05:53.550> home<00:05:53.880> button<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.330> go<00:05:54.840> into<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.740> ps3

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
press my home button and go into the ps3

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.430 
press my home button and go into the ps3
so<00:05:58.280> what<00:05:59.280> you<00:05:59.370> should<00:05:59.580> see<00:05:59.850> is<00:06:00.150> now<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:00.900> can

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
so what you should see is now you can

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.220 
so what you should see is now you can
install<00:06:01.770> package<00:06:02.280> files<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:03.210> my<00:06:03.810> USB<00:06:04.170> is

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
install package files so my USB is

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.450 
install package files so my USB is
connected<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.770> these<00:06:04.950> are<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.190> package

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
connected and these are the package

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.640 
connected and these are the package
files<00:06:05.640> I<00:06:05.790> have<00:06:05.820> inside<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.540> so<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.410> should<00:06:07.620> be

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
files I have inside it so I should be

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.820 
files I have inside it so I should be
able<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:08.040> install<00:06:08.880> them<00:06:09.140> once<00:06:10.140> I'm<00:06:10.380> jailbroken

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
able to install them once I'm jailbroken
