00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
machine at the moment then the frame

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
machine at the moment then the frame
rate<00:00:25.289> shall<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:25.590> higher<00:00:25.800> mr.<00:00:26.279> met<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.849> have

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
something about that it's the spin out

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.000 
something about that it's the spin out
for<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> while<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> ten<00:01:05.339> thousand<00:01:05.850> rpms

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
for a while it's the ten thousand rpms

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
for a while it's the ten thousand rpms
drive<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> see-through<00:01:09.090> mirror

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
drive it's what the see-through mirror

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
drive it's what the see-through mirror
on<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> window<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> pretty

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
good and it will show that spinning up

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.609 
good and it will show that spinning up
in<00:01:13.740> how<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.950> works<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.960> how<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.560> you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
okay okay so now on to the hard drive

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.240 
okay okay so now on to the hard drive
now<00:03:31.530> when<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.800> install<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.370> drive<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:34.200> would

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
now when you install this drive I would

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.160 
now when you install this drive I would
really<00:03:36.250> recommend<00:03:36.460> that<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.900> get<00:03:38.020> one

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
really recommend that if you get one

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.800 
really recommend that if you get one

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
like off of mine this is a property of

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.440 
like off of mine this is a property of
hard<00:03:44.200> drive<00:03:44.410> bay<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:45.610> its<00:03:45.730> own<00:03:45.850> custom<00:03:46.240> file

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
hard drive bay with its own custom file

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.210 
hard drive bay with its own custom file
the<00:03:46.600> front<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.560> got<00:03:47.680> through<00:03:47.830> speed

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
the front you just got through speed

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.820 
the front you just got through speed
settings<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.700> change<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:50.590> hard

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
settings you can change it this hard

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.680 
settings you can change it this hard
drive<00:03:50.950> gets<00:03:51.220> extremely<00:03:51.700> hot<00:03:51.820> because

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
drive gets extremely hot because

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.330 
drive gets extremely hot because
obviously<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:53.110> faster<00:03:53.500> than<00:03:53.650> regular<00:03:54.010> hard

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
obviously it's faster than regular hard

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.690 
obviously it's faster than regular hard
drive<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:56.440> yeah<00:03:56.710> I<00:03:56.890> find<00:03:57.160> out<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.310> desk<00:03:57.550> before

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
drive so yeah I find out the desk before

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.090 
drive so yeah I find out the desk before
I<00:03:57.910> hit<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.180> now<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.600> it's<00:03:58.720> it's<00:03:59.020> sort<00:03:59.320> of<00:03:59.380> gonna

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
burn off on the desk from the heat so I

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.530 
burn off on the desk from the heat so I
wouldn't<00:04:03.430> recommend<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:04.030> put<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.240> some<00:04:04.390> of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
these things no alternated speeds you

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.040 
these things no alternated speeds you
can<00:04:07.150> change<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:08.430> drive<00:04:09.430> look<00:04:10.390> on<00:04:10.660> virtual

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
can change it to drive look on virtual

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.390 
can change it to drive look on virtual
front<00:04:11.290> you<00:04:11.410> can<00:04:11.470> see<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.890> actual<00:04:12.010> drive

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
front you can see the actual drive

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400 
front you can see the actual drive
itself<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.090> took<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> little<00:04:13.720> reader<00:04:13.960> now<00:04:14.200> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
itself and took a little reader now and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.440 
itself and took a little reader now and
it's<00:04:14.500> bearing<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.100> this<00:04:15.610> thing<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.000> reads<00:04:16.209> and
