00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:11.330
 This time I would like to ask Nagaship players how to beat straight and cross in the backhand 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.330
 I think 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.430
 Hmm 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.640

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 Not that I different, but be destroyed here in Yes Lison at the time of the net cross-hand servant does also 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.000
 Please go through your right foot 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.620
 Such as bring in front of the subspecies enter would not it ugly turn in the body 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 It was one that hit and that so play in the image 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.140
 I'm this because the high ball wo n't slip 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.489
 It is decided that you decide hard and follow the image before you follow 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.049
 is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.070
 Professional and always went Nde copy at the feet and move up to Toko of another queue Ernest Par 4 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.920
 Speaking of the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.490
 Decide your feet 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 It Tteyuu have come to the point where foot overtakes the right foot after scoring to put Oh I see people 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.070
 is not it 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.930

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.710
 ok thank you so sure that body rotates and limbs about it 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.840
 It is that but to finish and properly oriented in the cross is 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 I think that everyone who put straight is more difficult but what tips do you have ? 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.460
 It's box Tari and height good at 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.530
 I 'm a little old 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.119
 Sometimes flowing in the straight 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.710
 It feels like a cross, but if I say this at the school opening wrist I still 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.570
 Right and left blur enters 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 The sight of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.689
 Yes 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.230
 Without or high bra or doing doing noodles 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.250
 The noodles remain vertical 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.020
 But Ja indeed Oh image raise on this 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.890
 I feel like I'm swinging vertically . 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:21.580
 Yes, it will be raining and I will distribute it like that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.030
 It is said that consciousness goes to the racket of the side near the place held by the low expression 's holding hand 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 It is 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.350

 Ok then please hit 8 balls or straight 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.690
 Certainly it feels like you don't return the racquet head than when hitting a cross 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.990
 It is very jazz 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.480
 Very accurate 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.060
