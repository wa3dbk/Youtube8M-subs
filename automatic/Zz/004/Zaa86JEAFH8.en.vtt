00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello at simon I think for you 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:46.860
 playmobil citylife childless and that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:49.610
 I think that's from a schoolyard then 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610
 the slide 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:18.770
 here is the whole build up 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:48.179
 this one and that is not there yet 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 again the lego star wars setting for 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.319
 it was just something for me 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.959
 children heavy fans open father 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:18.870
 refrain because he is there for and 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:22.459
 not so good it can not be built 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.459
 I had to take out 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.430
 so now it's about that the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:42.750
 Slide it up to climb 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:50.849
 because you can barely stand up but there is 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:54.930
 the 1 2 and 3 and 4 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:59.160
 actually should be like that and then should 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.760
 but the trans are stuck in it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.919
 stay 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.959
 and that's why there is a medium here too 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.510
 little of infected namely in here and 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.019
 We can not get that out but like that 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.889
 Bad was I find also the most beautiful 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.889
 days 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.970
 so now if you need it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.860
 that now where the swing and the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.950
 slide 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.920
 there you can climb up then I build 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:53.319
 now here the numbers always look like this 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.989
 then there comes a bit of me here 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:10.600
 have just built so then here comes the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:15.280
 karo cells a small carousel 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:19.390
 bit and animal then that and that 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:27.610
 Baumeister a flowerbed later on 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:30.880
 Corner and I find just one more 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.770
 bit childish and no longer for 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.130
 my age I'm almost 8 because of that 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.979
 me for me but for little children 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.290
 to 4 is relatively funny and funny 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.660
 make up that begotten many things 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.060
 can cover together and children can 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.810
 the entertainment slide down so now but 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.930
 first reaction down to the next 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.930
 times
