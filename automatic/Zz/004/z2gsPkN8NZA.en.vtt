00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.210
 Now these dear friends mw for you 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.559
 I have good news for those who 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.139
 enjoys science 58 00 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.139
 There is a new version of the firmware 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.589
 fortieth 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.330
 Here I am actually hers and after a certain 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.289
 teachings could still put 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.080
 and now we have our own can now rejoice 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.689
 actually her how you see these changes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050
 already touched the main screen 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.689
 here we have a panel on it 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.270
 contacts and its exactly the way it is now and 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.879
 knock out credited the wall phone with this 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.649
 hand we have contacts but 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.040
 according to the most favorite hiv 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.840
 show you this kinetic 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 scrolling 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.610
 so here we are pushing contacts and 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.060
 now we can move freely 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.210
 possible wedge stronger we will move 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.810
 by the very 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.190
 the same object is pretty tokyo convenient 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.500
 percent smooth scrolling was not 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.110
 accounting 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.030
 netbook general then they are scrolling 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 almost all of the name are present 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.490
 actually this is what the main one looks like 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.079
 screen 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.159
 the phone still looks like us 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.400
 in this way 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.770
 go to the menu 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.130
 the menu has changed a little and not 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.869
 I remember how it was in the thirty first but 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.229
 here 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.180
 Now an analogue so who looks like 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.920
 It means that you rate as 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.100
 looks for example 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.430
 other functions such as parameters 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.570
 something can be done yes 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050
 personal percentage 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.610
 percentage of the main 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.660
 screen 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.620
 Look here, there is China 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.670
 so the main temple 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.870
 Let's see 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.860
 here you see the contact bar here 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.520
 we generally appear to her on the main 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.150
 screen 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.710
 to put 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.659
 so as you can see here here 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.110
 also present but the same scrolling on 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.500
 scroll through the property for now 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.490
 there is nothing 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 well let's go for example to music 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.190
 musician 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.190
 a music player 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
 all compositions 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.910
 but here we are now with 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.249
 pleasure we can mind 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.250
 scroll though 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.949
 all of you are all melodies 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.379
 here previously use this this 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:16.729
 that 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.150
 uncomfortable barre 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.480
 from his side told the filmmakers it or not 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.219
 I do not know yet 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.189
 yes he by the way works 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.529
 that's why you can manage like a finger 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.529
 so actually this bar on the left 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.239
 here but he won't be long on it 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.209
 linger 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.859
 move all the same to appoint first 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.209
 calendars 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.149
 That's how it all looks like now 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.909
 further contacts that showed you 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.099
 how do they look 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.709
 here 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.989
 call log will not but in my there 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.599
 all zeros should be 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.829
 departed so also remained 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.529
 here's the internet I will not show you though 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.439
 theoretically possible but i thought 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.799
 following supports 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.199
 ohh in the messages we have such a thing 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.739
 as 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.319
 evaluation typing automatic 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.490
 opens in this version of the set 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.490
 but as soon as we turn 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.319
 we have an automatic phone 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.849
 reveals full size 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.889
 keyboard that's very comfortable 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.819
 than when we selected separately 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.399
 keyboard 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.289
 we have her now so small 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.889
 keyboard which can be transferred 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.899
 dome anywhere here we are respectively 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.419
 our full size 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.919
 remains 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.149
 here is such 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.829
 so pretty comfortable 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.439
 turn over brother nissan note sen 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.989
 good keyboard 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.629
 that's what it looks like now 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.369
 here we are closing 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:46.749
 present here too 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.709
 kinetic scrolling is all very 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.679
 conveniently 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.090
 in the gallery 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.390
 but I think that there is nothing special 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.390
 I did not touch I think everything is at the same level 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.609
 further I would show the music 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.809
 cards 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.179
 as for he 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.600
 m phone speed 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.100
 in principle, and he probably stayed on 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.919
 same level ie speed 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.989
 as it was pretty good and 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:15.819
 left 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.129
 so but we will not connect here yet 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.979
 nothing 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.949
 this is where the places left from where I was 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.960
 tried to connect 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.039
 Now they say now in general we will not 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.610
 at least by SMS 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.439
 percent what program 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.479
 here we can see so the third version 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.439
 version from 3 result 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.439
 we are here from the Supreme writing 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.729
 that's why the market light 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.840
 so here, too, we have present 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.029
 scrolling which is also very uncomfortable 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:50.990
 this is how it works 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.909
 options 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.909
 personal 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.159
 in general, everything else is left on 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:01.349
 former level 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.599
 I thought so what a data transfer but 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.879
 maybe it was 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.830
 here is a certificate 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.339
 application 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.049
 percentage so what we have added here and what 

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:12.430
 removed the news 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.970
 and while I see my programs, here they are 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.199
 often go 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.069
 Inter settings dictionary 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.099
 here she appeared soon contacts and 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.990
 update zeal 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.050
 here are the rest of my program 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.580
 what to see the firmware version means 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.860
 increased shock fund 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.779
 asterisk lattice times absent 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.830
 moved to chicago 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.460
 and review versions 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.689
 40 Noah 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.759
 005 date of the version of the twenty-ninth 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.539
 the twelfth 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.399
 the percentage is also kinetic 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.150
 scrolling is used he 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.559
 need to go out 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:50.269
 in the next video review I you 

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:51.900
 tell you about 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.060
 can upgrade garden to this 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.160
 firmware version 0 respectively to 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.729
 next firmware 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.639
 for now all good luck
