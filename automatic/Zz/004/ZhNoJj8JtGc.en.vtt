00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.650
 we get up in the morning of a day 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.800
 important and we discover with horror that 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.509

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.240

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.070
 often leave granites it is likely that 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.230
 you know a million products that 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.750
 they help eliminate them but today what 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.879
 let's see are three natural ways of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.400
 do it and there will not be any trace of 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.129
 granite that we had a little while before in 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.500
 our face how to eliminate the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.410
 granites of the face there are several tricks 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.570
 natural to eliminate granites those that 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.399
 they use ingredients that are super common 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.449
 in the kitchen so there's no need 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.430
 to buy anything with lemon juice 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.579
 a lemon in half and pass it by the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.890
 area where the granites are if one is 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 it is only advisable that you tighten a 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.450
 little lemon and swab it 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.789
 apply just on the granite because 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.710
 the lemon acid is very astringent and 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.310
 It can irritate your skin so better 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.450
 put it alone where it really takes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 let the juice act for about 10 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.920
 minutes ago it is natural to be from a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.100
 little bit and then rinse your face with 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.079
 cold water an extra recommendation is that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.210
 do not use this recipe on sunny days 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.549
 because the acid combined with the sun 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.720
 can make a speck come out in your 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.610
 skin with baking soda mixes a 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.310
 little baking soda with water 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.039
 form a paste and then place it on 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.439
 your pimple with a swab when they have 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.619
 After 10 minutes you can remove it with 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.229
 plentiful cold water because it works 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.569
 because the bicarbonate restores the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.280
 ph imbalance of the skin and that 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.009
 It is usually the cause of them leaving 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.679
 granites is also great because 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.929
 It deflates and is antiseptic so it lowers 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.170
 our grain and disinfects everything to 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.149
 same time with a raw potato the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.280
 potatoes or potatoes are astringent 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.950
 decrease the size of our 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.110
 granites and also have enzymes that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.620
 help the burns caused by 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.319
 acne scar in faster and better 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.819
 as we use it, cut a slice and with 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.380
 patience rub through the area 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.470
 problematic by 20 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.300
 30 minutes when you finish do not clean yourself 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.300
 let him act all day
