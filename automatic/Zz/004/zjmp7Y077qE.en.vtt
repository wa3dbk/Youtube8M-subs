to come in off attack planing with good

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
to come in off attack planing with good
speed<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.469> start<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> move<00:00:52.949> by<00:00:53.280> edging

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
speed you will start to move by edging

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.040

or<00:00:53.850> pointing<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> board<00:00:54.570> higher<00:00:54.750> into<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
or pointing the board higher into the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
or pointing the board higher into the
wind<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:55.829> shed<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> speed

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
wind this will shed some of the speed

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
wind this will shed some of the speed
and<00:00:56.910> also<00:00:57.210> make<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> easier<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> pop<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> board

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and also make it easier to pop the board

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
and also make it easier to pop the board
into<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> air<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.090> choppy

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
into the air if it's choppy

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.689 
into the air if it's choppy
it<00:01:00.719> helps<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> spot-clean<00:01:01.590> ramp<00:01:01.920> pop<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> board

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it helps a spot-clean ramp pop the board

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
it helps a spot-clean ramp pop the board
out<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> water<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:03.960> you're<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.199> flat
