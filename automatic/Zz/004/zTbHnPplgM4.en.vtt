 on the little sheet where they gave me the number and 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.180
 I did not know how to recover it by investigating 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.350
 out there the telephone company showed 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.310
 that is the code to be able 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.710
 recover a number from a movistar chip 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.440
 to be able to take it out in the number to draw 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.100

 comment if I feel that this is a 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.420
 problem is also sad that there 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.340
 some cases where it's not 61 62 and it was 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 approved with the asterisk mich numbers 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.010
 and 61 mich and the other is asterisk mich and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.670
 62,000 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.869
 but with either one of these 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.270
 example if you are going to be able to pass that you are going to 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.100
 to be able to recover a Movistar number 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.790
