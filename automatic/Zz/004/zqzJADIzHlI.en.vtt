for your aquarium this can be quite a

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.890 
for your aquarium this can be quite a
confusing<00:00:11.010> job<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.150> go<00:00:12.269> into<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.540> fish

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
confusing job as you go into your fish

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.379 
confusing job as you go into your fish
store<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.469> you'll<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:14.009> ten<00:00:14.639> different<00:00:15.150> names

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
store and you'll see ten different names

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.500 
store and you'll see ten different names
there<00:00:15.809> are<00:00:15.839> all<00:00:16.320> different<00:00:16.350> prices<00:00:17.510> hopefully

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
there are all different prices hopefully

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
this video is going to go some way to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.330 
this video is going to go some way to
making<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.630> job<00:00:21.930> considerably<00:00:22.740> easier<00:00:22.980> for

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
making this job considerably easier for

you<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:25.350> let's<00:00:25.859> take<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.519> what<00:00:26.699> parts

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you so let's take a look at what parts

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.120 
you so let's take a look at what parts
make<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.660> canister<00:00:28.050> filter<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
make up a canister filter and how this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.700 
make up a canister filter and how this
will<00:00:29.279> help<00:00:29.490> us<00:00:29.670> decide<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.630> which<00:00:31.170> filter<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
will help us decide in which filter to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
will help us decide in which filter to
use<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.189> our<00:00:32.219> aquarium<00:00:32.989> firstly<00:00:33.989> you've<00:00:34.290> got

trays this is where our media is going
to<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.600> contained<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> best<00:00:53.699> way<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> set

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to be contained and the best way to set

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
to be contained and the best way to set
one<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.510> these<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.379> set<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> foams<00:00:56.070> at

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
one of these up is we set the foams at

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.510 
one of these up is we set the foams at
the<00:00:56.640> bottom<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> floss<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:59.100> does<00:00:59.340> all

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the bottom and the floss this does all

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
the bottom and the floss this does all
the<00:00:59.910> mechanical<00:01:00.750> side<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> filtration

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the mechanical side of the filtration

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
the mechanical side of the filtration
then<00:01:02.489> stops<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:04.040> sintered<00:01:05.040> glass<00:01:05.280> media<00:01:05.790> or

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
then stops the sintered glass media or

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450 
then stops the sintered glass media or
the<00:01:06.420> ceramic<00:01:06.720> media<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.619> becoming<00:01:07.979> clogged

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the ceramic media from becoming clogged

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.300 
the ceramic media from becoming clogged
with<00:01:08.670> dirt<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> debris<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.630> detritus<00:01:10.350> which

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
with dirt and debris and detritus which

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
with dirt and debris and detritus which
then<00:01:11.580> reduces<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> performance<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
then reduces the performance of the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
then reduces the performance of the
filter<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.780> pick<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.290> filter<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
filter so how do we pick a filter the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.420 
filter so how do we pick a filter the
pump<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> key<00:01:20.100> part<00:01:20.720> we<00:01:21.720> pick<00:01:21.990> our<00:01:22.430> filter

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
pump is the key part we pick our filter

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.050 
pump is the key part we pick our filter
via<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.900> much<00:01:25.140> flow<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:26.130> many<00:01:26.189> times<00:01:26.400> we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
via how much flow or how many times we

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
via how much flow or how many times we
can<00:01:27.270> turn<00:01:27.509> our<00:01:27.689> tank<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.380> per<00:01:28.619> hour<00:01:28.890> for

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
can turn our tank over per hour for

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
can turn our tank over per hour for
example<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:31.350> was<00:01:31.650> filtering<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> hundred

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
example if I was filtering a hundred

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.810 
example if I was filtering a hundred
liter<00:01:32.880> tank<00:01:33.270> I'd<00:01:34.020> need<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.070> four

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
liter tank I'd need this to do four

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.770 
liter tank I'd need this to do four
times<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.689> per<00:01:37.200> hour<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.490> need<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.000> 400

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
times that per hour so it need to do 400

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.249 
times that per hour so it need to do 400
liters<00:01:40.170> per<00:01:40.740> hour<00:01:41.329> that's<00:01:42.329> provided<00:01:42.869> by<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
liters per hour that's provided by the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.460 
liters per hour that's provided by the
head<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.549> canister<00:01:45.030> filter<00:01:45.509> doesn't

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
head but the canister filter doesn't

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
head but the canister filter doesn't
actually<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.100> any<00:01:47.250> filtering<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
actually do any filtering all it is is a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.889 
actually do any filtering all it is is a
form<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.590> water<00:01:49.979> movement<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.270> vessel<00:01:51.720> for

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
form of water movement and a vessel for

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
form of water movement and a vessel for
hole<00:01:52.079> during<00:01:52.290> filter<00:01:53.250> media<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.180> most

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
hole during filter media the most

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
hole during filter media the most
important<00:01:55.110> part<00:01:55.350> about<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.159> canister<00:01:56.579> filter

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
important part about the canister filter

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.630 
important part about the canister filter
is<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:58.049> media<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.219> here<00:01:59.490> because

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
is what media we put in here because

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.149 
is what media we put in here because
this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.240> where<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.200> filtration<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> all

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this is where all the filtration and all

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.090 
this is where all the filtration and all
the<00:02:02.310> hard<00:02:02.579> work<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> done

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
the hard work is going to be done

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
the hard work is going to be done
everything<00:02:05.100> else<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> combined<00:02:06.210> unit<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
everything else as a combined unit is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.889 
everything else as a combined unit is
just<00:02:06.840> water<00:02:07.649> movement<00:02:09.709> so

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
just water movement so

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.240 
just water movement so
took<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> look<00:02:11.379> at<00:02:11.530> all<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.739> parts<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
took a look at all the parts of the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.190 
took a look at all the parts of the
filter<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.730> how<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.090> works<00:02:13.360> we<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:13.900> know<00:02:14.170> that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
filter and how it works we now know that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.380 
filter and how it works we now know that
our<00:02:14.470> filter<00:02:15.010> needs<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.400> turn<00:02:15.610> our<00:02:15.819> tank<00:02:16.090> over

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
our filter needs to turn our tank over

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.350 
our filter needs to turn our tank over
at<00:02:16.480> least<00:02:16.810> four<00:02:17.319> times<00:02:17.620> per<00:02:18.010> hour<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.940> he<00:02:19.120> very

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
at least four times per hour is he very

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.050 
at least four times per hour is he very
important<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.470> how<00:02:21.129> does<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.459> relate<00:02:21.519> in

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
important so how does this relate in

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.020 
important so how does this relate in

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
by name we don't go by price we just

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.080 
by name we don't go by price we just
look<00:02:29.290> at<00:02:29.440> how<00:02:29.860> many<00:02:30.099> times<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.549> can<00:02:30.700> turn<00:02:30.909> our

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
look at how many times it can turn our

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.059 
look at how many times it can turn our
tank<00:02:31.329> over<00:02:31.659> an<00:02:31.750> hour<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.650> all<00:02:32.860> the
