 Hello I am Michelangelo Moggia and this is Analyze a Picture, today I present to you the Mona Lisa by Leonardo, probably the most famous painting in the world, the image is so well known that you risk not appreciating it anymore. 

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:25.915
 Instead it is a very important work because it is the synthesis of the art of Leonardo. 

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:33.350
 Certainly there is a portrait of a woman, made around 1503 and perhaps never finished. 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:44.806
 Leonardo always took it with him and from time to time he added some brushstrokes: so much so that thanks to X-rays it was discovered that under the current version there are three others. 

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:53.412
 The woman portrayed is probably Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco Del Giocondo, and then Monna Lisa called the Mona Lisa. 

00:00:53.412 --> 00:01:06.583
 However, identification is not certain. Giorgio Vasari, the first art historian, speaks about it, who among other things exalts Leonardo's skill in painting the woman's eyebrows, 

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:20.425
 but as you well know it has none. The explanation could however be linked to the fact that Leonardo retouched and modified the painting several times as we have seen. 

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:20.425
 but as you well know it has none. The explanation could however be linked to the fact that Leonardo retouched and modified the painting several times as we have seen. 

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:28.606
 Mona Lisa, or whoever, is sitting three-quarters on a chair, but turns her head frontally towards the viewer: 

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:33.572
 his pose is extremely natural and has nothing artificial or studied. 

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:42.600
 The expression is enigmatic above all because of the slightly hinted smile and the look whose expression is indecipherable. 

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:48.870
 The whole painting is characterized by the technique, typical of Leonardo, of the gradient. 

00:01:48.873 --> 00:02:01.330
 In practice the artist worked by glazing, that is he spread layers of color very diluted one on top of the other, thus obtaining an extremely soft and nuanced painting. 

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:11.400
 This is especially noticeable in the face, whose expression is changeable and if you look at it and regards it several times it appears imperceptibly different. 

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:23.500
 In his treatise on painting, in fact, Leonardo advised painters who had to do a portrait to do it towards evening or on bad weather days 

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:27.330
 when the lights are weaker and the features appear softer. 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:39.490
 Thus he wrote: "I mind in the streets on making the faces of men and women in the evening, when it is bad weather, how much grace and sweetness we see in them." 

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:49.890
 This constitutes a great novelty for the painting of the time: a portrait, like a photograph nowadays stopped the instant, the expression of a moment 

00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:54.680
 Leonardo instead puts on the canvas the time that passes and the changes it brings. 

00:02:54.678 --> 00:03:04.440
 In fact, the Mona Lisa has been a source of inspiration for many successive portraits and is a bit of a prototype of the portrait of the full Renaissance. 

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:06.440
 The most famous example is given by some portraits of Raphael, but there are several other examples. 

00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:21.860
 The landscape behind Monna Lisa, with which the figure is perfectly integrated, is characterized by a shaded, almost foggy atmosphere. 

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:34.490
 Also in this case Leonardo applied his knowledge and the direct observation of nature within the framework. These are things that may seem obvious to us, but at the time they were not at all. 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.710
 You can also find the concept of change due to time here, looking at the jagged rocks of centuries of erosion: 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:54.160
 so here is a comparison, a parallel between the short time with the changes in women's expression and the long time of changes in the environment, of the earth, of the rocks. 

00:03:54.158 --> 00:04:09.950
 Leonardo was the first to put into practice the concept of "aerial perspective": in practice he had noticed that the elements of the landscape, as they are further away, fade, and take on a gray-blue color 

00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:19.640
 the classic example is that of the mountains: the reason is due to the amount of air that is between the observer and the object observed. 

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:30.260
 Look at the rocks behind the Mona Lisa: the closest ones are darker and have a different consistency than the more distant ones that are evanescent. 

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:39.680
 I close with a detail and a curiosity: if you look carefully you will notice that on the two sides of the Mona Lisa you can just see the bases of two columns 

00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:44.020
 surely the woman was sitting in front of a parapet in a lodge. 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:56.770
 The landscape that can be seen from this vantage point could be a glimpse of the Arno valley where there is still a bridge very similar to the one you see in the background 

00:04:56.767 --> 00:05:05.270
 and that Leonardo knew well because he carried out studies on the water basin.
