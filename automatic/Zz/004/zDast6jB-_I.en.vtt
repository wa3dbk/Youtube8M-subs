longhand and every once in a while

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
longhand and every once in a while
you'll<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.049> able<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> write<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> book<00:01:34.890> where<00:01:35.159> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.270 
you'll be able to write a book where it
just<00:01:35.430> flows<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.299> natural<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.799> far<00:01:38.130> as

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just flows and it natural but as far as

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.030 
just flows and it natural but as far as

I can tell about 90% of us need to stop

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.719 
I can tell about 90% of us need to stop
before<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.700> write<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> book<00:01:42.320> slow<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.520> name

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
of one of my books and create a powerful

of<00:01:50.130> reasons<00:01:50.280> why<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.930> lot<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
of reasons why to do it now for a lot of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
of reasons why to do it now for a lot of
us<00:01:52.500> we're<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.799> balk<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:53.790> we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
us we're gonna balk at this because we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
us we're gonna balk at this because we
don't<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> organization<00:01:55.159> we<00:01:56.159> don't

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
don't want the organization we don't

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
don't want the organization we don't
want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.909> stymied<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.229> writing

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
want to be stymied we think that writing

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
want to be stymied we think that writing
a<00:01:58.710> book<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.040> being<00:01:59.430> creative<00:02:00.119> but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
a book is just being creative but

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
a book is just being creative but
actually<00:02:01.170> lots<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.979> times<00:02:02.189> people<00:02:02.610> will<00:02:02.700> hit

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
actually lots of times people will hit

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.850 
actually lots of times people will hit
this<00:02:03.090> thing<00:02:03.149> called<00:02:03.689> writer's<00:02:04.140> block<00:02:04.170> when

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
this thing called writer's block when

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.499 
this thing called writer's block when
they<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.030> good<00:02:06.180> outline

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
they don't have a really good outline

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
they don't have a really good outline
and<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.290> reason<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.520> their

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and the reason is is because their

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.150 
and the reason is is because their
thoughts<00:02:09.450> aren't<00:02:09.690> organized<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.619> that's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
thoughts aren't organized and that's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.270 
thoughts aren't organized and that's
probably<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> number<00:02:11.910> one

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
probably one of the number one

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.770 
probably one of the number one
things<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.700> stalls<00:02:13.030> people<00:02:13.450> from<00:02:13.600> right

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
things that stalls people from right

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.050 
things that stalls people from right
running<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.319> book<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.430> number-one<00:02:15.790> thing<00:02:16.000> that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
running a book the number-one thing that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.120 
running a book the number-one thing that
I've<00:02:16.569> seen<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.050> my<00:02:17.200> work<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.680> helping<00:02:17.950> people

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
I've seen in my work and helping people

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.220 
I've seen in my work and helping people
to<00:02:18.490> get<00:02:18.730> ready<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.090> write<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.270> book<00:02:19.569> is<00:02:19.780> that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
to get ready to write a book is that

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.500 
to get ready to write a book is that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
something like for a number of years I

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.640 
something like for a number of years I
had<00:04:44.580> no<00:04:44.820> idea<00:04:45.210> why<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.570> was<00:04:45.750> finally<00:04:46.230> out<00:04:46.530> of

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
had no idea why I was finally out of

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.550 
had no idea why I was finally out of
control<00:04:47.040> into<00:04:47.340> depression<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.270> had<00:04:48.690> no<00:04:48.900> faith<00:04:49.230> I

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560
