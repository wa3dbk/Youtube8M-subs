00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
been going I did not do too good after

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010 
been going I did not do too good after
my<00:01:07.010> second<00:01:07.520> round<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.180> ate<00:01:08.450> something<00:01:08.810> I

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
my second round and I ate something I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.870 
my second round and I ate something I
shouldn't<00:01:09.409> have<00:01:09.620> like<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.310> first<00:01:10.580> day

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
shouldn't have like on the first day

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.300 
shouldn't have like on the first day
that<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:11.240> should<00:01:11.540> have<00:01:11.659> been<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.930> Phase<00:01:12.200> two<00:01:12.310> and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
that I should have been on Phase two and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.920 
that I should have been on Phase two and
I<00:01:13.400> think<00:01:13.460> that's<00:01:13.820> what<00:01:14.030> really<00:01:14.150> slowed<00:01:14.720> me

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
I think that's what really slowed me

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.130 
I think that's what really slowed me
down<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.920> then<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:16.970> didn't<00:01:17.240> do<00:01:17.299> my<00:01:17.330> steak<00:01:17.810> days

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
down and then I didn't do my steak days

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.260 
down and then I didn't do my steak days
on<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.409> day<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:18.650> supposed<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:19.790> that<00:01:19.820> was

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
on the day I was supposed to so that was

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.609 
on the day I was supposed to so that was
then<00:01:20.510> this<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:20.810> now<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:22.090> so<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.119> ended<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.619> 151

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
then this is now and so I ended it 151

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.109 
then this is now and so I ended it 151
and<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.700> had<00:01:26.350> all<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.770> day<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.430> then<00:01:28.790> all

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
and then I had all that day and then all

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.109

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
then I went down to 150 point six but

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.570 
then I went down to 150 point six but
that's<00:01:35.600> not<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.990> number<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:36.290> counts<00:01:36.770> so

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
that's not the number that counts so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.679 
that's not the number that counts so

weeks i didn't have to have a steak day
but<00:02:52.390> i<00:02:52.420> did<00:02:52.750> find<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.430> one<00:02:54.430> day<00:02:54.610> i<00:02:54.640> ate<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
but i did find that one day i ate a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300 
but i did find that one day i ate a
bunch<00:02:55.269> of<00:02:55.420> almonds<00:02:55.989> i<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.890> better<00:02:57.220> on

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
bunch of almonds i do better on

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.550 
bunch of almonds i do better on
macadamia<00:02:58.090> nuts<00:02:58.269> than<00:02:58.480> almonds<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.440> I'm

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
macadamia nuts than almonds but what I'm

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.800 
macadamia nuts than almonds but what I'm
finding<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.220> with<00:03:00.549> nuts<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.090> just<00:03:01.330> hard<00:03:01.660> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
finding is with nuts it's just hard to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.809 
finding is with nuts it's just hard to
limit<00:03:02.230> yourself<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.160> handful

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
limit yourself to that little handful

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.750 
limit yourself to that little handful
because<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:05.890> can<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:06.400> need<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.549> little

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
because how can you just need a little

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.370 
because how can you just need a little
handful<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.299> nuts<00:03:07.510> especially<00:03:07.750> when<00:03:08.230> they're

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
handful and nuts especially when they're

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.740 
handful and nuts especially when they're
macadamia<00:03:08.950> nuts<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.239> said<00:03:10.299> I'd<00:03:10.600> do

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
macadamia nuts but like I said I'd do

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.449 
macadamia nuts but like I said I'd do
better<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:13.590> macadamia<00:03:14.590> nuts<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.040> almonds

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
better on on macadamia nuts and almonds
