00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.610
 the button show desktop but no longer 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.910
 it's visible in windows 8 it still exists 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.459
 what that button does is hide all 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.329
 the windows to only show the 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 desk 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:16.129
 remember that the desk is the area 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.990
 that is shown just above the bar 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.509
 of tasks including also the bar 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.910
 tasks may be part of the 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.580
 desk here I have several windows 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.609
 that I'm going to minimize what you're seeing 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.400
 right now on the screen is what you 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.149
 known as desk includes the background 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.300
 of the screen the shortcuts or 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.760
 folders that it contains in this area as well 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.949
 like the taskbar in windows 7 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.410
 we remember this show button 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.170
 desk because it appeared right at a 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.780
 side of the clock in this area where I have 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.660
 the cursor right now in fact what 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.210
 has happened to leave it for a moment 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.179
 from him this is precisely what he does 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.710
 the show desk button although it has 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.989
 two behaviors like what you just 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.000
 see the first of them is precisely 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.830
 that when you leave the cursor for a 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
 instant above this area 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.110
 although it no longer looks like a button like 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.910
 it appeared or as it appears in windows 7 still 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.500
 is still here let's say the button 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.620
 now it is invisible to show the desktop 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.190
 then what you are going to do is minimize 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.440
 and temporarily hide the windows that 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.810
 are currently covering what 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.270
 he is covering the desk he hides 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.730
 temporarily as you are seeing in 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.890
 this case is using the feature 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.950
 of pitch that what it does is make 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 transparent the windows but the other 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.500
 option is to completely hide everything 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.660
 and do not show the rectangles that you are 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.850
 watching and that's only by clicking 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.800
 I'm going to click and see how it has 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.500
 hidden all the windows 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.050
 this is to quickly focus or 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.290
 find a desktop shortcut 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.050
 once we locate it we can open 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.600
 said shortcut and then return 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.540
 all the windows to how they were 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.670
 previously pressing again 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.580
 this area that I repeat is not seen 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.170
 absolutely nothing but if you click 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.599
 to happen what you are seeing 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.849
 with clicking or holding the cursor 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.670
 over this area is that by leaving the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.980
 cursor only shows the desktop 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.830
 but if we remove it, they come back 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.349
 the windows so it's not very useful that 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.540
 let's say if we need to click on 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.520
 a direct access because of any 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
 way the windows are going to continue 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.560
 covering the entire desk so what 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.140
 better to click and then locate 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.140
 the shortcut to open the program 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.900
 or the folder that we are looking for this 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.390
 is what makes the button show the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.830
 desk hides the windows 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.100
 temporarily to see what's behind 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.489
 of them and by pressing again said 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.610
 button 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.600
 all those windows return to their 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.600
 normal position
