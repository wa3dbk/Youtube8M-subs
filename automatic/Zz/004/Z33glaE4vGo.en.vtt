have<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.140> native<00:02:17.530> image<00:02:17.860> editor<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.550> that's<00:02:18.850> why

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
have a native image editor so that's why

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.460 
have a native image editor so that's why
you<00:02:19.060> need<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.240> copy<00:02:19.450> into<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.750> computer<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> um

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you need to copy into a computer so um

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.910 
you need to copy into a computer so um
to<00:02:23.470> find<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.920> files<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.550> go<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.880> UM<00:02:25.920> user

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to find the files you can go to UM user

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.310 
to find the files you can go to UM user
and<00:02:27.280> then<00:02:27.550> applications<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.540> then<00:02:29.200> there

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
and then applications and then there

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.890 
and then applications and then there
will<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.530> bunch<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.890> weird<00:02:30.180> names<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.570> then

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
will be a bunch of weird names and then

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.810 
will be a bunch of weird names and then
after<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.010> double<00:02:33.370> click<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.790> and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
after that you can double click it and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.820 
after that you can double click it and
it<00:02:34.000> should<00:02:34.180> say<00:02:34.420> something<00:02:34.690> like<00:02:34.840> for<00:02:35.740> example

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it should say something like for example

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.550 
it should say something like for example
iBooks<00:02:36.490> app<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.330> then<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.630> can<00:02:37.780> press<00:02:37.900> f5<00:02:38.320> to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
iBooks app and then you can press f5 to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.610 
iBooks app and then you can press f5 to
copy<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.950> folder<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.900> copies<00:02:41.140> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
copy the folder and then it copies and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.600 
copy the folder and then it copies and
then<00:02:42.480> yeah<00:02:43.980> sometimes<00:02:44.980> it'll<00:02:45.340> give<00:02:45.490> you

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
then yeah sometimes it'll give you
