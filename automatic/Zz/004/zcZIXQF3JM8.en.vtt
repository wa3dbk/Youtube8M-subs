texture<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.909> continued<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> I've

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
texture I've continued that I've

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
texture I've continued that I've
actually<00:01:49.020> replaced<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.740> cobblestone<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
actually replaced a cobblestone that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.030 
actually replaced a cobblestone that
comes<00:01:50.790> with<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> Crescent<00:01:51.630> route<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.409> extend

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
comes with the Crescent route to extend

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.940 
comes with the Crescent route to extend
that<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> sort<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.350> tie<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that down and sort of tie that in so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.990 
that down and sort of tie that in so
that<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:57.200> sort<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.259> uniform<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.799> shape

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that it's all sort of uniform in shape

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.440 
that it's all sort of uniform in shape
again<00:02:00.439> here<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.770> groundwork<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.610> mud<00:02:02.880> track

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
again here the groundwork the mud track

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.620 
again here the groundwork the mud track
marks<00:02:04.700> tree<00:02:05.700> stumps<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.180> trees<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> are

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
marks tree stumps are is trees that are

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.819 
marks tree stumps are is trees that are
on<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.590> whether<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
want to put them on or not they will

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.970 
want to put them on or not they will
come<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:11.330> again<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:13.050> black<00:02:13.260> patches

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
come with it again the black patches

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.710 
come with it again the black patches
i've<00:02:14.069> done<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.610> i've<00:02:14.790> done<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.390> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
i've done here is i've done that so that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.839 
i've done here is i've done that so that
my<00:02:15.900> basis<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.440> blend<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.830> with<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.069> board<00:02:17.280> but

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
my basis can blend in with the board but

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.000 
my basis can blend in with the board but
i<00:02:17.909> will<00:02:18.239> include<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:19.140> somebody<00:02:19.530> does<00:02:19.739> decide

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
i will include if somebody does decide

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.339 
i will include if somebody does decide
to<00:02:20.069> pick<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.519> i'll<00:02:20.760> include<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.349> base

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
to pick this up i'll include the base

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.430 
to pick this up i'll include the base
flocking<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> all<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.629> have<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.080> really<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
flocking so all you have to do really is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.339 
flocking so all you have to do really is
just<00:02:25.830> apply<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.310> PVA<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.060> patch<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.140> right

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
just apply the PVA and patch that right

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.470 
just apply the PVA and patch that right
over<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.830> will<00:02:28.950> look<00:02:29.129> identical<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
over and it will look identical to the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.119 
over and it will look identical to the
grass<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:30.900> already<00:02:31.140> around<00:02:31.200> there<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
grass it's already around there so it's

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.080 
grass it's already around there so it's
very<00:02:32.280> easy<00:02:32.519> fix<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.700> again<00:02:35.970> it's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
very easy fix and it's like again it's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.430 
very easy fix and it's like again it's
not<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> fix<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.019> something<00:02:37.349> if

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
not really a fix it's just something if

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.009 
not really a fix it's just something if
you<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.700> spaces<00:02:39.390> available<00:02:39.629> if

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
you want to have the spaces available if

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.660 
you want to have the spaces available if
not<00:02:40.410> maybe<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.709> want<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> cover<00:02:41.099> up<00:02:41.310> some<00:02:41.489> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
not maybe you want to cover up some and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.160 
not maybe you want to cover up some and
leave<00:02:41.790> some<00:02:42.030> that's<00:02:42.239> totally<00:02:42.629> up<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> so

off so if you want to have a large space
say<00:03:50.310> you're<00:03:50.459> doing<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.669> tank<00:03:50.910> force<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.329> you

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
say you're doing a tank force and you

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.729 
say you're doing a tank force and you
don't<00:03:51.569> want<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.810> have<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.049> church<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.530> do

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
don't want to have the church but you do

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.589 
don't want to have the church but you do
like<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.040> courtyard<00:03:53.430> idea<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.450> that

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
like the courtyard idea you have that

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.400 
like the courtyard idea you have that
space<00:03:54.840> available<00:03:55.459> if<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:57.540> want<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.019> use<00:03:58.169> this

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
space available if you want to use this

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.300 
space available if you want to use this
on<00:03:59.090> an<00:04:00.090> existing<00:04:00.359> table<00:04:00.810> top<00:04:00.989> there<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.129> go<00:04:02.250> to

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
on an existing table top there you go to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.280 
on an existing table top there you go to
slow<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:02.819> down<00:04:02.900> everything's<00:04:03.900> been<00:04:04.079> black

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
slow that down everything's been black

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.400 
slow that down everything's been black
coated<00:04:04.680> out<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.069> there's<00:04:05.609> no<00:04:05.790> sort<00:04:06.389> of<00:04:06.510> areas

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
coated out so there's no sort of areas

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.710 
coated out so there's no sort of areas
that<00:04:07.560> are<00:04:07.620> left<00:04:07.799> unfinished<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.690> is

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
that are left unfinished so this is

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449 
that are left unfinished so this is
versatile<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.739> can<00:04:10.799> pop<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.099> off<00:04:11.340> your

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
least you guys can pick up two awesome

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.560 
least you guys can pick up two awesome
buildings<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.990> some<00:04:55.139> platforms<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.639> the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
buildings and some platforms so the the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.180 
buildings and some platforms so the the
baseboards<00:04:58.110> are<00:04:58.169> dis<00:04:58.350> gravy<00:04:58.590> at<00:04:58.800> that<00:04:58.949> point

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
baseboards are dis gravy at that point

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.730 
baseboards are dis gravy at that point
so<00:04:59.310> they<00:04:59.789> are<00:04:59.910> magnetized<00:05:00.449> as<00:05:00.630> well<00:05:00.810> i<00:05:01.050> should

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
so they are magnetized as well i should

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.560 
so they are magnetized as well i should
quickly<00:05:02.490> show<00:05:02.789> that<00:05:02.970> while<00:05:03.090> i<00:05:03.150> got<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.360> couple

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
quickly show that while i got a couple

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.570 
quickly show that while i got a couple
minutes<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:03.990> video<00:05:04.250> left<00:05:05.250> here<00:05:05.840> did<00:05:06.840> promise

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
minutes of video left here did promise

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.400 
minutes of video left here did promise
gunbarrel<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.820> would<00:05:08.940> show<00:05:09.150> him<00:05:09.199> how<00:05:10.199> this

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
gunbarrel I would show him how this

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.980 
gunbarrel I would show him how this
comes<00:05:10.620> apart<00:05:10.889> so<00:05:11.360> here's<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.600> seam<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:12.960> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
comes apart so here's the seam in the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.240 
comes apart so here's the seam in the
center<00:05:13.350> it's<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.560> little<00:05:13.740> bit<00:05:13.830> difficult<00:05:13.979> with

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
center it's a little bit difficult with

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.029 
center it's a little bit difficult with
it<00:05:14.810> camera<00:05:15.810> in<00:05:15.870> my<00:05:15.960> hand<00:05:16.169> but<00:05:16.350> I'm<00:05:16.650> gonna<00:05:16.860> see

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
it camera in my hand but I'm gonna see

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.610 
it camera in my hand but I'm gonna see
if<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.220> can<00:05:17.400> separate<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.240> like<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.199> said<00:05:19.440> it's

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
if I can separate this like I said it's

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.490 
if I can separate this like I said it's
it<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.669> magnetized<00:05:23.660> this<00:05:24.660> point<00:05:24.900> I'm<00:05:25.289> going<00:05:25.380> to

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
it is magnetized this point I'm going to

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.590 
it is magnetized this point I'm going to
set<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:25.800> down<00:05:25.949> I<00:05:26.010> cannot<00:05:26.370> do<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.610> was<00:05:26.699> 18<00:05:27.030> it's

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
set this down I cannot do it was 18 it's

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.930 
set this down I cannot do it was 18 it's
magnetized<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.380> much<00:05:28.590> so<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.520> guys<00:05:29.699> can

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
magnetized that much so you guys can

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.650 
magnetized that much so you guys can
