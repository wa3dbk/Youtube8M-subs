speed their new aluminum system that we

made<00:00:37.579> it<00:00:37.670> all<00:00:37.789> possible<00:00:37.930> without<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:39.109> I

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
made it all possible without that I

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:40.810 
made it all possible without that I
don't<00:00:39.649> think<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.219> would<00:00:40.309> have<00:00:40.399> ever<00:00:40.520> made<00:00:40.699> it

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
don't think it would have ever made it

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.279 
don't think it would have ever made it
down<00:00:40.969> through<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.210> frame<00:00:41.420> in<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.899> back<00:00:42.079> we're

link<00:00:44.120> system<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:44.780> we<00:00:44.870> have<00:00:45.019> four<00:00:45.230> corners<00:00:45.620> of

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
link system so we have four corners of

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.380 
link system so we have four corners of
all<00:00:45.829> coil<00:00:46.129> over<00:00:46.370> shocks<00:00:46.399> everything's<00:00:47.149> fully

all coil over shocks everything's fully
adjustable<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.289> don't<00:00:49.280> think<00:00:49.399> we're<00:00:49.489> going<00:00:49.579> to

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
adjustable I don't think we're going to

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.009 
adjustable I don't think we're going to
have<00:00:49.730> any<00:00:49.940> issues<00:00:50.149> sticking<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:50.750> thing<00:00:50.930> in
