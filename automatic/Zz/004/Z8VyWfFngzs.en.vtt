00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.060
 friends next to me is moscow 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.690
 five duo player commentator good 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.620
 just dude cool there he has a beard with 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.260
 beard say people win come on 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.730
 back a little bit back to the cg in Russia 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 managed before the final let's go back well 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.529
 as we remember, will rule of course 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.179
 could have been better but that was enough 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 What are your plans for next ? 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.219
 did you train for this on the bootcamp yes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.380
 seriously from to 1 our goal was to 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.629
 the arrival of botkin with whom would this cg 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.590
 accordingly we trained for this 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.170
 the game was prepared by some developments 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.570
 as if they were doing in the end 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.550
 well won further we had a goal 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.149
 is it like go to speak 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.180
 Starladdera she was in principle and more 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.280
 As goal precisely gaining experience on Lan 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 games that we have the team we have but you in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.609
 mostly we have four people wrong 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.150
 literally their first lan 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.920
 serious well experience as it says 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 herself had her mouth full of experience with us 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 Now there is further the aim of us bcg 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.090
 accordingly we will train 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.640
 then also on butkempah well, it is still 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.470
 not clear because we first need 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.750
 come get some rest 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.820
 there think collectively what we 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.630
 We will do further and there will already be 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 visible and if not secret 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.159
 he is where you are with us in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.869
 Moscow on near Moscow more precisely it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.909
 the cottage is fresh air everything is very easy then 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.369
 there is uses so to speak and for 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 health and for a hobby it turns out to play 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 yes with health benefits said of course 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.829
 even doing something besides dota me 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.540
 know you 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 stream doin on though it is also in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 dota principle can be a sport study 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 work you know how are you behind the question even 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.890
 salto load over error zadrot but 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.780
 how do you know doing how to build 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.769
 only dota and girl and girls too 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.959
 what for / okay by the way how is she 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.760
 ok applies i know that dota here 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 as for me this is one of those 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.370
 laborious we are hard disciplines 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.380
 requires a lot of time but in general 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.700
 yes, well, you know, let's say so 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.860
 to put it mildly 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 good because she seems to be herself now 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.870
 sits there and plays for the female team 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 here she plays like they recently 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.200
 arrived too type the first lan and very 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.480
 just wanted to look at all this 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.760
 In general, it does not normally apply 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.610
 complains about nothing but this is important as you 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.250
 do you think anyone speaks this starladdar 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.069
 well, I think it's pretty obvious 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.930
 favorite of course on wine 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.060
 You know, many are probably already tired of what 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.069
 not that ate pretty boring then what 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.200
 okay go to the game all NAVINA 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.630
 wines so I somehow give my 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.739
 preferences a little more for mauses 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.630
 probably for mauzov 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.299
 well for the muse and here they are the final 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.480
 You generally watched the game against the Mouse 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.060
 empire when they played yet top 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.280
 the grid honestly, no, did not work 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.109
 a lot of people were jam 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.850
 wanted to come see houses in 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.470
 calm but there too 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.040
 problems were with the internet and not yet 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.250
 turned out the way a considerable course 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.109
 dj dj dj everyone is known as 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.690
 Of course, under the clan of that mouse to the lesson 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.959
 said they had a couple more tournaments 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.560
 under the clan such a Judy will come out 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.260
 Now 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.989
 the empire in the bottom grid losers won 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.010
 we're just at the bottom grid lol at the bottom 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.500
 the grid they won 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.909
 pulse and now according to them 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.819
 there will be another meeting 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.150
 that is, you are like you think 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.890
 all the same will be rival on and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.659
 grand masterbook finale you know pretty 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.280
 difficult question so far as you can see how 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.610
 guys can play on lan that is like 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.900
 they can gather at the right moment and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.479
 playing for the maximum is very difficult 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.530
 say here but i know that in empire is very 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.960
 many young players have a scandal one 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.539
 of which which performs very well in 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.889
 online but I heard something like that 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.139
 currency on the scene when they were played in 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.600
 him a little failed but that's understandable 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.180
 how many viewers play against 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.949
 this is all chanting money money 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.020
 Of course it's hard to play there 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:42.970
 especially for a newbie that ’s not less 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.410
 mdr are very strong on at least 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.729
 There are many different online 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:54.940
 strategies can therefore 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.260
 principle could understand you stream 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.330
 doing more than the main game 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.419
 I like to work out sometimes streams is me 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.590
 I think it's ok of course when to where 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.139
 same today without it 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.010
 but this is well , we are gaining a little where to me 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:15.099
 give yes to you regarding the future 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.780
 some kind of development you play mostly 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:21.870
 desktops with anyone but yes there you greetings 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.270
 handed turns to bed you 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.590
 it is generally very, very sad indeed 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.650
 In fact, success seems to play if there is 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.650
 time to come in but for the sake of interest 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.599
 there is howo zadrotstvo no there 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.400
 just wanting to get into some tops 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.580
 I stupidly like the game as if pretty 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.500
 on and updated and complex and how would 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.240
 requires concentration i mean i don't know 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.210
 just like for common development 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.250
 we should play a little bit so we 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.240
 what about streams do you plan somehow 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.870
 develop here 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.270
 singsing to the main dandy like 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.770
 dota's top streamers are great 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.349
 the number of viewers, respectively, money 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.750
 you too have how easy it all goes 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.300
 in succession or some plans you can 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.419
 be on the development of their broadcasts well 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.780
 you know I would have my main goal now 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:17.050
 this is dota since i'm on the team then i 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.349
 completely surrender to this already 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.960
 mediocre doing well 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.949
 full course because I can not now 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.449
 devote so much time to development 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:26.960
 how much is needed to really well 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.289
 develop 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.599
 but I hope I’ll still pay 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.360
 time and strictly speaking stream 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:38.270
 Opportunities because also 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:45.319
 just for the sake of money let's just say it 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:47.720
 as if for myself for the audience well I think 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.800
 what will we finish with it if it is cronix 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.800
 of course fit the camera
