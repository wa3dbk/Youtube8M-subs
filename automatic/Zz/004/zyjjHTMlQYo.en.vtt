00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
intensity match intensity and ultimately

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.430

in 2010 when I've got to play for an
invitational<00:04:03.940> team<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.360> likes<00:04:04.540> of

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
invitational team to the likes of

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.610 
invitational team to the likes of
Michaelis<00:04:05.590> gars<00:04:06.660> gnarly<00:04:07.660> Burford<00:04:08.440> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
Michaelis gars gnarly Burford and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.949 
Michaelis gars gnarly Burford and
Clairol<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.150> think<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.570> was<00:04:10.660> just<00:04:10.810> from

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
Clairol and and I think it was just from

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.420 
Clairol and and I think it was just from
playing<00:04:11.170> from<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.560> being<00:04:11.920> in<00:04:12.040> Dubai<00:04:12.280> and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
playing from that and being in Dubai and

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.920 
playing from that and being in Dubai and
seeing<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:13.060> birds<00:04:13.239> about<00:04:13.420> sevens<00:04:13.750> was

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
seeing what the birds about sevens was

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.870 
seeing what the birds about sevens was
kind<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.890> give<00:04:14.980> me<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.160> love<00:04:15.310> for<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.610> then<00:04:15.700> I

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
kind of give me the love for and then I

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.969 
kind of give me the love for and then I
came<00:04:16.000> back<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.600> got<00:04:16.930> involved<00:04:17.500> in<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.769> squad

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
came back and got involved in the squad

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.920 
came back and got involved in the squad
and<00:04:18.130> again<00:04:19.000> Dubai<00:04:19.269> was<00:04:19.419> my<00:04:19.540> first<00:04:19.720> tournament

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
and again Dubai was my first tournament

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.020 
and again Dubai was my first tournament
last<00:04:20.200> year<00:04:20.380> for<00:04:20.830> England<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.459> then<00:04:21.580> obviously

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
last year for England and then obviously

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.380 
last year for England and then obviously
with<00:04:22.300> Hong<00:04:22.450> Kong<00:04:22.630> this<00:04:23.050> time<00:04:23.260> last<00:04:23.470> year<00:04:23.590> was

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
with Hong Kong this time last year was

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.940 
with Hong Kong this time last year was
fantastic<00:04:25.390> my<00:04:25.419> favorite<00:04:26.320> one<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.500> date<00:04:26.680> and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
fantastic my favorite one to date and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.740 
fantastic my favorite one to date and
just<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.669> then<00:04:27.760> it's<00:04:27.880> just<00:04:28.000> built<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:28.600> I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
just and then it's just built and I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.550 
just and then it's just built and I
think<00:04:28.900> with<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.080> sevens

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
think with the sevens

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.740 
think with the sevens
they<00:04:30.070> just<00:04:30.220> know<00:04:30.340> keep<00:04:30.490> building<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:31.150> then<00:04:31.330> at

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
they just know keep building and then at

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.810 
they just know keep building and then at
the<00:04:31.840> end<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.500> Rio<00:04:32.650> 2016<00:04:33.280> which<00:04:33.669> will

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
the end of this the Rio 2016 which will

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.610 
the end of this the Rio 2016 which will
obviously<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.780> icing<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.140> cake<00:04:35.229> as<00:04:35.500> oh

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
obviously be the icing on the cake as oh

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.450 
obviously be the icing on the cake as oh

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
think we've both have to take massive

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.260 
think we've both have to take massive
kind<00:04:50.140> of<00:04:50.200> decisions<00:04:50.560> in<00:04:50.680> our<00:04:50.800> careers<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.370> was<00:04:52.210> a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
kind of decisions in our careers I was a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.500 
kind of decisions in our careers I was a
teacher<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:52.900> my<00:04:53.800> school<00:04:54.340> weren't<00:04:55.300> able<00:04:55.390> to

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
teacher and my school weren't able to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.120 
teacher and my school weren't able to
support<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.110> part-time<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:56.800> I'd<00:04:56.919> take<00:04:57.070> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
support the part-time so I'd take a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.310 
support the part-time so I'd take a
sabbatical<00:04:57.340> leave<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.030> which<00:04:58.750> mean<00:04:59.020> picking

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
sabbatical leave and which mean picking

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.590 
sabbatical leave and which mean picking
up<00:04:59.470> supply<00:04:59.770> work<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:00.400> financially<00:05:01.390> it's<00:05:01.479> been

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
up supply work so financially it's been

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.280 
up supply work so financially it's been
a<00:05:01.630> big<00:05:01.810> blow<00:05:02.910> ultimately<00:05:03.910> it's<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.600> six<00:05:04.870> six

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
a big blow ultimately it's is six six

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.350
