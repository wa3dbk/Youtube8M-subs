00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:31.260
 so it's written a2p space tr to il er 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 so even if it has to take an edge 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 you write it is because 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.829
 otherwise it will mark you as the confession that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.930
