 opportunity we will have a very project 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.170
 entertained here in your web space hands 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.870
 to the work 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.190
 as a child who has not wanted to paint on his 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.500
 wall 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.450
 now let's learn how to make a 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.460
 Simple and practical step on the wall 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.930
 using paint and displays because the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.800
 decoration utility and fun 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.800
 They go hand in hand 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.250
 the materials that we are going to use to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.420
 this project are the following 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 spray paint 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 wall paste 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.910
 choose water 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.410
 blue masking tape 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.330
 a dust mask 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.680
 and a flat plastic tray for the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.680
 dilution 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 the only tool that we are going to 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.170
 use is a plate called steel 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170
 stainless 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.330
 do not forget to keep the windows well 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.250
 open and the ventilated place of this 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 way will you avoid breathing the paint you 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.840
 help speed up the drying process 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.370
 the first step is to prepare the pasta 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.050
 Open the wall paste carefully and dilute 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.330
 the conagua in the container no longer 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.040
 remember that for a gallon of pasta 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.040
 you will need a liter of paint 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 yes 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.110
 the second step is to mark the space 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 where the blackboard will go with a more than tape 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.310
 for wall this tape leaves no traces and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.150
 will easily leave the wall without 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.150
 mistreat painting 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.800
 the third step is in passing the wall catches 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.750
 a little wall paste and place it on 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.640
 the flat iron then begins to cover 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 the whole area where the blackboard 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.940
 have patience a surface should be left 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.130
 totally flat and uniform 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.470
 the pressure you make on the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.690
 moment of filling and if there is any 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.560
 you can remove it and then use it 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.560
 to move to some areas 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.319
 When the pasta has dried choose the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 wall carefully without pressing much 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.440
 before the open windows and it's a 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.440
 mask to protect you from dust 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.700
 and the fifth step is to mark the wall 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.700

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.970
 Y 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.800
 the sixth step is to apply three layers 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.270
 additional paint but remember that 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.740
 you must do it only when the layer 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.740
