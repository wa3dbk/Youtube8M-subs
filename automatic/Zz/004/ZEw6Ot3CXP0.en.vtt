00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
that since it's bundled together it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.639 
that since it's bundled together it
shouldn't<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.600> trying<00:01:57.780> extra<00:01:58.320> hundred

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
shouldn't be trying extra hundred

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that's okay because if you think about

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.940 
that's okay because if you think about
it<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.750> PlayStation<00:02:04.290> 4<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.920> a

it the PlayStation 4 is going to have a
camera<00:02:05.189> feature<00:02:05.520> too<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.360> not<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
camera feature too but it's not going to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
camera feature too but it's not going to
be<00:02:06.990> required<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> sale<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> console

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
be required with the sale of the console

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
be required with the sale of the console
it's<00:02:08.879> something<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.509> pick<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.840> at

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's something that you can pick up at

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.260 
it's something that you can pick up at
the<00:02:10.259> store<00:02:10.590> separately<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.700> believe<00:02:12.060> it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the store separately and I believe it's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.570 
the store separately and I believe it's
going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.569> retail<00:02:12.959> for<00:02:13.170> around

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
going to retail for around

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.020 
going to retail for around
sixty<00:02:13.820> dollars<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:16.010> hundred<00:02:16.640> dollar<00:02:16.760> price

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
sixty dollars so a hundred dollar price

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.220 
sixty dollars so a hundred dollar price
tag<00:02:17.270> that's<00:02:17.450> still<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> little<00:02:17.870> bit<00:02:18.020> tough<00:02:18.200> to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
tag that's still a little bit tough to

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.370 
tag that's still a little bit tough to
overcome<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:19.040> some<00:02:19.280> people<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:21.350> think

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
overcome for some people and I think

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.380 
overcome for some people and I think
that<00:02:21.770> will<00:02:21.920> hurt<00:02:22.130> their<00:02:22.310> cells<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.670> little<00:02:23.180> bit

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
that will hurt their cells a little bit

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
that will hurt their cells a little bit
but<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:24.950> too<00:02:25.130> bad<00:02:25.370> because

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
but it's not going to be too bad because

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.000 
but it's not going to be too bad because
if<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.150> remember<00:02:26.360> when<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.020> ps3<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.620> xbox

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
if you remember when the ps3 and xbox

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.910 
if you remember when the ps3 and xbox
360<00:02:28.610> were<00:02:28.820> announced<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.810> ps3<00:02:30.380> was<00:02:30.530> announced

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
360 were announced the ps3 was announced

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.050 
360 were announced the ps3 was announced
at<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> hundred<00:02:31.220> dollars<00:02:31.550> higher<00:02:31.700> than<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
at a hundred dollars higher than the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.940 
at a hundred dollars higher than the
xbox<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> course<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.260> had<00:02:33.410> another

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
xbox and of course it had another

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.620 
xbox and of course it had another
version<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.580> ps3<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:35.090> was<00:02:35.210> even<00:02:35.330> more

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
version of the ps3 that was even more

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.410 
version of the ps3 that was even more
expensive<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.380> had<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> bigger<00:02:36.740> hard<00:02:37.010> drive

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
expensive that had a bigger hard drive

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.180 
expensive that had a bigger hard drive
but<00:02:38.420> overall<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.960> don't<00:02:39.650> think<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.010> going<00:02:40.130> to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
but overall I don't think it's going to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.530 
but overall I don't think it's going to
be<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> huge<00:02:40.610> deal<00:02:40.760> because<00:02:40.970> people<00:02:41.450> have

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
be a huge deal because people have

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.810 
be a huge deal because people have
fallen<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.990> love<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.230> Xbox<00:02:42.650> Live<00:02:42.920> they<00:02:43.640> know

fallen in love with Xbox Live they know

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.460 
fallen in love with Xbox Live they know
what<00:02:44.000> they<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.960> there's<00:02:45.230> going<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.440> be

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
controller and my controller actually

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.660 
controller and my controller actually
just<00:03:54.470> sits<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.709> my<00:03:54.830> desk<00:03:54.860> anyways<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.519> don't

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
just sits on my desk anyways I don't

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.930 
just sits on my desk anyways I don't
ever<00:03:55.820> pick<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.060> up<00:03:56.330> so<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:58.640> could<00:03:58.790> be<00:03:58.850> an

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
ever pick it up so that could be an

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.310 
ever pick it up so that could be an
issue<00:03:59.060> for<00:03:59.269> me<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:03:59.840> probably<00:03:59.959> going<00:04:00.230> to

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
issue for me so I'm probably going to

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.160 
issue for me so I'm probably going to
wait<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.709> x1<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.370> wait<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:02.840> know<00:04:02.959> for

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
wait for the x1 and wait you know for

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.690 
wait for the x1 and wait you know for
initial<00:04:03.470> reviews<00:04:03.860> after<00:04:04.070> it's<00:04:04.340> been<00:04:04.489> out<00:04:04.670> for
