00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.069
 Toyota genuine hood stripe attachment Please prepare tools, etc. required before work 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.619
 Let's get ready before installation 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:24.990
 Contamination of the mounting surface of the seat as preparation 1 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.990
 Please surely wiped grease from water, such as in a white gasoline 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.350
 Remove the garnish behind the hood 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.149
 Paste Yo San Tape on fender bumper around hood 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.500
 Next install the fender projector for fender protection 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.570
 Hold the cloth etc. in the lock part of the hood and fix it in half open condition 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.570
 This completes preparation for installation 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.149
 I will begin installation work 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:46.350
 A plenty of neutral detergent-containing aqueous solution is applied to the front of the hood 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.350
 Please adjust the concentration of detergent referring to the point you see 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 Peel off the release paper Turn the sheet 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:04.250
 Spray the zenzai on the adhesive surface 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.250
 Please do this work on the work bench with two people to prevent me and the seat 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.600
 Please put on the hood with the adhesive side of the sheet down 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:26.400
 The front mark on the sheet is behind the mark 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:31.159
 Align to the center of the t mark room mirror 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.159
 It is the point that this work is also done by two people 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:42.799
 Using a skin child, crimp from the center of the hood to the outside 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:45.920
 At this time, if the detergent remains between the sheet and the hood, you will have a blister afterward 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.270
 By applying a force to pull out firmly the detergent 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.410
 c We will be in close contact with the hood 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:58.700
 The point is to keep the felt part of the squeegee firmly wet 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:03.550
 Squeegee becomes more slippery and work efficiency increases 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.550
 It also prevents scratches from frictional heat 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:17.850
 As you can slack at the corners and edges of the hood, you can tension while warming the sheet with a dryer 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.850
 It adheres so that it does not enter 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:30.140
 Please be sure to use a household dry plan 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.560
 When using an industrial dryer, the temperature may be too high, which may cause sheet breakage or burns. 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.560
 It will also be 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:44.060
 A large portion of the runoff is pulled while warming the sheet with a dryer 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.060
 And crimp with a squeegee from taking the lawn stretched out sheet 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:55.049
 When adhesion of the circumference is bad when the temperature is low, etc., water is sprayed to wash away the detergent 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.049
 Please let me adhere 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:06.480
 The moisture in and out air gun or air in front of the last step to involve as subsequent point 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.680
 It is important that it flows exactly 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 We can prevent moisture remaining after being rolled up in the work 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:32.050
 Because there is slack in the corner of the cutting hood around the seat 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:37.650
 Cut the film about 20 mm from the hood bridge using a scissors cutter 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.650
 In this way, please attach the corner r with mother 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.570
 When using a tape or the like as a standard of 20 mm, the whole is cut on average 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.570
 can 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.139
 Please have a guide tape is peeled off when you're done is cut 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:10.200
 Let's ski while warming the suite with the dryer s 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.200
 It is bending press with a finger from the top of a soft cloth 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:39.500
 Also put the cut in part of Makiko with scissors 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:39.500
 The standard for the cutting depth is 1 to 2 mm below the end of the sheet metal plate . 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:51.620
 Weave terminal in the back side using cloth while warming suite with dryer 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.620
 Crimp completely 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.580
 The corners of the corner can be woven in this way 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:11.220
 Paste in the order of the reinforcing tape number in the winding part 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.220
 Crimp with dry art squeegee 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.990
 Attach the garnish you removed first 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:33.349
 If the sheet remains blisters , warm the expression of the sheet with a dryer 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:37.970
 After inflating the water and inflating the water cheek 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:45.190
 Dress pin or a hole in the water bubbles in the design cutter 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:45.190
 Completely crimp using a finger press to remove water 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:56.190
 Peel and remove what was attached once 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:07:02.420
 Please do not remove the adhesive force after crimp in the drops 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.420
 Please do not wash within 24 hours after installation yet 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.169
 Further for gloss and prevent deterioration of the sheet 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:19.810
 I recommend the magical protection 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:19.810
 As protection and water repellency are very strong, please cure well
