00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
a mess because when I put in this I had

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.330 
a mess because when I put in this I had
to<00:01:07.440> force<00:01:08.160> it<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.360> meet<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.960> bathtub<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to force it out to meet the bathtub the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.740 
to force it out to meet the bathtub the
bathtub<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:11.970> too<00:01:12.240> big<00:01:13.460> or<00:01:14.460> too<00:01:14.490> small<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.360> an

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
bathtub was too big or too small just an

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.330 
bathtub was too big or too small just an
inch<00:01:15.960> too<00:01:16.229> small<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:17.760> boards

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
inch too small so if I use these boards

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.530 
inch too small so if I use these boards
one<00:01:20.340> by<00:01:20.550> twos<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.690> one<00:01:22.530> inch<00:01:22.740> boards<00:01:23.540> then

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
one by twos one by one inch boards then

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
one by twos one by one inch boards then
it<00:01:24.750> worked<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.680> um<00:01:27.229> but<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.550> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it worked so um but this is not this is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.760 
it worked so um but this is not this is
not<00:01:29.790> where<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> needs<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.660> so<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.530> should

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
not where it needs to be so this should

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.240 
not where it needs to be so this should
actually<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.369> much<00:01:32.550> wider<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.950> could<00:01:34.950> cut

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
actually be much wider or I could cut

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.870 
actually be much wider or I could cut
these<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:35.970> angle<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.340> could<00:01:38.550> put

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
these on an angle so that i could put

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
these on an angle so that i could put
drywall<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.930> meet<00:01:40.140> there<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.740> meet

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
drywall on it would meet there and meet

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.030 
drywall on it would meet there and meet
there<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> straight<00:01:42.920> used<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there right now this is straight used to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.540 
there right now this is straight used to
use<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> sawzall<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.150> do<00:01:45.300> that<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.370> I<00:01:47.430> need

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
use a sawzall to do that and then I need

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.310
