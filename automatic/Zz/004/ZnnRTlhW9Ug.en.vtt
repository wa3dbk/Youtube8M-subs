 Miss for you 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.630
 in the debate 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.470
 untill there 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.160
 how easy are you 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.490
 humanity always up to the df but 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.890
 let's say that about three years to here 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.000
 he started doing it as much more 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.430
 followed more frequently 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.790
 if you need this city six months ago 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.320
 this appears 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.270
 I understand who is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 of the department that coincidentally 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.909
 belongs to the publisher and supposedly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.420
 hired as your personal assistant 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.420
 yes yes that's the way it is and the one that comes all this 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.110
 exactly with my husband 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.509
 in the office of the primary office 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.399
 Well, in coordination with your secretary 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.799
 I take care of all relationships 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.259
 public of Don Gregorio's quality 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.490
 your public relations or that you do not 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.490
 make your relationships public 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.830
 it's not about saying I want to talk 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.020
 with you then I imagine that he wants 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.500
 talking about business matters can be 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.500
 Imagine 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 is sleeping with my husband 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:02.700
 who can if you are sleeping with my 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.560
 husband but who is saying that you are 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.770
 eating breakfast eating tempting puddle 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.300
 opining that they are dispatching you with my 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.819
 husband 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.680
 I do not understand what is meant by Spanish 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.680
 to my dad and mom 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.100
 since you arrived 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.220
 so I know all about you beautiful and 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.530
 in none of his reports speaks of 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.750
 married jokes that's the only thing that says 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.390
 is that the person who comes to visit from 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.770
 two to three times a week is my husband 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.230
 you have something that yes that all that 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.740
 you are saying 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.110
 and 7 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.890
 and whether or not the man now comes 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.340
 two or three times a week to pick up 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.340
 the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.830
 to review the manuscripts that my husband 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.210
 send you so tell your detective 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.210
 Private to detail 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.959
 and I'm going to take it because I feel like a 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.569
 cargo 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.989
 that is in the liquor store that I gave him 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.989
 to my husband
