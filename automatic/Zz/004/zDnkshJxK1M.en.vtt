00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
know and whatever when you you know

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.009 
know and whatever when you you know
people<00:04:02.549> make<00:04:02.729> dumb<00:04:03.120> decisions<00:04:03.150> when<00:04:03.900> they

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
people make dumb decisions when they

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.479 
people make dumb decisions when they
fall<00:04:04.260> for<00:04:04.470> somebody<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.919> you<00:04:05.040> look<00:04:05.280> past

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
fall for somebody and you look past

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.119 
fall for somebody and you look past
their<00:04:05.819> faults<00:04:06.180> these<00:04:06.389> were<00:04:06.540> faults<00:04:06.900> that

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
their faults these were faults that

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.170 
their faults these were faults that
obviously<00:04:08.129> you<00:04:08.280> shouldn't<00:04:08.579> look<00:04:08.639> past<00:04:08.909> but

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
obviously you shouldn't look past but

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.430 
obviously you shouldn't look past but
let's<00:04:09.329> not<00:04:09.449> lose<00:04:09.629> sight<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.900> who<00:04:10.079> committed

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
let's not lose sight of who committed

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.520 
let's not lose sight of who committed
the<00:04:10.530> crime<00:04:10.699> apparently<00:04:11.699> yeah<00:04:12.030> yeah<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:13.079> if

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
the crime apparently yeah yeah and if

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.729 
the crime apparently yeah yeah and if
he's<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.889> course<00:04:13.919> guilty<00:04:14.549> then<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:15.620> think<00:04:16.620> I

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
he's of course guilty then I think I

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.550 
he's of course guilty then I think I
mean<00:04:17.180> look<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.269> thing<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:18.810> its<00:04:19.139> life

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
mean look the thing is I think its life

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.870 
mean look the thing is I think its life
sentence<00:04:20.070> right<00:04:20.279> but<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.459> don't<00:04:20.639> think<00:04:20.729> you'll

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
sentence right but I don't think you'll

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.000 
sentence right but I don't think you'll
get<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.120> life<00:04:21.329> sentence

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
get a life sentence

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.040 
get a life sentence
I<00:04:22.250> think<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.000> they'll<00:04:23.210> say<00:04:23.510> well<00:04:23.720> he<00:04:23.840> didn't

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
I think that they'll say well he didn't

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.620 
I think that they'll say well he didn't
intend<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.470> kill<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.740> kid<00:04:25.040> I<00:04:25.820> mean<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.540> were

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
intend to kill the kid I mean you were

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.120 
intend to kill the kid I mean you were
former<00:04:26.930> prosecutor<00:04:27.530> Avenue<00:04:27.860> what<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.040> you

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
former prosecutor Avenue what do you

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.190 
former prosecutor Avenue what do you
think<00:04:28.280> he<00:04:28.340> gets<00:04:28.660> um<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:31.090> intended<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.210> kill

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
think he gets um I just intended to kill

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.110 
think he gets um I just intended to kill
the<00:04:33.320> kid<00:04:33.470> doll<00:04:33.650> large<00:04:33.950> egg<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.640> intended<00:04:35.030> the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
the kid doll large egg you intended the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.000 
the kid doll large egg you intended the
action<00:04:35.480> that's<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.170> like<00:04:36.350> it's<00:04:36.620> it's<00:04:36.800> um

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
action that's kind of like it's it's um

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.650 
action that's kind of like it's it's um
you<00:04:37.640> know<00:04:37.760> that's<00:04:37.940> not<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.180> way<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.420> theory

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
you know that's not the way the theory

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.240 
you know that's not the way the theory
of<00:04:38.690> intent<00:04:39.050> goes<00:04:39.170> if<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.470> intend<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.920> action

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
of intent goes if you intend the action

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.370 
of intent goes if you intend the action
so<00:04:40.340> if<00:04:40.430> he<00:04:40.550> intended<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.060> physically<00:04:41.900> hurt

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
so if he intended to physically hurt

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.900 
so if he intended to physically hurt
this<00:04:42.590> kid<00:04:42.830> in<00:04:42.950> any<00:04:43.070> way<00:04:43.250> doesn't<00:04:43.670> have<00:04:43.790> to

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
this kid in any way doesn't have to

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.400 
this kid in any way doesn't have to
intend<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.330> murder<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.750> doesn't<00:04:45.140> have<00:04:45.260> to

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
intend to murder it doesn't have to

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.590 
intend to murder it doesn't have to
intend<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.130> consequence<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:47.330> basically

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
intend the consequence so basically

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.270 
intend the consequence so basically
you're<00:04:47.810> caught<00:04:48.020> whatever<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.770> consequences

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
you're caught whatever the consequences

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.330 
you're caught whatever the consequences
are<00:04:49.430> they<00:04:49.550> follow<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:50.000> action<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:51.340> don't

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
are they follow the action so I don't

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.410 
are they follow the action so I don't
know<00:04:52.400> about<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.640> life<00:04:52.790> sentence<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.150> think<00:04:53.330> you

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
know about a life sentence I think you

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.520 
know about a life sentence I think you
might<00:04:53.540> be<00:04:53.660> right<00:04:53.840> but<00:04:53.870> but<00:04:54.230> certainly

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
might be right but but certainly

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.490 
might be right but but certainly
