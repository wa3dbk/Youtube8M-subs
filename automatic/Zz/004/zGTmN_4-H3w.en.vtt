that's<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> top<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> after<00:01:40.470> everything<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that's the top and after everything is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.109 
that's the top and after everything is
back<00:01:41.070> together<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.430> gonna<00:01:41.549> give<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> nice

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
back together I'm gonna give it a nice

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
back together I'm gonna give it a nice
fresh<00:01:42.329> coat<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.829> high<00:01:43.829> high<00:01:44.280> temp<00:01:44.579> blue<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.470> my

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
fresh coat of high high temp blue and my

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.840 
fresh coat of high high temp blue and my
transmission<00:01:47.040> goes<00:01:47.220> through<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.460> our<00:01:47.490> gears

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
transmission goes through all our gears

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.510 
transmission goes through all our gears
with<00:01:48.090> no<00:01:48.240> noise<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.780> very<00:01:48.990> happy<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
with no noise I'm very happy about that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.649 
with no noise I'm very happy about that
this<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> might<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> come<00:01:51.149> back<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
this I might have to come back off I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.109 
this I might have to come back off I
just<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> power<00:01:52.290> valve<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
just put the power valve back in and it

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
just put the power valve back in and it
works<00:01:54.360> fine<00:01:54.689> when<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
works fine when I put it in with the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
works fine when I put it in with the
gear<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.729> finally<00:01:57.119> figured<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:57.509> way<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
gear I finally figured out which way to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
gear I finally figured out which way to
gear<00:01:57.960> once<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> rollers<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> outside

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
gear once the rollers go on the outside

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
gear once the rollers go on the outside
when<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.909> put<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.270> spins<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> crank

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
when I put it in spins with the crank

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.740 
when I put it in spins with the crank
good<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.700> lubed<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> bearing<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
good and I lubed up the bearing in the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.270 
good and I lubed up the bearing in the
back<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> could<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:05.009> spring

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
back there so as you could see my spring

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.940 
back there so as you could see my spring
the<00:02:05.369> crank<00:02:05.610> idea<00:02:06.000> turns<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.619> only<00:02:07.799> thing

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the crank idea turns the only thing

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.260 
the crank idea turns the only thing
that's<00:02:08.099> stopping<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.700> putting<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.060> clutch

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that's stopping me from putting a clutch

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.729 
that's stopping me from putting a clutch
basket<00:02:09.450> back<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.050> because<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> cannot<00:02:10.560> put

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
basket back on is because I cannot put

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.140 
basket back on is because I cannot put
the<00:02:10.830> counterbalance<00:02:11.220> hair<00:02:11.520> back<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.790> yet<00:02:12.000> cuz

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the counterbalance hair back in yet cuz

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
the counterbalance hair back in yet cuz
that's<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> put<00:02:12.629> those<00:02:12.720> two<00:02:12.930> bolts

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that's it put those two bolts

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
that's it put those two bolts
but<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.459> other<00:02:15.000> thing<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.390> stopped<00:02:15.600> me

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
but you know other thing that stopped me

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.070 
but you know other thing that stopped me
from<00:02:15.810> putting<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> top<00:02:16.319> end<00:02:16.530> back<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.100> that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
from putting the top end back on is that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.050 
from putting the top end back on is that
there's<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.200> spacer<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.800> goes<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.819> power

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
there's a spacer that goes on the power

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.330 
there's a spacer that goes on the power
valve<00:02:21.330> over<00:02:21.600> here<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.560> spacer<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.040> lost

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
valve over here and that spacer I lost

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.730 
valve over here and that spacer I lost
it<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> won't<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.660> able<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.050> put<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.590> back

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
it so I won't be able to put that back

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.220 
it so I won't be able to put that back
on<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:27.270> I'm<00:02:27.480> probably<00:02:27.569> gonna<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.930> taking<00:02:28.140> apart

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
on so I'm probably gonna be taking apart

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.390 
on so I'm probably gonna be taking apart
my<00:02:28.410> power<00:02:28.620> valve<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:28.980> cleaning<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.310> out

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
my power valve and cleaning it out

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.010 
my power valve and cleaning it out
tonight<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.600> yeah

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
tonight but yeah

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.650 
tonight but yeah
right<00:02:31.319> now<00:02:31.470> I'm<00:02:31.530> gonna<00:02:31.680> heat<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:31.950> my<00:02:32.660> soldering

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
right now I'm gonna heat up my soldering

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.460 
right now I'm gonna heat up my soldering
gun<00:02:33.989> because<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.920> wires<00:02:35.100> came<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.819> my<00:02:36.030> um

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
gun because the wires came out on my um

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.979 
gun because the wires came out on my um
on<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.980> plugin<00:02:38.910> for<00:02:39.300> my<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.870> call

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
on this plugin for my what do you call

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.040 
on this plugin for my what do you call
it<00:02:40.140> stator<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.850> like<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.270> spliced<00:02:42.720> them<00:02:42.930> in

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it stator and I like I spliced them in

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.660 
it stator and I like I spliced them in
pretty<00:02:43.230> good<00:02:43.470> right<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.520> know<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
pretty good right here but you know I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.040 
pretty good right here but you know I
don't<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.060> want<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.330> take<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.510> chance<00:02:45.570> so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
don't really want to take a chance so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.090 
don't really want to take a chance so
I'm<00:02:46.200> probably<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.680> starve<00:02:46.920> them

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
I'm probably going to starve them

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.729 
I'm probably going to starve them
together<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:48.050> there<00:02:49.050> was<00:02:49.140> another<00:02:49.380> break

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
together and there was another break

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.290 
together and there was another break
around<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.250> somewhere<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> think<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:51.090> under

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
around here somewhere I think it's under

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.390 
around here somewhere I think it's under
this<00:02:51.390> tape<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:52.530> I'm<00:02:52.590> gonna<00:02:52.709> fix<00:02:52.890> all<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.100> now

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
this tape but I'm gonna fix all that now

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.979 
this tape but I'm gonna fix all that now
and<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.970> could<00:02:54.120> put<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> stator<00:02:54.570> back<00:02:54.810> on

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
and I could put the stator back on

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.020 
and I could put the stator back on
because<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:55.650> see<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.640> does<00:02:56.850> not

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
because as you can see it does not

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.430 
because as you can see it does not
interfere<00:02:57.360> with<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> counterbalance<00:02:58.170> here

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
interfere with the counterbalance here

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.020 
interfere with the counterbalance here
me<00:02:58.590> putting<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.920> back<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.640> could<00:02:59.910> put

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
me putting that back on so I could put

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.120 
me putting that back on so I could put
the<00:03:00.120> Savior<00:03:00.420> back<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.959> flywheel<00:03:01.170> I'm

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
the Savior back on at the flywheel I'm

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.050 
the Savior back on at the flywheel I'm
probably<00:03:02.370> acting<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.850> flywheel

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
probably acting up at the flywheel

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.110 
probably acting up at the flywheel
though<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.900> I'd<00:03:04.140> probably<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.530> um<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:05.120> broke

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
though and I'd probably be um I broke

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.750
