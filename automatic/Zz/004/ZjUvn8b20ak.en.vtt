00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:12.530
 and when I was a kid I liked the 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.079
 bike the ball but when I heard a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.440
 guitar automatically leaves the ball and 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.440
 the bike 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.960
 an authentic music that comes from the 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.070
 root of the village a marginalized people but 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.070
 thanks to 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.360
 to authenticity and how beautiful it is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 the music can 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.020
 it came out to floyd and it's booming has always 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.880
 been but now more I grew up 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.090
 getting up and watching shrimp paco 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.070
 lucia fernanda bernardas chocolate yo 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.420
 I am for example as a small child and 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.080
 half my father a guitar for the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.520
 played school and the guitar I do it 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.400
 go up that the guitar was going 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 stumbling over steps I see the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.600
 kids dance or sing or play the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.979
 guitar and flamenco is very demanding and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.240
 very jealous 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.620
 I think the closer you have it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.620
 of children better 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.340
 d 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.340
 where 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.250
 your house 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.250
 in my life 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.159
 a castle and a half 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.219
 and that's when another site 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.610
 with the greens 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.710
 d 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.700
 because there are people who do not like it 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.010
 feel attached to them but it's as if 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.320
 have the Prado Museum if you do not want 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.730
 go you do not go is first that someone 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.750
 flamenco take somebody puts 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.570
 a friend that someone talks to them about 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.040
 flamenco to put music to them and then what 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.630
 he just got it with his little 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.330
 my grandson of re small is listening 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.280
 flamenco and there you have it with the mouse and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.620
 a soleÃ¡ and the one you run 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.770
 you kill him but you can tell him 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.770
 misses
