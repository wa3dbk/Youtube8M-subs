00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.230
 yes, finally, the first 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:15.120
 transfer rumors felipe santana should 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 allegedly to schalke 04 changes from 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 borussia dortmund who does what 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 that is actually suicide for 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 ore shelves and then only 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 supposedly for a million because he 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.369
 has an exit clause in the contract 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.050
 I would really care what 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 This exit clause applies 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.850
 I hope not that he just for this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.360
 committed 1 million to schalke 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.129
 can go 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
 that would be fatal but I believe that if 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.309
 the Dortmunder at contract conclusion 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 was already not done 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.420
 mario götze is also going bavaria now 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.680
 it officially would also have the chance 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 but I said then I nee 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.980
 do not do that I'm going to be shy 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.079
 08 Kreis-Oberliga Wiesbaden 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 Of course, pep guardiola needs to be 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 play as a little flitzer flow 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.280
 as messi is also clear question is only 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 if then on the route remains 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.369
 Maybe Robert Miller recognizes her 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.780
 nevertheless , play Gomez out again 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.600
 wants to play maybe the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.590
 bavaria then yes with a like says 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.790
 one masked new or something 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.549
 I hope not, I do not think so 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 that it becomes so essential because the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.259
 bavaria will have 70 players in the year 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.700
 dfb cup bundesliga champions league 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.360
 also a whole will be on the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.030
 Bank sit 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 maybe in exchange of crawls 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.490
 you may not even crawl before 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 already sold 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.040
 who knows who knows 37 million have it 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 in any case paid in total 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 a contractual term of four years 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.149
 I think we came to one 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.310
 sum of 90 million euros this 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.970
 transfer effects include salary 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.070
 Of course, from idiots gross sum 37 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.070
 million is goddess the second most expensive 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.590
 Transfer of the history of the Bundesliga 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.210
 behind martins also to the bavaria 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.009
 So, you can see it already 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 bavaria has bags full of coal 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.220
 and you can throw it around too 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.410
 as they want 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 bavaria stop then there was the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.670
 shit then there was still the comment 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 from matthias sammer that time 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.280
 not so happy has been 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.350
 but it is clear that it is such a megadeal 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 comes out something backfotzig I have to 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.110
 say of the bavarian but this shopping 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.970
 at the competitor strange that one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.650
 a few days ago we said 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.480
 are afraid that the bundesliga to one 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.580
 two-class society becomes and 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 the bvb and swims made up 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 bavarian cities sorry and then to 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.250
 competitors go and the best 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.240
 player or the best player of the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.500
 windows ski is also a 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.920
 interesting candidate for bavaria 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.790
 Munich 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.170
 the two players then want to woo 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.210
 I have to say it again 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.370
 and I do not need me either 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.500
 complain about a two classes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.780
 society in the bundesliga or one 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.840
 wonder a wonder ibrahimovic stands 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.860
 allegedly before a new change 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.760
 namely to juventus turin 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.270
 and that's exactly where he played 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.250
 Now they have him one 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.140
 four-year contract offered but who 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.550
 who knows how much truth 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 that's it and if he really is 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.520
 after all, he is now changing 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.100
 only paris saint-germain changed and 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.940
 actually brings good performance 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.620
 Let's have a look 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.410
 Let's maybe increase the chance yes 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.780
 again his basic salary and what 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.740
 geißler still so in the gazettes josé 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.440
 mourinho 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.100
 José Mourinho is said to be a year old 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.970
 in addition 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.950
 Chelsea well, I'm not surprised 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.330
 actually 15 players in the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.150
 Cabin said we have none 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.680
 bock more to the trainer should I 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.920
 I also consider myself back for it 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.680
 cashiers so it is a country that holds 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.630
 to sit on the bench 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.340
 There must really be something in the bad 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.230
 especially Abramovich is a big fan of 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.670
 Mourinho I have to clear my mind 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.560
 Abramovich may be the club 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.720
 within three years, two titles 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.209
 won two championships in england 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.560
 because you're looking for such a trainer 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.260
 back that is probably true 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.330
 well, well, let's see what I have there 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.340
 yet this is what it was from ours 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.419
 transfer rumors we see we get 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.419
 a lightning message purely 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.160
 sensational 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.390
 uli Hoeneß changes for a transfer fee 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.500
 from 5 million to jva to munich 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.820
 and the whole without exit clause, well 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.230
 life came in we see this message 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.970
 stay with us again next time 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:45.570
 sporty and especially on the ball 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.430
 uli hoeneß is said to be in jail - the man 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.070
 who made the FC Bayern to what 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.070
 He is an honorable man
