00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and a light Brad the color I selected

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.460 
and a light Brad the color I selected
was<00:02:08.369> gray<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.360> color<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
was gray and this is the color is so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.320 
was gray and this is the color is so
it's<00:02:10.649> kind<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.190> light<00:02:11.610> brown<00:02:11.910> but

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it's kind of just like light brown but

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
it's kind of just like light brown but
when<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> open<00:02:12.810> my<00:02:12.900> package<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.530> thought<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.860> was

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
when I open my package I thought it was

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.950 
when I open my package I thought it was
like<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> dead<00:02:14.460> Fox<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.240> bag<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.660> something

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
like a dead Fox in my bag or something

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.290 
like a dead Fox in my bag or something
so<00:02:16.320> it's<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.560> creepy<00:02:16.980> at<00:02:17.040> first<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.790> got

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
so it's really creepy at first but I got

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.910 
so it's really creepy at first but I got
over<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.050> liked<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.200> because

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
over it and I really liked it because

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.500 
over it and I really liked it because
like<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.340> kind<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.610> college<00:02:21.000> today

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
like it's kind of college today

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.910 
like it's kind of college today
so<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> thought<00:02:22.080> I'd<00:02:22.170> pop<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.860> do

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so I thought I'd pop it on but I do

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220 
so I thought I'd pop it on but I do
really<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.330> sure<00:02:24.510> some<00:02:24.960> people

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
really like it I'm not sure some people

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.610 
really like it I'm not sure some people
my<00:02:25.350> dad<00:02:25.530> was<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.510> every<00:02:27.930> night<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.320> really

like<00:02:28.710> at<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> bottom<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.790> has<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
like at the bottom because it has like a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.620 
like at the bottom because it has like a
class-b<00:02:30.720> clip<00:02:31.580> but<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.670> can<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:33.000> clasp<00:02:33.300> onto

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
class-b clip but you can like clasp onto

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.620 
class-b clip but you can like clasp onto
the<00:02:33.900> other<00:02:34.650> edge<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.910> doesn't<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.240> forth

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the other edge so it doesn't like forth

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.160 
the other edge so it doesn't like forth
about<00:02:36.990> everywhere<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.580> 12

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
about everywhere and but that was 12

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.400 
about everywhere and but that was 12
$12.99

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410
