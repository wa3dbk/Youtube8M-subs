it's got quite a bit rougher but I don't
know<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.810> big<00:06:25.110> thing<00:06:25.139> to<00:06:25.349> is<00:06:25.590> now<00:06:25.740> they're<00:06:25.919> not

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
know the big thing to is now they're not

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.250 
know the big thing to is now they're not
watering<00:06:26.580> so<00:06:27.450> it's<00:06:27.570> been<00:06:27.720> pretty<00:06:27.930> dry<00:06:28.200> the

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
watering so it's been pretty dry the

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.860 
watering so it's been pretty dry the
glass<00:06:28.710> two<00:06:29.280> rounds<00:06:29.760> so<00:06:30.300> that<00:06:30.389> makes<00:06:30.599> a<00:06:30.750> big

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
glass two rounds so that makes a big

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.170 
glass two rounds so that makes a big
difference<00:06:30.930> too

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
difference too

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.719 
difference too
