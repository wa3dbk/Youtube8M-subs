00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
don't know there's something a bit well

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.250 
don't know there's something a bit well
there's<00:00:08.970> something<00:00:09.120> very<00:00:09.330> old-school<00:00:09.870> about

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
there's something very old-school about

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
there's something very old-school about
them<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> bit<00:00:10.889> sort<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.370> firm<00:00:11.700> twee<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
them and a bit sort of firm twee and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.870 
them and a bit sort of firm twee and
decadent<00:00:12.929> about<00:00:13.200> them<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.559> seems<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.790> have

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
decadent about them that seems to have

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.980 
decadent about them that seems to have
firm<00:00:15.150> hit<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> nerve<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:15.870> me<00:00:15.900> recently<00:00:16.820> um<00:00:17.990> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
firm hit a nerve with me recently um the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.050 
firm hit a nerve with me recently um the
reason<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.380> didn't<00:00:19.770> use<00:00:19.949> soaps<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.580> long<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
reason I didn't use soaps of so long is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.660 
reason I didn't use soaps of so long is
that<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.480> used<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.289> drying<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.490> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that they used to be so drying and just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.220 
that they used to be so drying and just
strip<00:00:24.060> everything<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.869> skin<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
strip everything out of your skin and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.019 
strip everything out of your skin and
they<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.470> felt<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.189> horrible<00:00:26.400> after<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
they just felt really horrible after you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
they just felt really horrible after you
use<00:00:27.300> them<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> reason

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
use them and I think that's the reason

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.429 
use them and I think that's the reason
why<00:00:29.220> lots<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> younger<00:00:30.660> generation<00:00:31.170> people

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
why lots of younger generation people

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.690 
why lots of younger generation people
don't<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.859> them<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.520> those

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
don't use them because they have those

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.220 
don't use them because they have those
horrible<00:00:33.000> memories<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.570> using<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.110> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
horrible memories of using the one in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.930 
horrible memories of using the one in
their<00:00:34.380> Nan's<00:00:34.620> loo<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.399> sort<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> like

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
their Nan's loo and just sort of like

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.880 
their Nan's loo and just sort of like
carbolic<00:00:36.540> horrible<00:00:36.989> stuff<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> swarthy

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
carbolic horrible stuff that swarthy

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
carbolic horrible stuff that swarthy
girl<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> went

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
girl or something and but then I went

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.900 
girl or something and but then I went
into<00:00:40.170> Porter<00:00:40.530> Mason's<00:00:41.040> recently<00:00:41.550> which<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
into Porter Mason's recently which is

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330 
into Porter Mason's recently which is
like<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> sort<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> Temple<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> shrine<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.100> soap

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
like a sort of Temple and shrine to soap

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340 
like a sort of Temple and shrine to soap
and<00:00:44.670> started<00:00:45.360> playing<00:00:45.539> around<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.110> all

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and started playing around with all

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
and started playing around with all
these<00:00:46.469> lovely<00:00:46.680> pretty<00:00:47.129> packages<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
these lovely pretty packages and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
these lovely pretty packages and
realised<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.350> things<00:00:49.800> have

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
realised that actually things have

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
realised that actually things have
really<00:00:50.129> moved<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> they're

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
really moved on a lot and they're

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
really moved on a lot and they're
nothing<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.739> bad<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> skin<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.730> of

nothing like as bad on the skin some of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.319 
nothing like as bad on the skin some of
them<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> real<00:00:54.239> treat<00:00:55.730> what<00:00:56.730> seems<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
them are a real treat what seems to have

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
them are a real treat what seems to have
happened<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.649> whereas<00:00:59.039> soap<00:00:59.489> impasse

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
happened is that whereas soap impasse

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
happened is that whereas soap impasse
has<00:01:00.149> always<00:01:00.300> been<00:01:00.570> made<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.079> animal<00:01:01.530> fats<00:01:01.770> or

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and then treated with alkaline to turn

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.010 
and then treated with alkaline to turn
into<00:01:06.570> soap<00:01:06.950> nowadays<00:01:08.630> those<00:01:09.630> ingredients
