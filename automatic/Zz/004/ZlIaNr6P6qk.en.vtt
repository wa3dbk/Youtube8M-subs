actually know so we're going to find out

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.270 
actually know so we're going to find out
I<00:00:09.780> don't<00:00:09.990> think<00:00:10.139> he's<00:00:10.230> meant<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:11.010> here

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
I don't think he's meant to be in here

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.549 
I don't think he's meant to be in here
but<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.120> never<00:00:12.269> know<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:12.990> figured<00:00:13.320> I'd<00:00:13.410> give

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
it a shot I think it's gonna be kind of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.810 
it a shot I think it's gonna be kind of
rough<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.770> don't<00:00:16.770> know<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.340> actually<00:00:17.490> able

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.190 

I'll<00:02:47.880> be<00:02:48.000> able<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.210> do<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.450> some<00:02:48.720> problem<00:02:54.200> we

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
I'll be able to do it some problem we

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.920 
I'll be able to do it some problem we
got<00:02:55.350> no<00:02:55.590> problem<00:02:56.100> but

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.190 

four<00:03:01.930> minutes<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.560> 4<00:03:03.099> seconds<00:03:03.870> cleared<00:03:04.870> every

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
four minutes and 4 seconds cleared every

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.309 
four minutes and 4 seconds cleared every
single<00:03:05.470> camp<00:03:05.709> once<00:03:05.950> really<00:03:06.640> slow<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.180> I'm<00:03:07.360> I'd

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
single camp once really slow but I'm I'd

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.020 
single camp once really slow but I'm I'd
be<00:03:08.470> level<00:03:08.709> four<00:03:08.950> after<00:03:09.160> one<00:03:09.310> more<00:03:09.459> clear<00:03:09.790> so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
be level four after one more clear so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.430 
be level four after one more clear so
I'd<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.239> with<00:03:10.360> care<00:03:10.569> rates<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.110> thought<00:03:11.319> that's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
I'd be with care rates I thought that's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.199 
I'd be with care rates I thought that's
not<00:03:11.680> too<00:03:11.950> hard<00:03:12.540> um<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:14.709> yeah<00:03:15.160> that's<00:03:15.459> really

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
not too hard um but yeah that's really

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.210 
not too hard um but yeah that's really
dangerous<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.780> used<00:03:16.930> every<00:03:17.230> single<00:03:17.560> pot<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.950> had

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
dangerous I used every single pot I had

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.070 
dangerous I used every single pot I had
a<00:03:18.580> decent<00:03:18.970> leash<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:19.780> only<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.050> one

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
a decent leash it's only from one

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.660 
a decent leash it's only from one
character<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.739> normally<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.130> know<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.310> have

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
character you normally you know you have

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.860 
character you normally you know you have
probably<00:03:21.880> have<00:03:22.060> two<00:03:22.180> people<00:03:22.360> helping<00:03:22.750> a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
probably have two people helping a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.350 
probably have two people helping a
little<00:03:23.050> bit<00:03:23.290> more<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:25.680> yeah<00:03:26.680> he's<00:03:26.920> slow<00:03:27.459> and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.940 

it<00:03:31.360> kind<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.720> seems<00:03:31.959> like<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.170> crappy<00:03:32.590> version

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
it kind of seems like a crappy version

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.559 
it kind of seems like a crappy version
