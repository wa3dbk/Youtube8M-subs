00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
there's dinosaurs under the ocean and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.560

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
they live in the valleys and the whale

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
they live in the valleys and the whale
is<00:00:51.750> their<00:00:51.870> natural<00:00:52.020> predator<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:53.100> isn't<00:00:53.520> what

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is their natural predator now isn't what

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.569 
is their natural predator now isn't what
he<00:00:53.789> doing<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.359> isn't<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.719> called<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> worm

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
he doing here isn't this called the worm

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
he doing here isn't this called the worm
why<00:00:56.579> isn't<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:56.969> called<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> whale<00:00:57.480> well<00:00:58.289> some

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
why isn't it called the whale well some

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
why isn't it called the whale well some
people<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.760> called<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> worm<00:01:00.329> but

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
people think that's called the worm but

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.569 
people think that's called the worm but
actually<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> called<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> well<00:01:02.160> that's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
actually it is called the well that's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.680 
actually it is called the well that's
what<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> whale<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.300> called

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
what the whale is called

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560 
what the whale is called
that's<00:01:04.320> correct<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.550> dance<00:01:05.910> move<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's correct it's a dance move it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.680 
that's correct it's a dance move it's
used<00:01:06.899> to<00:01:07.229> ward<00:01:07.920> off<00:01:08.100> predators<00:01:08.429> it's<00:01:09.390> also

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
used to ward off predators it's also

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.570 
used to ward off predators it's also
used<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.440> they're<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.340> bad

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
used when they're gonna have really bad

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.810 
used when they're gonna have really bad
diarrhea<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.450> people

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.720 

so<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.650> daughter<00:01:17.650> or<00:01:18.010> son<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.430> the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
so is that the daughter or son of the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.280 
so is that the daughter or son of the
wind<00:01:19.350> whales<00:01:20.350> don't<00:01:20.770> have<00:01:20.920> gender<00:01:21.430> that's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
wind whales don't have gender that's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.750 
wind whales don't have gender that's
that's<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.850> offspring<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:26.160> it<00:01:27.160> basically

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
that's the offspring and it basically

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.610 
that's the offspring and it basically
follows<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.510> well<00:01:28.660> around<00:01:28.900> for<00:01:29.320> its<00:01:29.410> early

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
follows the well around for its early

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.640 
follows the well around for its early
years<00:01:29.850> until<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:30.940> gets<00:01:31.120> bored<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.170> kills

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
years until it gets bored and it kills

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.410 
years until it gets bored and it kills
its<00:01:32.890> own

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
its own

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710 
its own
that's<00:01:34.420> why<00:01:34.600> whales<00:01:35.290> are<00:01:35.620> fairly<00:01:36.480> hard<00:01:37.480> to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
that's why whales are fairly hard to

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.520 
that's why whales are fairly hard to
find<00:01:37.960> because<00:01:38.260> they're<00:01:39.220> either<00:01:39.370> dead<00:01:40.530> that's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
find because they're either dead that's

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.960 
find because they're either dead that's
what's<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.950> happening<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:42.490> image<00:01:42.790> is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
what's it happening in this image is

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.040 
what's it happening in this image is
this<00:01:43.120> whale<00:01:43.390> dead

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
this whale dead

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.920 
this whale dead
well<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:44.770> was<00:01:45.190> contemplating<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.570> meaning

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
well this was contemplating the meaning

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.010 
well this was contemplating the meaning
of<00:01:47.290> life<00:01:47.500> right<00:01:47.800> now<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.600> whale's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
of life right now is this a whale's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.990 
of life right now is this a whale's

of the ocean well I think whales are
getting<00:02:24.040> pretty<00:02:24.220> boring<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:25.420> wonder<00:02:25.930> if

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
getting pretty boring I know I wonder if

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.449 
getting pretty boring I know I wonder if
we're<00:02:26.290> gonna<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.530> some<00:02:26.740> different<00:02:26.890> footage

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.590 
a Russian test pilot driven program so
it's<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.900> killer<00:02:41.260> type<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.420> animal
