00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.420
 Not Japco get me out automates the noisy city region for the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.299
 Ringtones that is 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.280

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.480
 Therefore, volume on the ringtones so call on all incomes 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 So it gets louder the ringtone 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.320
 So the Fed has thought so much of the blanket of antiquity 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.310
 if you put the iPhone in the top 70 grams you do not have the whole ringtone 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.040
 more so loud and that's why this bag has developed that you just all the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.949
 Whole calls abroad can be how the war works 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.269
 if you put it in your pocket the meteor would be if this one 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:45.639
 should this light sensor 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:47.380
 to be active so 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.460
 Mount Cook TUI Hellas is often dark so is on and when it's dark 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 then there it is in threesome trouser pockets because of that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 around Brigitte just the volume in the high ringtones 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.120
 the clique has a 49 insider 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 and here we are delighted a EUR 7 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 and here you have it all from the Big Boss sources 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 so we have more servings in the settings under Pocket Not 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.930
 Of course we can activate here in Melbourne 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.090
 and that's in the Light Sensor Sensitivity so the sensitivity of 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.930
 had explained a light sensor here around the Schalke 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.159
 and there are however various options with company headquarters in Suite G minor boys 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.999

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.440
 Kerner still gives her the option that she is best at texting too 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.179
 fit 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.050
 Sign can also make the runtime high 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.260
 if she is her bag at the corrugated partly but not imagine 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.020
 so they also have the old boat and many different options 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.370
 could appear and check out 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.860
 and yes that makes the trophy 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.630
 I should be able to show that we do not take that long 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.740
 until the whole thing has been tested 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.899
 and yes, in any case, that's how the whole country works that way 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.920
 single app Pocket Not looking 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.430
 Cascais install confirm and then the whole has the season winner 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.689
