00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.039
 good here tonight bringing another video 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.169
 tutorial for you and today's tutorial is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.509
 with reducing the ram's memory consumption 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.150
 your device may be a device 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.220
 most simple the most powerful 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 we will show that how to reduce the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.540
 consumption as if freeing space in the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.700
 device memory 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 First we'll need ruth 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 this application does not need guti 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.840
 need this device here even if the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.370
 green with whatever that is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.380
 I pronounce in English 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.620
 we are going to open the application will ask 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.200
 root access naturally after that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.660
 you will see that he has already opened a 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.870
 application list 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:14.189
 here in my case only the applications that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:15.689
 they hibernate and others that only and others 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.179
 that have not yet released 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.749
 so in case what this app does 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:25.259
 it for an application whether it leaves and 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:27.749
 Let's say so until you use it. 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 it again when you use it 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.340
 returns to normal operation when 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.539
 you open the application again he comes back 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 to operate normally without any 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.609
 problem 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.119
 how I'm going to put this app 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:42.149
 hibernation will come here on the go 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.030
 click here and move the apps 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.399
 you want is up to the application itself 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 recommends that you do not place any 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.319
 messaging or messaging application 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.520
 of instant stuff messages 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.009
 to have none 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.829
 problem or some applications that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.899
 need a good connection 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.600
 recommended that you do not put them in 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.490
 hibernation here are some 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.670
 apps that I do not use much place 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.330
 only protesting in the case of chat or 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.910
 select here and see your 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.450
 device may slow down 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.550
 When I lock, the lock is off. 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.470
 disabled for online 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.520
 so I 'm going to put these apps 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.700
 on here 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.220
 I selected him not only by clicking on him and I 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.730
 I'll be able to select everyone here. 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.230
 done that I just came over here ok 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.460
 he is already going to do the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.860
 hibernation 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.080
 what is the hibernation process in the case 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.390
 if you put the hibernate some 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.340
 message app you will not 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.580
 receive your messages 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.940
 When you open it, right. 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.280
 some that are outstanding when it is and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.330

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.160
 as they say 'I application will return to 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.010
 will function normally ie 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.860
 run when you want it it will not 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.220
 consume memory from your device 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.300
 during that during a process that 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.930
 you do not want 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.220
 so just add him and he will 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.910
 reduce the amount of RAM your 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.150
 appliance 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.300
 with this also reduce in percentage 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.300
 small but reduces battery consumption 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.340
 from your handset then beauty galley era
