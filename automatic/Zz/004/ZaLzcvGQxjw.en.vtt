00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
eye and for me I've noticed if I just

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.080 
eye and for me I've noticed if I just
follow<00:00:34.760> my<00:00:35.480> bottom<00:00:35.930> lid<00:00:36.170> in<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.670> direction

make<00:01:13.040> sure<00:01:13.850> they're<00:01:14.030> even<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.659> sometimes<00:01:15.200> you

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
make sure they're even and sometimes you

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.109 
make sure they're even and sometimes you
know<00:01:15.920> once<00:01:16.189> that'll<00:01:16.460> be<00:01:16.549> thicker<00:01:16.820> than<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
know once that'll be thicker than the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.749 
know once that'll be thicker than the
other<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.930> can<00:01:18.830> totally<00:01:19.009> layer<00:01:19.460> this

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759
