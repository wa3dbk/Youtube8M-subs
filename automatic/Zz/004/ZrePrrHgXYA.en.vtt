new<00:00:29.090> project<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:30.520> new<00:00:31.520> base<00:00:31.730> will<00:00:32.150> be<00:00:32.270> fine<00:00:32.980> we

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
new project and new base will be fine we

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.170 
new project and new base will be fine we
can<00:00:34.070> call<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:34.400> math<00:00:35.110> whatever<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:36.200> want<00:00:37.180> okay

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
can call it math whatever you want okay

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.740 
can call it math whatever you want okay
first<00:00:38.570> we<00:00:38.960> want<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.200> go<00:00:39.290> into<00:00:39.410> free<00:00:39.680> months<00:00:40.070> and

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
first we want to go into free months and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.600 
first we want to go into free months and
we<00:00:41.750> want<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.140> click<00:00:42.290> on<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.649> actually<00:00:43.340> right

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
we want to click on this actually right

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.870 
we want to click on this actually right
click<00:00:43.880> on<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.060> and<00:00:44.440> click<00:00:45.440> reveal<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.520> find

click on that and click reveal and find

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.380 
click on that and click reveal and find
her<00:00:47.290> so<00:00:48.290> we<00:00:48.649> want<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.040> go<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:49.579> find<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.120> map

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
her so we want to go and find the map

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.830 
her so we want to go and find the map
kit<00:00:50.690> framework<00:00:51.610> so<00:00:52.610> we<00:00:52.910> drag<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.329> map<00:00:53.510> kit

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
kit framework so we drag the map kit

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.410 
kit framework so we drag the map kit
framework<00:00:54.320> right<00:00:54.829> into<00:00:55.100> there<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.149> maps

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
framework right into there so that maps

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.220 
framework right into there so that maps
will<00:00:56.960> work<00:00:57.200> and<00:00:57.440> that's<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:58.460> need<00:00:58.730> right<00:00:58.969> there

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
will work and that's so need right there

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.130 
will work and that's so need right there
now<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.590> code<00:01:00.860> is<00:01:00.940> really<00:01:01.940> really<00:01:02.360> simple

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
now the code is really really simple

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.510 
now the code is really really simple
for<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.829> basic<00:01:04.189> just<00:01:05.350> choose<00:01:06.350> your<00:01:06.469> location<00:01:07.990> so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
for a basic just choose your location so

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.999 
for a basic just choose your location so
before<00:01:10.520> here<00:01:10.759> we're<00:01:11.299> going<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:12.819> import<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
before here we're going to import the

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:24.519 
before here we're going to import the

H<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.159> we'll<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.639> close<00:01:25.819> that<00:01:25.880> off<00:01:26.060> with<00:01:26.539> the

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:27.279 
H and we'll just close that off with the

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:32.410 
H and we'll just close that off with the
these<00:01:28.279> and<00:01:29.560> now<00:01:30.560> we're<00:01:30.770> gonna<00:01:30.859> do<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:32.240> between

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
these and now we're gonna do in between

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.999 
these and now we're gonna do in between
the<00:01:32.689> brackets<00:01:34.359> MK<00:01:35.359> map<00:01:36.909> view<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.829> we'll<00:01:39.829> call

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
the brackets MK map view and we'll call

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.109 
the brackets MK map view and we'll call
it<00:01:40.240> map<00:01:41.649> view

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
it map view

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.190 
it map view
yeah<00:01:44.509> I'm<00:01:44.599> not<00:01:44.719> views<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.289> easiest<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:47.079> so<00:01:48.079> we

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
yeah I'm not views the easiest and so we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.279 
yeah I'm not views the easiest and so we
just<00:01:48.439> made<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:49.759> map<00:01:50.090> view<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.599> now<00:01:50.779> we're<00:01:51.139> gonna

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
just made a map view and now we're gonna

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:59.099 
just made a map view and now we're gonna
do<00:01:51.560> an<00:01:52.340> app<00:01:52.700> property<00:01:55.689> non-atomic<00:01:56.689> retain

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
do an app property non-atomic retain

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:11.050 
do an app property non-atomic retain
iboutlet<00:02:01.060> MK<00:02:02.060> map<00:02:02.899> view<00:02:04.959> sorry<00:02:06.279> map<00:02:08.410> okay<00:02:10.060> so

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
iboutlet MK map view sorry map okay so

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.590 
iboutlet MK map view sorry map okay so
that's<00:02:11.210> all<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.480> need<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:11.780> here

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
that's all you need in here

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.600 
that's all you need in here
save<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.890> dot<00:02:15.040> em<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:17.610> now

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
save that going to the dot em and now

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.580 
save that going to the dot em and now
we're<00:02:18.760> gonna<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> sense<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
we're gonna have to sense the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.390 
we're gonna have to sense the
synthesized<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.830> under<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> at

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
synthesized it under the at

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.810 
synthesized it under the at
implementation<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.350> do<00:02:23.500> act

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
implementation so you can do act

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.780 
implementation so you can do act
synthesized<00:02:25.380> by<00:02:26.380> Matthew<00:02:27.100> or<00:02:27.400> whatever<00:02:27.670> you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
synthesized by Matthew or whatever you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.430 
synthesized by Matthew or whatever you
call<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:32.080> don't<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.320> to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
call it it so and now you don't have to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.050 
call it it so and now you don't have to
mess<00:02:32.590> around<00:02:32.740> with<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.370> one<00:02:33.760> simple

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
mess around with this it's one simple

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.870 
mess around with this it's one simple
very<00:02:34.450> simple<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:34.990> code<00:02:35.760> uncomment<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
very simple on a code uncomment this and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.980 
very simple on a code uncomment this and
remember<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.180> there<00:02:40.720> will

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
remember this is just there will

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.210 
remember this is just there will
definitely<00:02:41.710> be<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.310> part<00:02:42.610> two<00:02:42.880> with<00:02:43.180> like<00:02:44.220> more

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
definitely be a part two with like more

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.050 
definitely be a part two with like more
actions<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:47.220> stuff<00:02:48.300> like<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.820> out<00:02:51.820> of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
actions and stuff like that so out of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.480 
actions and stuff like that so out of
this<00:02:52.660> right<00:02:53.020> after<00:02:53.290> these<00:02:53.560> press<00:02:54.100> man<00:02:54.280> here

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
this right after these press man here

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.370 
this right after these press man here
and<00:02:54.670> we'll<00:02:55.600> do<00:02:55.780> Matt

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
and we'll do Matt

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.470 
and we'll do Matt
vo<00:02:56.740> dot<00:02:57.730> show<00:02:58.660> shows<00:02:59.590> user<00:03:00.040> location<00:03:00.480> pretty

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
vo dot show shows user location pretty

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.500 
vo dot show shows user location pretty
much<00:03:01.690> self-explanatory<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:03.490> means<00:03:03.730> it's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
much self-explanatory it means it's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.130 
much self-explanatory it means it's
going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.840> show<00:03:05.050> where<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.770> location<00:03:06.130> is<00:03:06.370> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
going to show where your location is and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:18.530 
going to show where your location is and
equals<00:03:08.140> yes<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:09.340> want<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.880> do<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:15.180> and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.300 

close<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.870> make<00:03:20.230> sure<00:03:20.380> it's<00:03:20.769> already<00:03:21.070> close

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
close that make sure it's already close

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.780 
close that make sure it's already close
and<00:03:21.730> now<00:03:22.690> I'll<00:03:22.870> go<00:03:23.050> down<00:03:23.230> here<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.769> we<00:03:24.760> can

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
and now I'll go down here and we can

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.290 
and now I'll go down here and we can
release<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.810> map<00:03:26.019> view<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.030> your<00:03:28.120> map

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
release the map view so you can your map

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.300 
release the map view so you can your map
you<00:03:28.870> release<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:35.650> all<00:03:36.010> we<00:03:36.130> need<00:03:36.280> for

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
you release and that's all we need for

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.360 
you release and that's all we need for
the<00:03:36.550> coding<00:03:36.910> production<00:03:37.360> pretty<00:03:37.870> simple<00:03:38.370> so

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the coding production pretty simple so

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.100 
the coding production pretty simple so
save<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.120> build<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.630> just<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.959> make<00:03:41.050> sure

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
save that and build it just to make sure

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.949 
save that and build it just to make sure
there's<00:03:41.440> no<00:03:41.590> errors<00:03:42.959> there<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.260> an<00:03:44.440> error<00:03:45.959> no

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
there's no errors there is an error no

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.590 
there's no errors there is an error no

declaration of Matt B oh oops got to

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.180 
declaration of Matt B oh oops got to
capitalize<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.500> be<00:03:53.709> careful<00:03:54.070> with

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
capitalize that and be careful with

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.290 
capitalize that and be careful with
those<00:03:54.510> say<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:56.100> succeeded<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:58.000> we'll<00:03:58.180> go

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
those say that and succeeded so we'll go

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.350 
those say that and succeeded so we'll go
into<00:03:58.800> resources<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.100> we'll<00:04:00.280> go<00:04:00.400> into<00:04:00.550> map<00:04:00.790> you

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
into resources and we'll go into map you

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.920 
into resources and we'll go into map you
controller<00:04:01.780> that<00:04:01.900> XIV<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:03.660> we're<00:04:04.660> just<00:04:04.810> gonna

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
controller that XIV and we're just gonna

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.310 
controller that XIV and we're just gonna
build<00:04:05.140> interface<00:04:06.130> um<00:04:06.580> really<00:04:07.300> easy<00:04:09.810> okay<00:04:10.810> now

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
build interface um really easy okay now

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.820 
build interface um really easy okay now
obviously<00:04:11.940> we're<00:04:12.940> gonna<00:04:13.030> pick<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:14.489> map<00:04:15.489> view<00:04:16.830> we

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
obviously we're gonna pick a map view we

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.390 
obviously we're gonna pick a map view we
can<00:04:18.160> drag<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:22.050> we<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.740> can<00:04:24.010> drag<00:04:24.220> that

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
can drag in and we can you can drag that

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.340 
can drag in and we can you can drag that
in<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:24.789> I'm<00:04:24.910> not<00:04:25.060> going<00:04:25.390> to

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
in but I'm not going to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.750 
in but I'm not going to
so<00:04:26.860> now<00:04:27.130> click<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:28.170> files<00:04:29.170> owner<00:04:29.530> go<00:04:30.430> into<00:04:30.670> the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
so now click on files owner go into the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.110 
so now click on files owner go into the
connections<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.630> drag<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.530> Matthew<00:04:33.120> its

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
connections and drag the Matthew its

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.070 
connections and drag the Matthew its
Matthew<00:04:34.980> save<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.940> quit<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.480> we're

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
Matthew save that and quit and we're

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.700 
Matthew save that and quit and we're
done<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.920> let's<00:04:39.160> build<00:04:39.400> an<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.700> test<00:04:40.030> this<00:04:40.210> app

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
done so let's build an on test this app

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.380 
done so let's build an on test this app
it<00:04:41.710> will<00:04:41.800> not<00:04:42.010> show<00:04:42.400> it'll<00:04:42.790> just<00:04:43.000> show<00:04:43.060> the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
it will not show it'll just show the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.470 
it will not show it'll just show the
default<00:04:43.780> location<00:04:43.900> on<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.310> simulator<00:04:45.730> but<00:04:45.970> I

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
default location on the simulator but I

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.310 
default location on the simulator but I
did<00:04:46.720> try<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.050> on<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.530> phone<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.220> works<00:04:49.320> so

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
did try it on the phone and it works so

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.510 
did try it on the phone and it works so
you<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.620> try<00:04:50.800> that<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:53.440> see<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:54.040> pops<00:04:54.340> up

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
you can try that so you see it pops up

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.770 
you can try that so you see it pops up
with<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:56.850> default<00:04:57.850> location<00:04:57.970> because<00:04:58.660> it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
with the default location because it

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.870 
with the default location because it
doesn't<00:04:59.050> work<00:04:59.170> on<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.470> simulator<00:04:59.920> and<00:05:00.130> you

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
doesn't work on the simulator and you

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.050 
doesn't work on the simulator and you
see<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.510> see<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.780> you<00:05:02.050> can<00:05:02.640> double<00:05:03.640> tap<00:05:03.820> to

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
see you see that you can double tap to

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:12.390 
see you see that you can double tap to
zoom<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:07.560> or<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:10.180> finger<00:05:10.540> pinch<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.170> it<00:05:12.010> shows

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
zoom in or to finger pinch and it shows

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.870 
zoom in or to finger pinch and it shows
like<00:05:13.440> somewhere<00:05:14.440> in<00:05:14.500> California<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.810> also<00:05:16.810> um

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
like somewhere in California I also um

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.580 
like somewhere in California I also um
you<00:05:18.880> can<00:05:19.000> go<00:05:19.120> back<00:05:19.300> into<00:05:19.510> go<00:05:20.050> into<00:05:20.500> the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
you can go back into go into the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.390 
you can go back into go into the
controller<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:24.750> you<00:05:25.750> can<00:05:25.870> click<00:05:26.050> on<00:05:26.170> that<00:05:26.400> you

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
controller and you can click on that you

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.500 
controller and you can click on that you
can<00:05:27.520> go<00:05:27.640> into<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.000> attributes<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:30.610> can

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
can go into the attributes and you can

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.860 
can go into the attributes and you can
do<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:31.810> satellite<00:05:32.410> or<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.650> hybrid<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:34.360> let's<00:05:34.570> do<00:05:34.840> a

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
do a satellite or a hybrid so let's do a

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.970 
do a satellite or a hybrid so let's do a
hybrid<00:05:35.410> and<00:05:36.690> it<00:05:37.690> shows<00:05:37.960> loose<00:05:38.200> location<00:05:38.800> just

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
hybrid and it shows loose location just

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.270 
hybrid and it shows loose location just
make<00:05:39.100> sure<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:40.060> yeah<00:05:40.810> multiple<00:05:41.800> touch<00:05:42.010> make

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
make sure you yeah multiple touch make

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.800 
make sure you yeah multiple touch make
sure<00:05:42.460> save<00:05:43.450> click<00:05:43.870> build<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:44.860> run<00:05:46.470> so<00:05:47.470> now

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
sure save click build and run so now

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.870 
sure save click build and run so now
when<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.900> loads<00:05:50.050> up<00:05:50.350> you'll<00:05:51.130> see<00:05:51.370> you<00:05:51.490> get<00:05:51.640> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
when it loads up you'll see you get the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.600 
when it loads up you'll see you get the
satellite<00:05:52.570> version<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.260> it<00:05:54.130> will<00:05:54.370> show

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
satellite version and it will show

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.860 
satellite version and it will show
wherever<00:05:55.480> you<00:05:55.780> are<00:05:55.840> I<00:05:55.990> am<00:05:56.320> NOT<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.800> California

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
wherever you are I am NOT in California

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.970 
wherever you are I am NOT in California
if<00:05:58.870> it<00:05:59.290> is<00:05:59.680> on<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.070> phone<00:06:01.680> so<00:06:02.680> that's

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
if it is on the phone so that's

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.110 
if it is on the phone so that's
basically<00:06:03.400> how<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.610> make<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:03.850> simple<00:06:05.070> map

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
basically how to make a simple map

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.490 
basically how to make a simple map
application<00:06:07.120> there<00:06:07.300> will<00:06:07.330> be<00:06:07.570> a<00:06:07.810> second<00:06:08.440> part

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
application there will be a second part

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.460 
application there will be a second part
or<00:06:08.890> another<00:06:09.460> video<00:06:09.760> and<00:06:10.450> a<00:06:10.540> more<00:06:10.750> detailed<00:06:11.260> one

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
or another video and a more detailed one

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.120 
or another video and a more detailed one
