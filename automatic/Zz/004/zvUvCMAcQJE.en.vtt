 hello I am maxence hairdresser at the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.639
 last of paris and I will realize 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.290
 in front of your cup of ian somerhalder 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.290
 on octavio 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.980
 for this cut I will first come 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.259
 to take care of the lightness and come 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.829
 remove from the mass in the set of 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.829
 ankle 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 he 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.210
 when it comes to bringing legion 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.160
 in section it is still essential to 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.610
 keep a nice harmony at the level of 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.200
 the head 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.780
 that's why we usually 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.580
 let's keep a little crazy here so 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.770
 to have a nice rounded I so 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.260
 now come and take care of the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.570
 picket cutting structure for 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.780
 to bring the lightness you need 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.700
 picketing consists of coming to cut 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.710
 vertically the wick so 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.110
 to bring all the lightness of which one has 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.890
 need and to avoid indeed in contact 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.320
 of the cup 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.729
 even for a messy hair effect he 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.350
 is important to have a good 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.180
 cutting structure so that the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.930
 aging of it can 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 to persist in time 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.310
 and now we will proceed to 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.860
 styling I had used a circus of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.600
 gum texture that will allow me to 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.600
 come to work the whole mass 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.930
 with this shot you can work in 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.660
 disheveled effect capped by pinching 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.930
 hair like that to ultimately bring 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.959
 volume and come down the points 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.959
 this in order to achieve the desired effect 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.640
 so we have just seen with octavio the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.620
