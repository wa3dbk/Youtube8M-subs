a<00:02:29.610> comment<00:02:30.329> down<00:02:30.540> below<00:02:30.810> um<00:02:32.629> but<00:02:34.099> honestly<00:02:35.099> I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
a comment down below um but honestly I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.030 
a comment down below um but honestly I
think<00:02:35.640> they<00:02:35.760> should<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.379> leave<00:02:37.379> it<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.620> 85

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
think they should just leave it at 85

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.220 
think they should just leave it at 85
and<00:02:38.489> if<00:02:38.640> they<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:38.849> go<00:02:39.360> anywhere<00:02:39.720> else<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.079> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and if they do go anywhere else with it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.740 
and if they do go anywhere else with it
90<00:02:41.159> because<00:02:41.519> 85<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.239> can<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.629> start

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
90 because 85 you can actually start

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.300 
90 because 85 you can actually start
getting<00:02:42.930> some<00:02:43.049> good<00:02:43.260> gear<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.739> some<00:02:43.920> dungeons

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
getting some good gear and some dungeons

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
getting some good gear and some dungeons
so<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.269> not<00:02:45.450> necessary<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.019> keep<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
so it's really not necessary to keep the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.530 
so it's really not necessary to keep the
boa<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.099> just<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.670> wanted<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.180> send<00:02:48.329> it<00:02:48.480> to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
boa and just if you wanted to send it to

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.140 
boa and just if you wanted to send it to
another<00:02:48.720> tune<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.170> might<00:02:49.349> need<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.549> 85

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
another tune that might need it so 85

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.229 
another tune that might need it so 85
seems<00:02:51.480> very<00:02:51.660> reasonable<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.319> otherwise<00:02:53.239> 90

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
seems very reasonable to me otherwise 90

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.690 
seems very reasonable to me otherwise 90

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
easy to come by all the time because you

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.290 
easy to come by all the time because you
know<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.520> one<00:04:23.820> piece<00:04:23.969> is<00:04:24.150> like<00:04:24.270> a

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
know it what is it one piece is like a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.750 
know it what is it one piece is like a
hundred<00:04:24.570> eighty<00:04:24.900> four<00:04:25.229> tickets<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.800> think

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
hundred eighty four tickets I think

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.180 
hundred eighty four tickets I think
ridiculous<00:04:27.540> like<00:04:27.990> no<00:04:28.320> one<00:04:28.530> wants<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.160> that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
ridiculous like no one wants to do that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.610 
ridiculous like no one wants to do that
and<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.850> would<00:04:29.940> take<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.300> lot<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:30.960> time<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.440> get

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
and it would take a lot of time to get

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.620 
and it would take a lot of time to get
heirlooms<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.250> at<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:32.940> point<00:04:33.180> no<00:04:33.450> one's

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
heirlooms and at that point no one's

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.720 
heirlooms and at that point no one's
gonna<00:04:33.750> want<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.020> do<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.260> no<00:04:35.250> one's<00:04:35.430> gonna<00:04:35.490> buy

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
gonna want to do it no one's gonna buy

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.250 
gonna want to do it no one's gonna buy
them<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.210> why<00:04:36.480> even<00:04:36.510> keep<00:04:36.930> them<00:04:37.080> in<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.230> game

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
them so why even keep them in the game

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.460 
them so why even keep them in the game
um<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.880> think<00:04:39.240> they<00:04:39.330> should<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.870> keep<00:04:40.230> them

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
um I think they should just keep them

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.740 
um I think they should just keep them
with<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.130> vendors<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.670> know<00:04:41.700> fine<00:04:42.390> take<00:04:42.600> them

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750

those costs like 1k 1.3 k gold each and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.280 
those costs like 1k 1.3 k gold each and
you<00:05:24.360> think<00:05:24.540> a<00:05:24.600> lower<00:05:24.750> level<00:05:24.930> player<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.230> gonna

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
you think a lower level player is gonna

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.670 
you think a lower level player is gonna
have<00:05:25.500> 1.3<00:05:26.010> k<00:05:26.400> gold<00:05:26.670> maybe<00:05:27.570> if<00:05:27.930> they<00:05:28.290> have<00:05:28.470> nice

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
have 1.3 k gold maybe if they have nice

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.590 
have 1.3 k gold maybe if they have nice
friends<00:05:28.920> or<00:05:29.280> maybe<00:05:29.580> if<00:05:29.850> they<00:05:30.000> just<00:05:30.150> farm<00:05:30.390> for

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
friends or maybe if they just farm for

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.110 
friends or maybe if they just farm for
gold<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:31.020> mean<00:05:31.200> it<00:05:31.830> really<00:05:32.040> all<00:05:32.280> depends<00:05:32.700> but

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
gold I mean it really all depends but

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.000 
gold I mean it really all depends but
for<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.600> lot<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.870> players<00:05:34.140> I'm<00:05:34.440> sure<00:05:34.710> they<00:05:34.830> don't

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
for a lot of players I'm sure they don't

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.540 
for a lot of players I'm sure they don't
have<00:05:35.190> 1.3<00:05:35.700> k<00:05:36.000> gold<00:05:36.210> at<00:05:36.360> level<00:05:36.570> 10<00:05:36.780> just

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
floating around on their pocket waiting

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.660 
floating around on their pocket waiting
to<00:05:39.690> be<00:05:39.780> spent<00:05:40.190> hopefully<00:05:41.190> they<00:05:41.340> will<00:05:41.490> keep

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
to be spent hopefully they will keep

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.280 
to be spent hopefully they will keep

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
heirlooms in the game but again that's

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.200
