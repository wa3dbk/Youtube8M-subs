00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.219
 Hello my name is Vlad 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.420
 new narrow our review today with us 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.510
 there will be not one gadget but two 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.099
 so here they look enough in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.390
 bulky gizmos and they are called 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.380
 perfeo 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 elegance and prisms here September 1st Speaker of the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 there are dancing musical fountains 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.020
 Well, I don't know if it's true or 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.469
 wrong but check 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.489
 especially here they say nothing but 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.059
 demonstrate how cool it is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.309
 looks like 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.309
 and tell you a little about the features and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 sounds that they make 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.940
 in general, then let's go 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.160
 consider these two columns in more detail 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.649
 does not fit just in the frame so 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.650
 We use as a background one but all 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.479
 Now considered in detail 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.630
 in general, quite interesting in principle 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.549
 the thing is column fountains i'm from to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.970
 I survey the first time use the first 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.220
 times so it is doubly interesting and good 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.159
 on this i finish let's go to 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.500
 review of the speakers themselves 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.430
 the device wanted to say the device is not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.880
 the most common gadget 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.410
 he carries on the business that before us is a model 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.280
 to the first she is called 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:39.670
 elegance and it has a number like this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.000
 has a number on pff double y d from 09 and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.369
 Well, also not the easiest name but 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.869
 here there is something like elegance 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:58.119
 here's a dancin 'speaker ie columns 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.649
 speakers with dancing water then by the way 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.840
 whether the second box for seedlings 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.170
 consider and proceed to the review 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.300
 singhari don't even know which side to 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.709
 get to this business but let's go over 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.690
 technical specifications they are in principle 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.080
 about the same differs only 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.470
 the look and feel of how is it 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.750
 everything 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.790
 is crushed and so this model is with us 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.239
 called prism 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.020
 and the number and and p. 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:31.660
 wds 10 peak but generally enough 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.000
 cool and so here 6 watts is enough 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.940
 all loud qualitatively in this can not 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.890
 doubt in principle how the speakers are very 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.970
 cool over not the most important thing not the most 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.640
 actual feature 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.440
 let's unpack and see what's in there 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 actually included in both 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.209
 speakers everything in the kit lies 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.910
 about the same speakers themselves 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.530
 usb cable to connect and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.720
 power from your computer yes yes 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.970
 friends are more nutritious from the usb outlet 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.560
 your computer so he is sure to 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 should be free and of course all 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.820
 all necessary cables 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.709
 connect to your mobile 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.470
 device computer and so on 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.480
 there is a text meter meter 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.810
 and so here are two things 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.099
 he is not visible yet 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.069
 it is worth and dignity all the cables 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.470
 Now this is the cabin I will lower down and we 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.040
 visually compare them together I will not 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.760
 connect while I'll put them like this 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.830
 They look 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.650
 this is our model for prism here is not something 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.940
 like a prism then that plastic or 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.420
 the glass that is used here 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.680
 garlic does not want to lie so with its all 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.230
 Equally made here and now 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.959
 compare what the other two look like 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.840
 speakers though well amd ati we now i 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.310
 I will install and translate the frame so that you 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.349
 really was interesting 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.970
 look because here's the top here 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.569
 probably not prokanaet 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.370
 well 5 so shoulder and be back and dear 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.290
 friends let's see everything clearly 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.720
 how will it work now i will 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.579
 got these connect them you look 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.489
 how does it all play like this dick 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.100
 jerking but also appreciate for 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.990
 so that everything looks more honest I will not 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.330
 do a test 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.700
 the evening before when it gets dark to make 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.529
 happy afternoon but it's clear that in the evening from all 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.139
 will look prettier however 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:35.219
 in if it is testing and testing the most 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.329
 harsh conditions 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:42.029
 ok start some sort of reminder that we have left 

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:44.939
 standing on a model called prism of 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:47.429
 on the right model called elegance 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:50.809
 well let's see what of yourself 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:50.809
 represents a prism 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.360
 and the second part of the composition let's 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:57.510
 give up a model called elegance 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.510
 bacon 2 what we start 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.380
 and that's all I want to bring small 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.960
 the result of course is to call it full 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.780
 review difficult after all rather 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.360
 a demonstration of some possibility though 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.970
 it looks like you confess all the same and not bad 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.160
 interestingly enough especially if you 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.229
 regard as a gift for example 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.419
 for the new year will be very soon well 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.479
 or at least for the Christmas holidays 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:26.229
 Well, and in general, you probably 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:28.510
 you can surprise your friends and not only 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:31.870
 friends of relatives and caught up to overcome 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.389
 unusual to the boat and in general is quite 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.220
 for reasonable money in general if you 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.479
 liked put likes write to 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.660
 comments on how much you are from 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:45.000
 I liked it, but I probably finish it before 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.000
 next release bye bye
