 we will play the deadly kombat disappointment 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.340
 would show a little the interface that has 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.100
 good the menus and as always 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.220
 I teach has chess puzzle conquest 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.340

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.030
 same crypt router to see good for 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.190
 unlocking objects and such good is like 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.620
 a kind of tricks to put 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.080
 content to the movies good and I left the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.660
 trailer so you can see the ones since 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.479
 I have not seen the trailer and the people who 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.510
 would like to watch trailer on youtube 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.400
 I have left it there the profile since 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.729
 It also weighs a lot because I've uploaded it 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.050
 separately we will start playing mode 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.960
 combat let's go in arcade to see good I 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.420
 I lingua finish it you will not go down 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 to this that sounds a bit loud 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.170
 it ends well there are many people like 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.790
 you can see is one of the best games 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.950
 of fight for the skin and for me too 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.210
 is very well is very good or is there 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.210
 than having it on the pc 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.620
 the truth that a good game 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:12.030
 but then the characters too see 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.490
 let's choose to barack one I do not know 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 use a lot but well let's see how 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.730
 I develop with the character as 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.019
 this the final boss 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.629
 let's start good I'll go cutting 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.540
 since the beginning is easy 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.810
 characters of the beginning has a 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.810
 difficulty 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.880
 good 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.010
 have each person and have as their 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.010
 weapons too 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.620
 if I'm recording myself 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.620
 it's a bit slow I think 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.640
 it seems that no 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.640
 not a little slow 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.590
 although not frames or anything but 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.660
 as halo 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.660
 in slow motion but think 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:35.120
 the witch 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.120
 do not make us 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.490
 Y 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.220
 about what he has done 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.240
 now pim 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.200
 with jacques 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.200
 it does not take place 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:12.620
 the game is called one is called game of 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:16.870
 exception as it is not called of sergio 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.870
 as I said earlier it's called 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.950
 And they are like good themselves 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.470
 but with different name the truth 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.020
 it's the same game 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.789
 it was that it came out for the boring plicas 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.440
 but when different was a proportion 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.440
 I did not know much good 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.270
 poor 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.650
 good guys we are with the exercise 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.229
 end to see if I can not load 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.340
 to see the program that he uses to 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.720
 record them the games of present 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.160
 a little slow 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.950
 in this game for doing it 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.360
 but 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:10.169
 as you can see, they surpass as a little 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.169
 for anpe laden 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.850
 As you all know 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.250
 plus 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.550
 we do this 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.390
 because we think it is useless 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.390
 to do that 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.420
 come come now yes now we would be 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.600
 speakers as for backwards and 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.280
 fatalist tÃ¡riq 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.840
 no more 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.840
 come do not take troha 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.940
 by the east
