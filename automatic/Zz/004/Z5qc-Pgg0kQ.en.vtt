00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.870
 please you see here 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.800
 great hamas is the housewife has no 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.450
 It has been that it could cause 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.549
 will compete slipper think it's better 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 she is quiet, that's what she can do 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.199
 show in the head 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 There you rest, the housewife reveals. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.840
 can do that you are simulating the same 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 thing with the slipper without any problem 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.929
 So we can do both workouts. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.460
 At home she wants to spend more calories 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.079
 you can not do that knee 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.829
 jumping over here 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.230
 This is what we are doing. 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.940
 we call the cyclic wants to lose the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 contact with the soil how long I 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.289
 I calculate there stops and let's talk about 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 of series and repetitions to look nice 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.550
 for the home staff to understand each 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.949
 movement that we have done here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.670
 bodybuilding and functional make 10 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.760
 repetitions at 10 repetitive is good and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.420
 active rest do 30 seconds of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 active rest and return to movement 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.229
 we will make four series being four 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 times 10 repetitions and finished the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 train when four times you go 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.799
 to be panty 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.270
 Have you ever felt the different muscles? 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 I think the disposition of the person also 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 goes including this three times a week 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.570
 as he spoke without exaggerating 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 Our team is doing very well and will 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.049
 health will improve the quality of life and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.479
 will improve functional movements 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.509
 that she'll be able to climb a ladder 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.000
 how would performance be that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.159
 even the person who is older 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.530
 you will be able to upload a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.420
 ladder quietly she will not 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.399
 spend so much energy it will have energy 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.740
 to know if the ladder but to walk 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.079
 For everything you will have at your disposal if 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.710
 ask is this rug here is a dream 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.530
 or another will not stay 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.619
 today this carpet here that we have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 any and every sport shop 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.530
 You'll be looking for your 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.520
 search for training equipment 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 functional than mayana 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.349
 We ask Lindsay, she wants to know if 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.729
 I liked to have some more 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.230
 times to go 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.330
 But what happens is that we have one more 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.819
 little time is good as most we can 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.590
 here is cool but for me the movement 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.959
 composed please 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.910
 these would be more advanced but it is a 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.160
 caloric expenditure absurd that andré vai 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.030
 Are you doing more for me with the background? 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.879
 So here you stand and play 15 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.610
 I do not know what to do but sinks s O is 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.190
 very good for the blush it looks nice 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.329
 Because this proposal is legal, she does not 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.040
 need to rest 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.709
 You will be doing a gym 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.819
 people were going to do bottom-up and exit 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.910
 rest rests biceps rest 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.349
 There you are wasting time is interesting to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.900
 people spend calories 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.560
 obviously depends on the purpose of each 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.930
 one 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.700
 if the person wants more this hypertrophy 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.380
 it is not the most indicated training 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 This is a perfect workout for 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.470
 weight loss is all that people 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.480
 it's happening people are here 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.109
 very interested at home 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.819
 the fabiana neighbor she wants to know if she 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.530
 Can you make anp? 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.019
 only she just had it and made a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.420
 cesarean section only makes only two months 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.299
 Wifey wants to come back soon, does not have it. 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.850
 It's really cool this subject where you can even 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.900
 see a bodybuilder then né post 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.600
 pregnancy 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.579
 the interesting addition to her day anp 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.829
 is doing this activity that already 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.130
 would be an activity that requires an 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.840
 greater caloric requirement requires greater force 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.799
 It is important that she works the muscles 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.319
 functionally the muscles that will 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:45.280
 stabilizing the movement without the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.530
 champi after she comes back with chance is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.709
 because first of all she could 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.720
 she did but she did she had a period 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.880
 that it has changed the entire center of gravity 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.220
 body is the physiological part then 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.010
 she will have to rescue all this part 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.139
 body's physiology again to 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.190
 able to make the move understands the 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.190
 flu can do 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.000
 ahead, talking and talking. 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.140
 same brigade for you serve more for 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.570
 here the scenario was captured on the 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.850
 brigade is very nice to see that today has 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.040
 this combination, everybody stopped 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.560
 that archaic thing to rest 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.960
 nice and anyway we have many 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.090
 resources and I think it's cool that 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.160
 functional training in addition to letting people 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.500
 with the legal body I feel that people 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.530
 gets healthier people are is 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.080
 with another face it does not stay is too much is 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.990
 incredible second study of the tape too 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.420
 for those who like challenges like speech 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.120
 It's a wonder you challenge yourself, you see. 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.220
 then its limits in the beginning is difficult is 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.770
 I will not play've done training 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.200
 functional and I speak for testimony 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.880
 own at first shakes the whole body 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.070
 but then you will see the result of 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.540
 a way sometimes in the goal in the mirror 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.330
 so strain looks at your belly already 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.850
 different your shapely leg is a 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.580
 wonder then take it goes back go behind 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.770
 because it's too much and it's going to 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.770
 so give the result you expect
