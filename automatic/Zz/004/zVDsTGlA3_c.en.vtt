00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.260
 Hello Ni Gion last year's store is the product to meet today pb 4 days pb 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.220
 Monitor tag 85 is the best 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.270
 The size of the monitor is 28 in front of me, so I can fit it well. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.650
 It's a product. 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.000
 If you are interested in more of your aunt, the monitor will solve the TV problem. 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.080
 You'll hear it. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.080
 But first let's look at the Samsung Electronics ts 8th 5th floor bottle as TV 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.699
 t2 18: 570 is almost the same as normal TV and usage 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.570
 You might think 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.570
 If you use Samsung TV, the interface is more familiar. 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.339
 One of the first things you should check when using your monitor as a TV is 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.790
 I'm going to relax . I see a lot of people together. 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.659
 Unlike the immersion, watching from various angles is that the TV 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.979
 Because 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:06.200
 Then you do not have to worry about Samsung's p 28c 570 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:10.130
 It disappears. 578 Soshien furniture makes it look good at the angle of thumb. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.479
 I choose you by mv rather than tn panel which I separated from view angle anyway 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.439
 Give me a percentile 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.430
 Here you can tr at the same time while using the computer with the tr function 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.570
 I have. 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.570
 I think it's useful for those who steal school smoke in the office . 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.560
 So if you do not have an antenna at 30 and you do not see the TV, 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.969
 Let's make a beauty antenna. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 It 's a wire hanger and an antenna cable that you do not have at home . 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:54.299
 Once you've removed the hanger, make it square and turn off both ends. 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.560
 And antenna angle off the coated second roll of each end of the cable hanger 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.560
 If you will be completed three chapters 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.489
 Let's take a look at the role of monitor this time. 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:22.290
 Well, the design of Samsung 8: 570 is really simple. 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:25.620
 In the office or in the study room and well worth mingling throughout throughout personally euron brilliant 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.310
 Design rather than design like this design is preferred monitor 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.450
 It's more about focusing on sales in the monitor than on the look of design . 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.450
 It's important. It's five years old. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.889
 International Institute archipelago called the 2nd Law o also see the quality collected into play when 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.889
 Writing you 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.470
 This enables the charges to sub 1 hdmi 2 of the Large and Perth 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.090
 I can say that connection is a great asset. 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.769
 Here is a simple mhl feature has become a smart phone 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.769
 Connected and sponsored 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.739
 And with the connecter function, you do not turn on your pc 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.739
 Files can just keep movie music with ease 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.560
 Recently, Ryu Hyun-jin's major league expenses and Korean baseball post season 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.190
 There are many people who are enthusiastic. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.670
 Next year, the 2014 Brazil World Cup is going on. 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.579
 So you can watch tv quickly while you use your computer TV 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.780
 There are a lot of people who are thirsty on the monitor. 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:36.090
 If you like 18:00 0 column lacquer computer and watch tv two 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.769
 I wonder if I can catch all the rabbits. 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.769
