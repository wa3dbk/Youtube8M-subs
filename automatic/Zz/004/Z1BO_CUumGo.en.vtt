00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 one of the biggest advances with respect 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.549
 to the first record has been mostly in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.740
 technical aspects such as the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.599
 audio card that I had before 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 two channels and now they worry about two 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 rack units and has also led us to 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.690
 have to change our way of doing 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.400
 the music because all the programs of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.230
 audio editing have also changed and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 well that is reflected I think that the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.699
 music especially in the greater 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 number of tracks and now we have included 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.050
 instruments like the spirit remove the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.480
 ukulele a little more percussion 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
 complete and then also regarding 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.970
 color sound much more 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.370
 in the instrumentation we are well 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.830
 one disc for another the sound to candelo 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.380
 a lot is seen on guitars for a 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.790
 more powerful sound more bones look more 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.590
 defined a battery is also seen 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.140
 much more defined and the piano and although 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.200
 is much rounder much richer in 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.510
 general disk is more continent the 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.800
 Chinese holidays are gone or slow 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.440
 and nothing like that but 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.570
 we just wanted a little with 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.120
 calm work at your pressures 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.860
 nothing is of your deadlines which is something 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.170
 what happened to us on the first disc 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.050
 that's why we do not like to give now 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.510
 same an exact date although never 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.310
 know the lyrics of this album follows the 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.050
 same dynamic of the previous one are very 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 positive and also example how 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.310
 it's a pretty complete album to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.160
 my way of seeing because it fits very well 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 the slow subjects the fastest and I think 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.220
 that's all pretty well 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.260
 balanced on the disk there is a there is a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.830
 theme that you already know and we also know 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.040
 what 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.040
 pretty good we've been a little 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 I remembered one day that my name was Denis for 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.900
 record their voices and well we were all 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 the afternoon working because it was also 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 one was a subject that had ten lines of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.520
 voice for many takes and the thing is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.740
 complicated and it became long and then 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.890
 ended days with the voice burst done 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.880
 made the criticism called impact 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880
 quite back 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 4 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.390
