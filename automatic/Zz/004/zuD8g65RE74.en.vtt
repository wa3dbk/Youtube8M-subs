so<00:00:00.359> before<00:00:00.900> we<00:00:01.020> begin<00:00:01.140> fitting<00:00:01.650> let's<00:00:02.040> take<00:00:02.280> a

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so before we begin fitting let's take a

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.230 
so before we begin fitting let's take a
look<00:00:02.550> at<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.790> horse

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
look at the horse

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.630 
look at the horse
this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.570> wizz<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.170> four<00:00:04.710> year<00:00:04.859> old<00:00:05.009> Hanoverian
