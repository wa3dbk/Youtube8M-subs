pass and a good long shot on him as well
so<00:02:32.810> i<00:02:33.250> definitely<00:02:34.250> recommend<00:02:34.460> getting<00:02:34.850> him

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
so i definitely recommend getting him

so i definitely recommend getting him
even<00:02:35.540> he<00:02:35.840> probably<00:02:35.900> better<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.470> composition<00:02:37.070> a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
even he probably better in composition a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.400 
even he probably better in composition a
different<00:02:37.490> formation<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.200> last

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
different formation and then the last

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.930 
different formation and then the last
sentiment<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.040> have<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.340> best<00:02:40.370> midfielder

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
sentiment we have is the best midfielder

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.670 
sentiment we have is the best midfielder
of<00:02:41.060> one<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.750> best<00:02:41.870> bronze<00:02:42.200> midfielders

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
of one of the best bronze midfielders

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.590 
of one of the best bronze midfielders
overall<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.760> gary<00:02:44.000> gardener<00:02:44.420> he's

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
overall and that is gary gardener he's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.449 
overall and that is gary gardener he's
got<00:02:44.810> an<00:02:44.930> amazing<00:02:45.050> long<00:02:45.620> shot<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.070> my<00:02:46.220> opinion

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
got an amazing long shot in my opinion

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.060 
got an amazing long shot in my opinion
he's<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.790> bronze<00:02:47.030> jared<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.600> he<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.650> unleash

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
he's the bronze jared and he can unleash

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.590 
he's the bronze jared and he can unleash
the<00:02:49.220> kraken<00:02:49.550> from<00:02:49.730> absolute<00:02:50.150> anywhere<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
the kraken from absolute anywhere on the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.900 
the kraken from absolute anywhere on the
pitch<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:51.050> yes<00:02:51.680> 76<00:02:52.130> shoot<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.610> think<00:02:52.820> he's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.370 
pitch is yes 76 shoot and I think he's
got<00:02:53.030> eight<00:02:53.180> yard<00:02:53.420> long<00:02:53.600> shot<00:02:53.840> which<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.110> very
