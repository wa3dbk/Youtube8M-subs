00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.790
 my first review in the minecraft 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.429
 pocket edition yes, I'm the first one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.950
 your turn north before we probably 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.230
 already recognized the title so that is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.820
 say there are two different ramos 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.560
 namely once the fire in your 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 always runs which means you can watch 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 Do not pick if he likes him or not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.849
 but you always run for it 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.520
 pretty fast or the other place where 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 you only run when you double on the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 forward button presses so when 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.160
 normal minecraft saves then 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 just not that fast but me 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.280
 actually find it advantageous I 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 but show you now still times both 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 Of course you need a grid for that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.980
 break the device like this and then you go up 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.980
 cydia 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 cancel abort ok then cancel 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.880
 do you swell up and swell up like that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.110
 then adds that source but that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.950
 that will be in the description again 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.090
 so do not panic and there 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.110
 then you install mbps printing her 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.880
 you will probably be back 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.020
 why I did not install it myself 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.650
 I have that in another way 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.040
 made on safari only that's a lot 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.330
 heavier and more elaborate and you were me 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.110
 I do not know how to do it again 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.850
 can delete 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.310
 so here is simply that their that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.750
 It would be a lot easier if it had then 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.130
 you go he goes in the most 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.550
 politically I 'm doing this easy now 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.550
 fast 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.090
 so and as you can see i can quite 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.200
 normal is now a bit can 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 Unfortunately, I do not change it now 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.280
 one should see, I can be quite normal 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.750
 but when I double here 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.490
 presses can I sprint 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.070
 So it's really very much 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.370
 very practical and now we come 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.510
 where we run throughout the second since 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.750
 to go one more time in the studio 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.750
 in 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.900
 so also from the same source 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.220
 then you install mgp page and parents 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.610
 if you do then you have a will 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.590
 new icon on your device here the mcp 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.310
 bad luck you can the monster 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 download and to find the mods 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.720
 which you can download here you have to 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.819
 safari and this page open minecraft 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 pocket blabla but that will be synonymous again 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.220
 The description is therefore no panic 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.459
 so and i do that completely then that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.870
 the great side probably knows that 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.549
 everyone that minecraft forum 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.890
 and here you can see 6.0 6.1 mods and picks 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.920
 So there are synonymous or version version 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.700
 for those who do not have the new ones 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.569
 whatever reason 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.329
 then you go to show that lasts now 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:39.629
 with me a little bit because I'm straight 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:46.599
 record and take it open 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:50.889
 Twelve open to the public 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.200
 not bad now either 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.919
 okay here are the whole mods 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.230
 listed in the version 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:02.340
 bla bla bla and here you see the robot 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.340
 Here you go again to show 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.439
 and there comes this link you click 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:14.560
 longer and then goes to copy 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:17.560
 then you go in mcp ketch rhine goes 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.180
 here on downloader and paste the left 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.849
 quite simply 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.330
 and then go to download then 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:27.849
 then that appears new model is then 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.930
 is in here it and I have the 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.750
 two even think about it enough to stop already 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.280
 Before that, I just had it this way 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.419
 i do it now i was able to do that 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.639
 but not you 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.260
 demonstrate because I'm the others 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.690
 ort have installed and because I do not 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.710
 I know how to install them 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.550
 Unfortunately, do not do that now 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.340
 demonstrate 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.990
 but if you go down here 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.310
 Applying for patch then it is 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.840
 patched if you then again on it 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.760
 go and apply offpage then it is 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.680
 normal again and definitely if 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.300
 you have the answer then you really run 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.849
 incredibly fast in the world and the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.229
 World is pretty distorted too 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.669
 Most may know that 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.220
 if you have normal minecraft playing this 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:08.289
 fv show because we as that would be pretty 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.759
 high yes and that was it already 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.610
 with the review I hope you have it 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.250
 liked commented and if liked 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.560
 I like my channel but please 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.120
 to abo there and if you want me 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.800
 then do more of these murder reviews 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.419
 Write it in the comments 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.950
 yes, and we'll see each other then 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.450
 maybe next time 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.900
 and I say goodbye already 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.900
 People
