00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.250
 building material wall blocks 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.099
 eurocom developed technology 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.679
 receiving light large pore concrete of 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.550
 multi-purpose significantly accelerates 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.830
 and cheapens 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.859
 construction of enclosing structures and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.050
 make a revolution in construction 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.850
 production unit eurocom we started three 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.859
 years ago this innovative 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 technology he helps to reduce 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.960
 the cost of construction work is 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 about 30-40 percent with 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.610
 construction is not necessary 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.730
 do exterior trim like god 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.500
 already has an outer decorative layer 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.020
 durable in your masked color 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.390
 that is, it is beautiful it is aesthetic except 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.640
 addition we get quite smooth 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.430
 inner wall surface which 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 also saves costs 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.899
 finishing materials god possesses 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 excellent heat engineering 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.550
 characteristics that do not allow 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.160
 make installation of insulation wall 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.379
 Euro blocks can have the highest 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.250
 load bearing strength 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.710
 is 22.4 kilograms per centimeter 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.540
 square making them sought after 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 and the most optimal wall 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.570
 construction material 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.939
 houses and cottages 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 such blocks are made on imported 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.020
 equipment is the raw material for them 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 lightweight and durable ceramic concrete 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.640
 which basis make 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 ceramic clay balls material 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.380
 today passed the tests of all the leading 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.960
 universities including one of the gate infusions of his 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 Story showed that upon receipt of 40 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.659
 centimeters reduced resistance 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.210
 heat transfer 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.970
 close 4 shower both wired 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 tends to 009 but never the less 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.040
 the material has their constructive 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 lities being his mark of 35 or above 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.550
 I and durable and the body than another threatens 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.280
 just not 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.290
 thanks to this absolutely eco-friendly 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.480
 the filler formed mixture at 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.850
 manufacturing eurocom wall blocks 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.000
 has a specific internal structure 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.020
 with very useful monavie properties 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 than these thinnest strata 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 milk color their thickness up to 2 tenths 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 millimeter of it is fantastic 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.290
 we started getting the result yesterday 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 two to three times easier cement consumption 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 decreased to 100 120 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 and plus to this the most important indicator 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.810
 this is low thermal conductivity 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.700
 track 0 children advantage wall 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.370
 eurocom blocks high degree 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.709
 fire resistance thermal conductivity comparable 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.050
 one hundred percent wood with heat conductivity 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.250
 environmental friendliness hygienic low 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.310
 sorption capacity 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.180
 no dew point and good 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.700
 breathability that decides on 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.940
 today the actual problem of oxygen 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.900
 fasting home maintenance experience 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.100
 show that maybe not even the rulers 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.470
 so good not breathe 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.540
 eurocom it is absolutely eco-friendly there 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.480
 warm truth is warm but i mean 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.790
 still the most important wall blocks 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.160
 eurocom allow refuse 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.260
 use of short-lived and harmful 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.420
 fire hazardous polymeric heaters 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.769
 because they do not need warming 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.840
 and cladding 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.090
 This allows for the construction of walls 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.220
 avoid extra time and 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.799
 funds in wall blocks 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.530
 eurocom passed all the tests and already 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.019
 certified we got an award on 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.510
 mix is better than you 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.400
 technology which company 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.590
 thanks to our eurocom block 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.810
 unique achievement for builders 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.709
 which allows us today to be built in 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.290
 any season 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.290
 houses that are already built as private 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.239
 so and high-rise and many apartment 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.610
 showed that construction time is not 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.670
 more than two or three but in separate court 4 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.290
 fully finished eurocom company 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.049
 the only enterprise that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.359
 produces wall blocks industrial 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.159
 scales here is a full cycle 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.620
 production of large pore blocks 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.930
 expanded clay concrete equipment 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.390
 and fully automated process 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.989
 allow you to reduce the cost of the finished 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.269
 products 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.299
 cheaper than other building materials wall 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.909
 eurocom blocks makes and the very raw materials for their 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.730
 production is a natural material 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.810
 clay deposits which is so rich in land 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.699
 Moscow region in 2012 we received an order 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.190
 the city ​​of teeth on the air 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.199
 began was a soloist in April and in November 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.760
 he was put in love settled and live there 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.250
 already 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.300
 more than two years the end of April was here 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.700
 excavated trench 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.830
 first october i think we 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.470
 the main work we will have done and 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.510
 30,000 square another example 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.270
 the four-story house is already directly 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.540
 was built in four months 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.060
 August 31 at the beginning of the separation pit and 31 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.450
 December already 160 people drove 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.420
 survey of residents who live in houses 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.120
 built from eurocom block showed that 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.010
 pay two to three times people began 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.610
 less for heating and we can talk 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.280
 about the type of efficient building we already 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.780
 today has 30 years of cost reduction 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.850
 responsible energy specific 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.460
 fuel per square meter at times 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.190
 possesses technical characteristics and 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.370
 advantages wall blocks reduce the cost 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.230
 construction 35-40 percent that 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.410
 meets the objectives 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.660
 Russian government in 2009 and 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.730
 allows an expert to state that 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.980
 Today, builders have technology 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.980
 build really affordable and 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.600
 expert housing 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.370
 reduce the cost of housing by 20 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.410
 percent 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.470
 make a standard mortgage payment 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.380
 appropriate fun product 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.920
 affordable to more than one million 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.920
 walk home
