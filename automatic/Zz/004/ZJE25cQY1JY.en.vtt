00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
tabs so you get the second memory out

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:13.710 
tabs so you get the second memory out
carefully<00:03:01.680> carefully

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:44.119 

sounds<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.780> little<00:03:15.050> harder<00:03:17.410> goes

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
get that out and get our new memory got

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:55.259 
get that out and get our new memory got
8<00:03:48.400> gigabytes<00:03:48.969> here<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.560> four<00:03:50.950> gig<00:03:51.219> Dems<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.730> be

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.879 

there's<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.379> second<00:04:08.799> one<00:04:10.290> that's<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.590> now

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
there's the second one that's it now
