00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.990 
seconds and he core John does the thing
around<00:01:51.780> every<00:01:52.049> minute<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> 30<00:01:53.520> seconds

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
around every minute so the 30 seconds

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.430 
around every minute so the 30 seconds
kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> varies<00:01:54.690> because<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
kind of varies because you know you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.380 
kind of varies because you know you
can't<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> too<00:01:56.610> early<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
can't do it too early because then you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
can't do it too early because then you
won't<00:01:57.510> have<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.080> next<00:01:58.229> time<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:59.010> struggled

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
won't have it the next time we struggled

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
won't have it the next time we struggled
with<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.210> bit<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.720> ended

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
with this for a little bit but we ended

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870 
with this for a little bit but we ended
up<00:02:01.020> figuring<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.340> yeah<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> really

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
up figuring it out but yeah I really

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.460 
up figuring it out but yeah I really
