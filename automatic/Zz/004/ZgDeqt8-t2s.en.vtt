hoping you'll show everyone just how it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.130 
hoping you'll show everyone just how it
works

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
works

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
works
so<00:00:25.140> yes<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.680> liquid<00:00:26.070> field<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.640> fact<00:00:26.820> it's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
so yes it's a liquid field in fact it's

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.110 
so yes it's a liquid field in fact it's
oil<00:00:27.330> field<00:00:28.010> like<00:00:29.010> comparable<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> compass

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
oil field like comparable to a compass

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.650 
oil field like comparable to a compass
the<00:00:33.120> dial<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.649> dial<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.250> working<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> little

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the dial the dial is is working a little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.410 
the dial the dial is is working a little
bit<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> original<00:00:38.760> designs

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
bit like the like the original designs

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860 
bit like the like the original designs
so<00:00:39.989> no<00:00:40.290> hands<00:00:40.770> everything<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.239> plane

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
so no hands everything in one plane

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.580 
so no hands everything in one plane
this<00:00:43.590> watch<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:44.309> from<00:00:44.910> 2d<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.420> 3d<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
this watch is going from 2d to 3d so the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.979 
this watch is going from 2d to 3d so the
the<00:00:47.340> dial<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.850> curved

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the dial is curved

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.410 
the dial is curved
it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.350> convex<00:00:49.770> dial<00:00:51.739> new<00:00:52.739> functions<00:00:53.420> hours

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's a convex dial new functions hours

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
it's a convex dial new functions hours
minutes<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.280> also<00:00:56.520> have

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
minutes that's the same you also have

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.860 
minutes that's the same you also have
the<00:00:57.030> weekday<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.989> will<00:00:58.680> show<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.870> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the weekday I will show you here you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
the weekday I will show you here you
have<00:01:01.350> seconds<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> date

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
have seconds here and you have a date

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.270 
have seconds here and you have a date
indication<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.549> does<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> work<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.900> watch

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
indication so how does it work the watch

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.990 
indication so how does it work the watch
has<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.060> high<00:01:09.390> contrast<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.380> dial

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
has a very very high contrast to dial

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
has a very very high contrast to dial
like<00:01:12.680> black<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.920> white<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:16.500> comes<00:01:16.799> because

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
like black on white this comes because

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.300 
like black on white this comes because
the<00:01:17.610> oil<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.330> taking<00:01:18.810> away<00:01:19.070> completely<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the oil is taking away completely the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.500 
the oil is taking away completely the
refraction<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.420> glasses

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
refraction of the glasses

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.630 
refraction of the glasses
and<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.870> air<00:01:24.140> in<00:01:24.440> between<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.920> dial<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
and the air in between the dial and the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.350 
and the air in between the dial and the
glass<00:01:28.090> sure<00:01:29.090> sure<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.660> works<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:31.180> this<00:01:32.180> is

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
glass sure sure that works so this is

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.390 
glass sure sure that works so this is
the<00:01:32.480> back<00:01:32.660> of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.930> watch<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:34.130> will<00:01:34.280> have

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
the back of the watch you will have

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.390 
the back of the watch you will have
noticed<00:01:34.820> there<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.030> no<00:01:35.300> crown<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:36.020> watch

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
noticed there is no crown on this watch

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.880 
noticed there is no crown on this watch
so<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.580> setup<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.540> done<00:01:38.780> by<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.050> Sapphire<00:01:39.710> on

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
so the setup is done by the Sapphire on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.510 
so the setup is done by the Sapphire on
the<00:01:40.130> back<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:42.350> watch<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.680> automatic<00:01:43.310> so

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the back the watch is automatic so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.830 
the back the watch is automatic so
there's<00:01:43.910> still<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.570> rotor<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:47.510> ring

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
there's still a rotor in the as a ring

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.800 
there's still a rotor in the as a ring
is<00:01:49.270> indicating<00:01:50.320> p24<00:01:51.320> prototype<00:01:51.890> -<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.630> will

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
is indicating p24 prototype - this will

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.110 
is indicating p24 prototype - this will
be<00:01:53.840> replaced<00:01:54.260> in<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.650> production<00:01:54.980> watches<00:01:55.880> by

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
be replaced in the production watches by

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.969 
be replaced in the production watches by
the<00:01:56.180> number<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.990> watch<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.590> serial

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
the number of the watch the serial

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.920 
the number of the watch the serial
number<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.520> watch<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.940> show<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.750> how<00:01:59.870> you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
number of the watch the show is how you

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.719 
number of the watch the show is how you
adjust<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.500> time<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.950> how<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.100> want<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.640> how

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
adjust the time and how you want and how

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.120 
adjust the time and how you want and how
you<00:02:01.760> want<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.120> wind<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.560> wind<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.979> watch

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
you want to wind it so to wind the watch

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.660 
you want to wind it so to wind the watch
you<00:02:05.000> turn<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.510> back<00:02:05.710> with<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:07.070> triangle

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
you turn the back with this triangle

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.930 
you turn the back with this triangle
here<00:02:08.030> from<00:02:08.600> here<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.110> there<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.590> want<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.580> so

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
here from here to there you want it so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.130 
here from here to there you want it so
you<00:02:11.000> go<00:02:11.330> kind<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.290> oscillations<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:14.140> to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
you go kind of oscillations like that to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.160 
you go kind of oscillations like that to
set<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.470> date<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.490> continue<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.959> go

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
set the date you have to continue you go

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.770 
set the date you have to continue you go
into<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.800> date<00:02:18.980> position<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.180> add<00:02:20.360> one

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
into the date position and you add one

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.050 
into the date position and you add one
day<00:02:21.020> or<00:02:21.230> two<00:02:21.290> days<00:02:21.530> whatever<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.400> want<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.910> do

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
day or two days whatever you want to do

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.430 
day or two days whatever you want to do
and<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:26.090> set<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.510> time<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.990> have<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> go

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
and then to set the time you have to go

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.160 
and then to set the time you have to go
back<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.070> running<00:02:28.640> position<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.450> go<00:02:30.020> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
back to the running position and go the
