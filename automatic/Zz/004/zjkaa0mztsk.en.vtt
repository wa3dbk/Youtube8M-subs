00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Come back, you jerk!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So! Lasus comes, puts on the crash helmet. Cause we have here this
beautiful ETZ 250 Delux. It's Delux, cause this is a Delux. It is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
special compared to a normal ETZ 250. Otherwise I never understood
why, cause I think it's roughly the same like the normal ETZ 250.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Maybe this back iron. But I'm not sure it's factory.
Whatever. Ballsy, try to push it out to the yard

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we go to the end of the village and back and the kids can
see how it works. We are worried about one thing already that 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we poured in it only 3/4 l petrol, cause it's all we have.
Otherwise the motor has a valid MOT test, so that's why we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
are so brave. Naa! That's why we're so brave. I pull its ass if you
think. So that's why we're so brave that we ride with it to the end

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of the village and back, cause it has valid MOT test and although
it doesn't stand in the other name yet, but in theory it's 2 weeks for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
using the motor with valid insurance.
So, take it a little, till I put on my crash helmet!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But record a video, not just keep it at random! Not the sun and the
woods, fuck, but this beautiful motor! Well okay, give it back!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Roll down nicely and then... Is the key in it? - Yep. - Well, show
the kids that first we get to suck the motor with this half dl

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000
petrol what's in it. One more,right! We give the ignition.
Open the fuel cock. This is what I'm talking about.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I wonder if the gate is open. Whatever.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This box is good, I just can't sit on normally because of it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So! The machine needs a little warm up, cause...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
As I see, László wants to take us to the field. He thinks it's a
good idea. - No, we go out here. - What? - Easier to go out.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Is the gate open? Ha-haa.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Ohh, fuck it!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Turn the lamp on!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, we go with 50 km/h, cause we comply with the rules.
You can see, all of the dial gages are working.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We can stop here. - What? - Stop!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
- Should I stop? - Yep, stop!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Well. - … - What?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So the motor has one failure otherwise, although
Lacus will say it's not true. - Cause it's not true.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 - I know you'll say this, but it has one failure. When
somebody shifts to 5... - It shifts immediately for me.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Okay, I thought that for you immediately, but when somebody shifts
to 5, then he/she can't always switch it back from 5 to 4 and it's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
possible just when you wisely pull the gas and it
simply just jumps out of it. You were lucky now.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The problem is that the 5. cogwheel or the auxiliary cogwheel next
to it is frayed. But when we disassemble the block - cause it will

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
be disassembled, because of it otherwise -, then it will come out, but otherwise
– and let's show it the tv viewer kids – everything's working on it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Direction indicator, now then... Direction indicators.
Right. One. Other. So, other. Why don't you do it?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Well, okay. Right. There flashes the direction indicator.
We'll see the rears too and the brake-lamp too, cause 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:06.000
this is right this way. The other? Right. Brake-light? It lights,
yes. Turn it off! So this is rarely a technically perfect motor.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We didn't have a motor like this, really, seriously. 
All of them had something wrong and this is a

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
motorbike that is totally good in traffic, but it happened
that we didn't succeed to get one patchy, without papers,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
so from this you're gonna get accessory parts.
But in exchange everything's alright on it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Well, I say goodbye, bye!
