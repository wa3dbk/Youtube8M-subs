robot colors day because I guess
everyone<00:01:30.720> thinks<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.079> they're<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.229> very

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
everyone thinks that they're very very

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.469 
everyone thinks that they're very very
very<00:01:31.799> comparable<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.060> was<00:01:33.180> talking<00:01:33.299> with

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
very comparable and I was talking with

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
very comparable and I was talking with
that<00:01:33.659> later<00:01:33.990> can't<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.530> ok<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.280> anyway<00:01:35.400> I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that later can't we do ok so anyway I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.030 
that later can't we do ok so anyway I
gotta<00:01:36.570> pump<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> here's<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> consistency<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
gotta pump so here's the consistency and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.499 
gotta pump so here's the consistency and
you<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.820> very<00:01:42.030> liquidy

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you can see that it's not very liquidy

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
you can see that it's not very liquidy
at<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:44.329> little<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.810> thick<00:01:46.229> with

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
at all a little but it's not thick with

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
at all a little but it's not thick with
that<00:01:47.340> makes<00:01:47.520> sense<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> blend<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that makes sense so when you blend it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.060 
that makes sense so when you blend it
and<00:01:49.470> I'm<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.860> NC<00:01:50.189> 40<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.960> once<00:01:52.229> oh<00:01:52.409> look<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:52.979> this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and I'm an NC 40 it once oh look at this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
and I'm an NC 40 it once oh look at this
