me<00:00:20.400> using<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.000> emulator<00:00:21.890> definitely<00:00:22.890> did<00:00:23.039> see

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
me using a emulator definitely did see

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.439 
me using a emulator definitely did see
me<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.670> emulator<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.330> what

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
me using an emulator because that's what

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.849 
me using an emulator because that's what
I<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.660> using<00:00:24.900> um<00:00:25.519> that<00:00:26.519> will<00:00:26.760> give<00:00:27.029> you

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
I was using um that will give you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.089 
I was using um that will give you
exactly<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.480> ti-84<00:00:30.480> calculator<00:00:30.800> that<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.920> can

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
exactly a ti-84 calculator that you can

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.540 
exactly a ti-84 calculator that you can
just<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.030> mouse<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.989> input<00:00:34.380> data<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.829> do

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
just use your mouse to input data and do

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
just use your mouse to input data and do
computations<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.690> whatnot<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> first

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
computations and whatnot so the first

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.560 
computations and whatnot so the first
thing<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.790> open<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.270> web

written on it so go ahead and hit

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
written on it so go ahead and hit
download<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.600> its<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:07.070> download

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
download so it can do its thing download

and<00:01:33.180> do<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.049> most<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.380> us<00:01:34.470> what

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and do that but for most of us what

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
and do that but for most of us what
we're<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> click<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> last
