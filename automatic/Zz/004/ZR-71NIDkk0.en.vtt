okay<00:00:00.989> I'm<00:00:01.380> making<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.949> video<00:00:03.319> to<00:00:04.319> answer<00:00:04.500> a

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
okay I'm making this video to answer a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.369 
okay I'm making this video to answer a
request<00:00:05.250> that<00:00:05.520> was<00:00:05.609> given<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> me<00:00:06.210> to

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
request that was given to me to

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.560 
request that was given to me to
demonstrate<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.950> could<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.340> difference<00:00:08.670> or

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
demonstrate if I could the difference or

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.259 
demonstrate if I could the difference or
the<00:00:09.719> benefits<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.469> are<00:00:11.280> attained<00:00:12.150> by

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the benefits that are attained by

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.160 
the benefits that are attained by
running<00:00:12.540> lie<00:00:13.170> instead<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.920> baking<00:00:14.250> soda<00:00:14.429> so

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
running lie instead of baking soda so

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.010 
running lie instead of baking soda so
what<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.289> see<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.449> two<00:00:18.449> stainless<00:00:18.869> steel

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
what you see here is two stainless steel

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
what you see here is two stainless steel
generators<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.890> very<00:00:20.760> very<00:00:21.119> inefficient

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
generators a very very inefficient

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.740 
generators a very very inefficient
design<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.460> only<00:00:23.640> reason<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.300> using<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.720> here

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
design the only reason I'm using it here

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
design the only reason I'm using it here
is<00:00:26.300> for<00:00:27.300> demonstration<00:00:27.960> purposes<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.769> that's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is for demonstration purposes and that's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.799 
is for demonstration purposes and that's
what<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> had<00:00:29.900> two<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> shop<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.949> so

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
what I had two of in the shop here so

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.740 
what I had two of in the shop here so
the<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.610> running<00:00:35.610> 3/4<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the one on the right is running 3/4 of a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.590 
the one on the right is running 3/4 of a
teaspoon<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.710> lye<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> one<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> Left<00:00:39.000> 3/4

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
teaspoon of lye the one on the Left 3/4

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.880 
teaspoon of lye the one on the Left 3/4
of<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> teaspoon<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.290> baking<00:00:40.530> soda<00:00:42.680> both<00:00:43.680> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
of a teaspoon of baking soda both of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.330 
of a teaspoon of baking soda both of
them<00:00:44.539> powered<00:00:45.539> by<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:46.020> 12-volt<00:00:46.829> battery<00:00:47.160> of

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
them powered by one 12-volt battery of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.119 
them powered by one 12-volt battery of
the<00:00:47.370> jumper<00:00:47.850> cables<00:00:47.879> run<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.890> connect<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the jumper cables run up connect to the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
the jumper cables run up connect to the
one<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> Left<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:50.940> 12-gauge<00:00:51.690> wire<00:00:51.960> run

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
one on the Left I have 12-gauge wire run

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.209 
one on the Left I have 12-gauge wire run
across<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:55.010> mm-hmm

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
across to the one on the right mm-hmm

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
across to the one on the right mm-hmm
so<00:00:56.430> both<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.059> receiving<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> same

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so both of them are receiving the same

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.590 
so both of them are receiving the same
amount<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.140> power<00:00:58.550> if<00:00:59.550> anything<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.449> on

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
amount of power if anything the one on

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
amount of power if anything the one on
the<00:01:00.690> left<00:01:00.899> might<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.289> receiving<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:02.010> bit

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the left might be receiving a little bit

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.119 
the left might be receiving a little bit
more<00:01:02.309> amperage<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.890> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
more amperage but as you can see it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.780 
more amperage but as you can see it's
certainly<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.909> helping<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:10.340> what<00:01:11.340> else<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
certainly not helping it what else can I

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
certainly not helping it what else can I
tell<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:15.590> baking<00:01:16.590> soda<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.979> my

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
tell you here the baking soda in my

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.749 
tell you here the baking soda in my
experience<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:19.220> turned<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:22.759> muddy

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
experience has turned out to be a muddy

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
experience has turned out to be a muddy
mess<00:01:23.880> after<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> run<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> while<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
mess after you run it for a while the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.940 
Arm &amp; Hammer brand I've been using turns
the<00:01:29.130> water<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> very<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.119> chocolate<00:01:30.689> color

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the water a very very chocolate color

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
the water a very very chocolate color
not<00:01:31.950> sure<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.150> baking<00:01:33.509> sodas

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
not sure if that's the baking sodas

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.190 
not sure if that's the baking sodas
fault<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.670> iron<00:01:36.479> leaching<00:01:37.079> out

I've<00:01:40.200> been<00:01:40.320> using<00:01:40.939> but<00:01:42.470> as<00:01:43.470> far<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.829> goes

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I've been using but as far as that goes

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.120 
I've been using but as far as that goes
