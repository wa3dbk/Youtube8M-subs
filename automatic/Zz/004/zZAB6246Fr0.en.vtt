I've had him for some time I got him
from<00:00:15.400> a<00:00:15.580> breeder<00:00:16.209> Roebuck<00:00:16.810> breeder<00:00:17.020> in

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
from a breeder Roebuck breeder in

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.270 
from a breeder Roebuck breeder in
Wolverhampton<00:00:18.250> which<00:00:18.850> is<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.029> big<00:00:19.660> city<00:00:19.870> in<00:00:20.080> the

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
Wolverhampton which is a big city in the

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.330 
Wolverhampton which is a big city in the
Midlands<00:00:21.280> and<00:00:22.530> look<00:00:23.530> at<00:00:23.650> this<00:00:23.800> full<00:00:24.310> length

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
Midlands and look at this full length

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.000 
Midlands and look at this full length
now<00:00:25.270> he<00:00:25.330> is<00:00:25.600> heterozygous<00:00:26.320> Albina<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.710> he's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
now he is heterozygous Albina so he's

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.639 
now he is heterozygous Albina so he's
50/50<00:00:30.699> which<00:00:30.880> means<00:00:31.119> that<00:00:31.420> half<00:00:31.660> of<00:00:31.810> his<00:00:31.869> genes

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
50/50 which means that half of his genes

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.040 
50/50 which means that half of his genes
Alba<00:00:33.070> I'll<00:00:33.609> be<00:00:33.820> know<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.059> other<00:00:34.180> half<00:00:34.359> normal

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
Alba I'll be know the other half normal

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.350 
Alba I'll be know the other half normal
the<00:00:35.890> normal<00:00:36.040> is<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.520> dominant<00:00:36.910> one<00:00:37.030> which<00:00:37.210> is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
the normal is the dominant one which is

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.750 
the normal is the dominant one which is
why<00:00:37.480> he<00:00:37.870> looks<00:00:38.050> normal<00:00:38.230> not<00:00:38.530> albino<00:00:38.920> but<00:00:39.550> if<00:00:39.640> I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
why he looks normal not albino but if I

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.180 
why he looks normal not albino but if I
pair<00:00:40.060> him<00:00:40.239> with<00:00:40.270> my<00:00:40.570> albino<00:00:41.230> snake<00:00:41.440> Phoenix

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
pair him with my albino snake Phoenix

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.580 
pair him with my albino snake Phoenix
who<00:00:42.399> will<00:00:42.550> see<00:00:42.700> in<00:00:42.790> another<00:00:42.880> video<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:44.500> I

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
who will see in another video then I

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.440 
who will see in another video then I
should<00:00:44.829> get<00:00:45.010> Alby<00:00:45.579> no<00:00:45.730> babies<00:00:46.059> which<00:00:46.270> would<00:00:46.390> be

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
should get Alby no babies which would be

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.319 
should get Alby no babies which would be
very<00:00:46.630> exciting<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.760> let's<00:00:49.059> have<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.180> little

you can see he's got a spot bulb to give
him<00:01:06.850> some<00:01:07.090> heat<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.659> comes<00:01:08.020> down<00:01:08.170> onto

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
him some heat and that comes down onto

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.170 
him some heat and that comes down onto
that<00:01:08.500> plastic<00:01:09.070> rock<00:01:09.280> now<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:09.970> rocks

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
that plastic rock now that rocks

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.730 
that plastic rock now that rocks
actually<00:01:10.540> Hollow<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:10.990> he<00:01:11.080> can<00:01:11.200> get<00:01:11.320> inside

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
actually Hollow so he can get inside

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.710 
actually Hollow so he can get inside
there<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.820> temperatures<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.510> keep

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
there and the temperatures that I keep

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.080 
there and the temperatures that I keep
him<00:01:13.900> at<00:01:14.049> are<00:01:14.500> 30<00:01:14.979> degrees<00:01:15.369> for<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.670> hot<00:01:15.790> spot

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
him at are 30 degrees for the hot spot

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.640 
him at are 30 degrees for the hot spot
and<00:01:16.510> then<00:01:16.750> as<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:16.990> can<00:01:17.140> see<00:01:17.200> he's<00:01:17.470> got<00:01:17.590> the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
and then as you can see he's got the

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.640 
and then as you can see he's got the
rest<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.280> tank<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.869> Hyden<00:01:20.229> if<00:01:20.350> he<00:01:20.439> wants

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
rest of the tank to to Hyden if he wants

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.039 
rest of the tank to to Hyden if he wants
to<00:01:20.770> get<00:01:20.890> away<00:01:20.979> from<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.369> heat<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.810> tank<00:01:23.020> is

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
to get away from the heat this tank is

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.660 
to get away from the heat this tank is
actually<00:01:23.350> just<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.590> modified<00:01:23.979> aquarium<00:01:24.549> I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
actually just a modified aquarium I

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.070 
actually just a modified aquarium I
bought<00:01:24.939> it<00:01:25.119> like<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.659> didn't<00:01:25.900> do<00:01:25.990> it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
bought it like this I didn't do it

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.929 
bought it like this I didn't do it
myself<00:01:26.260> but<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.159> see<00:01:27.340> they've<00:01:27.549> just<00:01:27.729> used

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
myself but you can see they've just used

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.690 
myself but you can see they've just used
aquarium<00:01:28.479> sealant<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:30.340> fix<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:33.250> fix<00:01:33.460> these

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
aquarium sealant to fix the to fix these

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.230 
aquarium sealant to fix the to fix these
bits<00:01:33.970> here<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:35.350> glass<00:01:35.650> bits<00:01:35.920> onto<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.430> onto

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
bits here these glass bits onto the onto

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.999 
bits here these glass bits onto the onto
the<00:01:37.450> inside<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.930> tank<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.229> quite<00:01:38.619> like<00:01:38.799> it

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
the inside of the tank I quite like it

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.160 
the inside of the tank I quite like it
it<00:01:39.159> makes<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.549> really<00:01:39.610> interesting<00:01:40.170> cage

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
it makes for a really interesting cage

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.850 
it makes for a really interesting cage
of<00:01:41.409> quite<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.590> dynamic<00:01:41.799> setup<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:44.650> it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
of quite a dynamic setup and it's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.109 
of quite a dynamic setup and it's
actually<00:01:45.130> where<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.280> used<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.610> keep<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.880> corn

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
actually where I used to keep the corn

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.300 
actually where I used to keep the corn
snake<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.170> Duke<00:01:47.409> when<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:48.250> first<00:01:48.579> got<00:01:48.790> him

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
snake the the Duke when I first got him

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.789 
snake the the Duke when I first got him
so<00:01:51.310> you'll<00:01:52.270> notice<00:01:52.450> I'm<00:01:52.630> using<00:01:52.720> Aspen<00:01:53.470> there's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
so you'll notice I'm using Aspen there's

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.039 
so you'll notice I'm using Aspen there's
two<00:01:54.100> reasons<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.759> firstly<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.810> looks

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
two reasons for this firstly it looks

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.429 
two reasons for this firstly it looks
quite<00:01:56.320> nice<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.970> sort<00:01:58.150> of<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.329> desert<00:01:59.170> II

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
quite nice this is sort of a desert II

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.350 
quite nice this is sort of a desert II
themed<00:01:59.799> cage<00:02:00.490> although<00:02:00.820> he<00:02:00.909> keeps<00:02:01.149> knocking

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
themed cage although he keeps knocking

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.469 
themed cage although he keeps knocking
over<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.930> bit<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:03.490> bit<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.759> poly

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
over this bit of this bit of poly

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.069 
over this bit of this bit of poly
background<00:02:04.960> here<00:02:05.939> hey<00:02:06.939> there<00:02:07.299> we<00:02:07.390> go<00:02:07.420> focus<00:02:07.960> is

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
background here hey there we go focus is

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.109 
background here hey there we go focus is
there<00:02:08.259> somewhere<00:02:08.649> he<00:02:09.549> keeps<00:02:09.670> knocking<00:02:09.879> that

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
there somewhere he keeps knocking that

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.720 
there somewhere he keeps knocking that
over<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.620> I'm<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.950> nervous<00:02:12.129> about<00:02:12.400> how<00:02:12.700> I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
over I I'm really nervous about how I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.530 
over I I'm really nervous about how I
fix<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.239> up<00:02:13.499> because<00:02:14.579> he<00:02:15.579> can<00:02:15.819> get<00:02:15.999> behind<00:02:16.180> it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
fix it up because he can get behind it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.100 
fix it up because he can get behind it
and<00:02:16.569> so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
and so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.500 
and so
whatever<00:02:17.380> adhesive<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:18.040> use<00:02:18.370> he's<00:02:19.030> gonna<00:02:19.240> be

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
whatever adhesive I use he's gonna be

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.540 
whatever adhesive I use he's gonna be
able<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.840> come<00:02:20.050> into<00:02:20.200> contact<00:02:20.680> with<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.100> I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
able to come into contact with it and I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.010 
able to come into contact with it and I
would<00:02:21.640> rather<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.060> something<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.630> mild

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
would rather you something really mild

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.600 
would rather you something really mild
that<00:02:23.290> doesn't<00:02:23.590> work<00:02:23.740> very<00:02:23.770> well<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.370> can't

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
that doesn't work very well but can't

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.400 
that doesn't work very well but can't
hurt<00:02:24.850> him<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:25.390> use<00:02:25.540> something<00:02:25.870> super<00:02:26.170> strong

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
hurt him then use something super strong

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.470 
hurt him then use something super strong
and<00:02:26.680> risk<00:02:27.220> him<00:02:27.430> getting<00:02:27.460> stuck<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:28.450> I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
and risk him getting stuck to it so I

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.830 
and risk him getting stuck to it so I
actually<00:02:28.630> just<00:02:28.870> used<00:02:29.140> blue<00:02:29.320> TAC<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.690> you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
actually just used blue TAC but as you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.900 
actually just used blue TAC but as you
can<00:02:32.050> see<00:02:32.260> it's<00:02:32.500> not<00:02:32.710> particularly<00:02:33.460> effective

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
can see it's not particularly effective

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.730 
can see it's not particularly effective
because<00:02:34.300> he<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.660> knocks<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.960> over<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.560> you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
because he just knocks it over but you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.680 
because he just knocks it over but you
know<00:02:35.860> never<00:02:36.100> mind<00:02:36.160> that's<00:02:36.580> not<00:02:36.730> really<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
know never mind that's not really the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.410 
know never mind that's not really the
end<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:37.990> world<00:02:38.730> every<00:02:39.730> morning<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.090> come<00:02:40.120> in

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
end of the world every morning I come in

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.510 
end of the world every morning I come in
and<00:02:40.570> stand<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.900> up<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.350> about<00:02:42.190> two<00:02:42.400> minutes

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
and stand it up and about two minutes

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.310 
and stand it up and about two minutes
later<00:02:42.760> he<00:02:43.060> knocks<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.330> over<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.900> figure<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
later he knocks it over so I figure I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.949 
later he knocks it over so I figure I
might<00:02:44.470> as<00:02:44.530> well<00:02:44.709> just<00:02:44.860> leave<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.160> knocked<00:02:45.340> over

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
might as well just leave it knocked over

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.030 
might as well just leave it knocked over
and<00:02:46.959> he's<00:02:47.050> done<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.320> same<00:02:47.350> down<00:02:47.709> here<00:02:47.740> with

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
and he's done the same down here with

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.240 
and he's done the same down here with
these<00:02:48.130> bits<00:02:48.400> look<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:49.330> see<00:02:49.950> again<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> would

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
these bits look you see again I would

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.010 
these bits look you see again I would
stick<00:02:51.490> them<00:02:51.640> back<00:02:51.790> up<00:02:52.060> but<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.570> be<00:02:52.660> honest<00:02:52.900> he

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
stick them back up but to be honest he

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.300 
stick them back up but to be honest he
just<00:02:53.200> knocked<00:02:53.380> some<00:02:53.500> straight<00:02:53.709> back<00:02:53.860> over<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
just knocked some straight back over and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.370 
just knocked some straight back over and
it<00:02:54.430> doesn't<00:02:54.459> really<00:02:55.030> matter<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.080> gives<00:02:56.290> him

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
it doesn't really matter it gives him

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.600 
it doesn't really matter it gives him
somewhere<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.739> hide<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:59.250> you<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> don't

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
somewhere to hide and you know I don't

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.790 
somewhere to hide and you know I don't
mind<00:03:00.790> too<00:03:01.000> much<00:03:01.030> if<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.780> find<00:03:02.050> out<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> good<00:03:02.590> way

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
mind too much if I find out a good way

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.620 
mind too much if I find out a good way
of<00:03:02.980> attaching<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.550> polystyrene<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.480> back

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
of attaching the polystyrene to the back

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.080 
of attaching the polystyrene to the back
without<00:03:04.989> risking<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:06.010> harming<00:03:06.670> him<00:03:06.820> then<00:03:07.060> I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
without risking it harming him then I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.000 
without risking it harming him then I
might<00:03:07.660> fix<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.290> otherwise<00:03:08.470> I'm<00:03:08.709> not<00:03:08.830> too

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
might fix it but otherwise I'm not too

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.990 
might fix it but otherwise I'm not too
worried<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.930> yeah<00:03:11.020> Aspen<00:03:11.410> does<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.070> themed<00:03:12.340> so

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
worried so yeah Aspen does it themed so

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.220 
worried so yeah Aspen does it themed so
it<00:03:13.150> looks<00:03:13.360> quite<00:03:13.540> good<00:03:13.570> for<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.110> other

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
it looks quite good for that the other

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.380 
it looks quite good for that the other
reason<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:15.340> fact<00:03:15.520> there's<00:03:15.700> two<00:03:15.820> other<00:03:16.000> reasons

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
reason in fact there's two other reasons

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.330 
reason in fact there's two other reasons
one<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.959> it's<00:03:17.110> really<00:03:17.440> useful<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.070> being

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
one is that it's really useful for being

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.370 
one is that it's really useful for being
absorbent<00:03:18.910> when<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.660> animal<00:03:19.930> defecates

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
absorbent when the animal defecates

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.039 
absorbent when the animal defecates
which<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.860> course<00:03:21.070> he<00:03:21.400> does<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.750> other<00:03:22.840> reason

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
which of course he does the other reason

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.440 
which of course he does the other reason
is<00:03:23.320> that<00:03:23.380> these<00:03:23.890> snakes<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.430> burrowing<00:03:25.030> snakes

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
is that these snakes of burrowing snakes

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.050 
is that these snakes of burrowing snakes
which<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.860> why<00:03:27.220> he's<00:03:27.400> got<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.820> little

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
which is why he's got that little

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.090 
which is why he's got that little
upturned<00:03:28.450> nose<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.019> can<00:03:29.320> see<00:03:29.560> there<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.800 

the<00:03:33.100> good<00:03:33.250> thing<00:03:33.400> about<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.269> Aspen<00:03:34.660> is

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the good thing about the the Aspen is

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.810 
the good thing about the the Aspen is
that<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.080> it's<00:03:35.380> structurally<00:03:36.160> sound<00:03:36.519> enough

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
that it's it's structurally sound enough

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.720 
that it's it's structurally sound enough
to<00:03:37.720> keep<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.110> for<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:38.860> tunnels<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.430> remain

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
to keep it for the tunnels to remain

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.280 
to keep it for the tunnels to remain
once<00:03:40.239> he's<00:03:40.420> dug<00:03:40.630> them<00:03:40.780> which<00:03:40.930> means<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
once he's dug them which means that you

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.720 
once he's dug them which means that you
can<00:03:41.470> create<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.769> little<00:03:42.040> network<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.549> there

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
can create a little network in there

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.520 
can create a little network in there
which<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.390> quite<00:03:43.600> nice<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.049> it's<00:03:44.260> better<00:03:44.380> than

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
which is quite nice and it's better than

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.620 
which is quite nice and it's better than
any<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.920> sand<00:03:45.160> based<00:03:45.480> substrates<00:03:46.480> that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
any of the sand based substrates that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.830 
any of the sand based substrates that
just<00:03:46.810> fall<00:03:47.019> through<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.390> mentioned<00:03:49.630> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
just fall through so I mentioned that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.170 
just fall through so I mentioned that
it's<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.170> 30<00:03:50.410> degree<00:03:50.620> hot<00:03:51.070> spot<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.580> that<00:03:51.610> he

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
it's a 30 degree hot spot and that he

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.060 
it's a 30 degree hot spot and that he
has<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.810> rest<00:03:52.959> of<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> tank<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.560> he<00:03:53.709> can<00:03:53.920> go

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
has the rest of the tank that he can go

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.440 
has the rest of the tank that he can go
and<00:03:54.250> escape<00:03:54.430> in<00:03:54.760> if<00:03:54.880> he<00:03:54.970> wants<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.209> get<00:03:55.360> away

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
and escape in if he wants to get away

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.479 
and escape in if he wants to get away
from<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.870> which<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.590> think's<00:03:56.830> really<00:03:56.950> important

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
from it which I think's really important

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.729 
from it which I think's really important
as<00:03:57.610> I've<00:03:57.730> said<00:03:57.910> before<00:03:58.350> he's<00:03:59.350> got<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.530> water

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
as I've said before he's got a water

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.410 
as I've said before he's got a water
dish<00:04:00.040> up<00:04:00.489> there<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:02.709> plant<00:04:03.100> there<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.880> use

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
dish up there and that plant there I use

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.630 
dish up there and that plant there I use
as<00:04:04.750> his<00:04:05.140> feeding<00:04:05.440> station<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.160> when<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.340> feed

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
as his feeding station so when I feed

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.250 
as his feeding station so when I feed
him<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.880> dropped<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.330> mouse<00:04:07.810> on<00:04:07.989> top<00:04:08.110> of

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
him I dropped the the mouse on top of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.320 
him I dropped the the mouse on top of
that<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.860> then<00:04:09.430> he<00:04:09.640> knows<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:09.940> that's<00:04:10.120> very

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
that and then he knows that that's very

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.520 
that and then he knows that that's very
nice<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.660> come<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.930> have<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.049> look<00:04:11.200> for<00:04:11.410> his

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
nice to come and have a look for his

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.910 
nice to come and have a look for his
food<00:04:11.860> oh<00:04:12.100> hello<00:04:13.650> hi<00:04:16.890> now

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
food oh hello hi now

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.070 
food oh hello hi now
about<00:04:19.520> a<00:04:19.550> minute<00:04:19.940> before<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.330> started<00:04:20.840> filming

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
about a minute before I started filming

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.400 
about a minute before I started filming
he<00:04:21.500> was<00:04:21.650> slithering<00:04:22.610> everywhere<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:24.110> he<00:04:24.230> was

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
he was slithering everywhere and he was

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.770 
he was slithering everywhere and he was
giving<00:04:24.710> lots<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.550> activity<00:04:26.120> moving<00:04:26.390> around

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
giving lots of activity moving around

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.260 
giving lots of activity moving around
all<00:04:27.560> sorts<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:28.070> get<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.280> camera<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.940> he<00:04:29.030> sits

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
all sorts I get the camera and he sits

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.660 
all sorts I get the camera and he sits
still<00:04:29.480> naturally<00:04:30.290> but<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.160> suppose<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.550> makes

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
still naturally but I suppose it makes

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.950 
still naturally but I suppose it makes
it<00:04:31.820> easier<00:04:32.060> for<00:04:32.210> me<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.300> film<00:04:32.600> him<00:04:32.720> but<00:04:32.870> he's

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
it easier for me to film him but he's

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.880 
it easier for me to film him but he's
not<00:04:33.050> doing<00:04:33.200> anything<00:04:33.440> particularly

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
not doing anything particularly

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.170 
not doing anything particularly

one<00:05:17.120> thing<00:05:17.390> that<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.660> important<00:05:18.260> to

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
one thing that it is important to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.730 
one thing that it is important to
remember<00:05:19.310> with<00:05:19.610> these<00:05:19.790> snakes<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:20.740> they

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
remember with these snakes is that they

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.350 
remember with these snakes is that they
naturally<00:05:22.300> go<00:05:23.300> off<00:05:23.570> feed<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:25.820> for<00:05:25.940> about<00:05:26.090> six

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
naturally go off feed so for about six

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.260 
naturally go off feed so for about six
months<00:05:26.480> of<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.810> year<00:05:27.550> maybe<00:05:28.550> four<00:05:28.910> months<00:05:29.030> of

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
months of the year maybe four months of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.740 
months of the year maybe four months of
the<00:05:29.360> year

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
the year

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.960 
the year
they<00:05:30.290> just<00:05:30.470> won't<00:05:30.620> eat<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:31.130> there's<00:05:31.640> nothing

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
they just won't eat and there's nothing

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.100 
they just won't eat and there's nothing
wrong<00:05:32.060> with<00:05:32.210> that<00:05:32.300> it's<00:05:32.540> just<00:05:32.750> part<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:32.990> their

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
wrong with that it's just part of their

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.560 
wrong with that it's just part of their
behavior<00:05:33.640> they<00:05:34.640> lose<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.910> fair<00:05:35.210> bit<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.420> weight

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
behavior they lose a fair bit of weight

he's<00:05:38.570> he<00:05:39.140> is<00:05:39.260> feeding<00:05:39.560> but<00:05:39.920> he's<00:05:40.130> not<00:05:40.310> as<00:05:40.460> thick

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
he's he is feeding but he's not as thick

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.300 
he's he is feeding but he's not as thick
as<00:05:41.180> he<00:05:41.270> could<00:05:41.450> be<00:05:41.600> but<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.680> know<00:05:42.710> it's<00:05:42.950> just<00:05:43.040> he

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
as he could be but you know it's just he

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.590 
as he could be but you know it's just he
does<00:05:43.460> it<00:05:43.580> every<00:05:43.850> year<00:05:44.090> it's<00:05:44.330> just<00:05:44.420> a

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
does it every year it's just a

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.040 
does it every year it's just a
completely<00:05:45.110> natural<00:05:45.260> part<00:05:45.770> of<00:05:45.920> how<00:05:46.130> they<00:05:46.310> live

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
completely natural part of how they live

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
completely natural part of how they live
so<00:05:48.050> if<00:05:48.170> you've<00:05:48.290> got<00:05:48.440> one<00:05:48.500> of<00:05:48.620> these<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:48.980> he's

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
so if you've got one of these and he's

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.410 
so if you've got one of these and he's
not<00:05:49.280> feeding<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.730> he<00:05:49.790> hasn't<00:05:49.970> fed<00:05:50.240> for<00:05:50.390> a

little<00:05:50.630> while<00:05:50.780> don't<00:05:51.020> worry<00:05:51.730> just<00:05:52.730> be<00:05:52.880> patient

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
little while don't worry just be patient

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.000 
little while don't worry just be patient
they<00:05:53.420> will<00:05:53.570> feed<00:05:53.810> again<00:05:53.930> it's<00:05:54.410> just<00:05:54.680> part<00:05:54.890> of

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
they will feed again it's just part of

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.310 
they will feed again it's just part of
their<00:05:55.220> part<00:05:56.150> of<00:05:56.270> their<00:05:56.360> natural<00:05:56.690> behavior<00:05:57.080> so

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.390 
trying with something small if he takes
it<00:06:03.050> great<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.650> can<00:06:03.800> start<00:06:04.010> feeding<00:06:04.190> them

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
it great you can start feeding them

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.250 
it great you can start feeding them
bigger<00:06:04.550> things<00:06:04.790> again<00:06:05.060> if<00:06:05.720> he<00:06:05.870> doesn't<00:06:06.140> take
