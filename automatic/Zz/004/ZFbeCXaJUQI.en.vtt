00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.120
Hello, welcome to CasekingTV. Today with a brandnew case 
 from Akasa, which is not yet released.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.880
Upcoming and right away available at Caskeing.de of course.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.280
The Akasa Venom Toxic relates to the existing Akasa CPU Series.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.640
The colour scheme, black and yellow as well as the name are related.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.720
What does this case offer you ? Let´s start with the front panel.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.960
It is placed up in the front of the top panel.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.080
We have the power button and two fan controls on the sides.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:05.280
Each is for 3 fans and all 6 
 fans may use up to 40 watts.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:18.520
Easy to control via front panel. You have eSata, 
 USB3.0, audio jacks and three USB2.0 connectors.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.320
On the right side you find the Venom logo.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:39.080
Nice extra, most companies skip that, because it´s costing money.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:52.500
A clean mesh front with a lot of slots and behind 
 the front we will see a fan and HDD cage.

00:01:52.501 --> 00:02:06.960
Let´s turn the case and have a look inside.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.160
The inside offers a lot of space. Up 
 to XL ATX mainboards can be fitted.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.520
A lot of space as you can see. A hole 
 for the CPU backplate can be found up here.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:35.840
10 PCI slots with a fast lock system for easy access.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.040
In the back a 14 cm fan is built in. Another fast 
 lock system can also be found on the 5,25" slots.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:03:00.200
Alo easy access HDD slots. In the bottom anti 
 vibration rubber fitted holes for 2,5" drives.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.960
So really all 3,5" slots can also be used for 2,5" drives.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:14.160
In the front a 23 cm LED fan, in 
 the top panel the same without LED.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:26.520
The top fan can be exchanged with two 120 or 140 
 mm fans and a 240 mm radiator fits right away.

00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:36.440
In the back four holes for watercooling or cables.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.200
In the bottom we find air vent holes below the 
 power supply and right in front of it.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.720
Fitted with exchangeable dust filters.

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:58.760
Last exciting feature is the amount of openings for cable management.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:10.640
A lot of options to hide your cables 
 behind the mainboard tray or other components.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.720
Akasa Venom Toxic will be released soon and available at Caseking.de

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:29.320
I hope you got a first good impression. See you next time.
