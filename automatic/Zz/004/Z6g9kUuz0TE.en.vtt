little bit of the oil leak and what it
does<00:01:02.090> come<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.239> me<00:01:03.449> under<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.409> car<00:01:05.030> right

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
does come with me under the car right

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.490 
does come with me under the car right
there<00:01:06.270> we'll<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> second<00:01:08.390> okay

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
there we'll be there in a second okay

there we'll be there in a second okay
under<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.740> car<00:01:11.869> probably<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> got<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
s600 then is so a leak that comes from

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640 
s600 then is so a leak that comes from
the<00:01:16.979> backside<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> motor<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the backside of the motor you have the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.219 
the backside of the motor you have the
problem<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.159> everybody<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.119> talking<00:01:21.960> about

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
problem that everybody is talking about

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.780 
problem that everybody is talking about
that<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.549> oil<00:01:23.580> core<00:01:25.640> before<00:01:26.640> I'm

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that that's the oil core before I'm

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.670 
that that's the oil core before I'm
going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> start<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.229> probably<00:01:28.470> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the heads off and go crazy on this motor

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330 
the heads off and go crazy on this motor
and<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> apart<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:46.290> gonna<00:01:46.500> try<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> get

and take it apart I'm gonna try and get

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
and take it apart I'm gonna try and get
to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> point<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.630> exactly

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to the point that I can see exactly

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
to the point that I can see exactly
pinpoint<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.520> where<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.909> oil<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> leaking

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
pinpoint to where the oil is leaking

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.560 
pinpoint to where the oil is leaking
from<00:01:51.740> right<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:52.920> work<00:01:53.130> under<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> car<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.450> get

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
from right now work under the car to get

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.590 
from right now work under the car to get
a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.840> closer<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
a little closer you can see this is the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.910 
a little closer you can see this is the
section<00:01:57.899> where<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.100> oil

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
section where you see all the oil

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.109 
section where you see all the oil
leaking<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.130> everywhere<00:02:02.850> basically

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
leaking from everywhere basically

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.440 
leaking from everywhere basically
clicking<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.079> one<00:02:04.320> place<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.579> while

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
clicking from one place but just while

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.650 
clicking from one place but just while
you're<00:02:06.600> driving<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.890> spreads<00:02:08.280> everywhere

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.070 

as<00:02:10.900> you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.170> see<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.570> does<00:02:13.600> and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
as you can see here is what it does and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.210 
as you can see here is what it does and
the<00:02:14.980> person<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.550> got<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.910> car<00:02:16.270> from<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:17.220> assumed

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the person I got this car from I assumed

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.470 
the person I got this car from I assumed
that<00:02:18.310> they've<00:02:18.490> been<00:02:18.670> driving<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.270> long

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that they've been driving for a long

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.330 
that they've been driving for a long
time<00:02:19.720> like<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.350> just<00:02:20.380> kept<00:02:20.770> on<00:02:20.920> filling

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
time like that and just kept on filling

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.570 
time like that and just kept on filling
oil<00:02:21.600> which<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.750> shouldn't<00:02:23.080> do<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:24.310> you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
oil which you shouldn't do that if you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.540 
oil which you shouldn't do that if you

you can see the old was licking over the
muffler<00:02:38.740> kentley<00:02:39.430> converters<00:02:43.050> system<00:02:44.050> this

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
muffler kentley converters system this

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.240 
muffler kentley converters system this
is<00:02:44.920> getting<00:02:45.250> really<00:02:45.700> hot<00:02:45.990> when<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.140> works<00:02:47.410> all

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
is getting really hot when it works all

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.760 
is getting really hot when it works all
these<00:02:48.460> sections<00:02:48.940> are<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.720> really<00:02:50.020> hot<00:02:50.200> so

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
these sections are really really hot so

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.620 
these sections are really really hot so
when<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.070> get<00:02:51.190> Toyland<00:02:51.760> then<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> oil<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.600> I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
when you get Toyland then the oil can I

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.300 
when you get Toyland then the oil can I
get<00:02:52.960> them<00:02:53.110> catch<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.530> fire<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.890> basically

sitting inside so you start to get the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.060 
sitting inside so you start to get the
oil<00:02:58.390> leak<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.900> everything<00:02:59.260> stop<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.830> car

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.700 
section we're here we're gonna get
closer<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.360> motor<00:03:13.570> these<00:03:14.080> are<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:17.680> of

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
closer to the motor these are some of

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.620 
closer to the motor these are some of
the<00:03:17.950> hoses<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.640> carrying<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.420> oil

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the hoses that carrying the oil

circulating around to the cooler make

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.360 
circulating around to the cooler make
sure<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.820> keeps<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.360> cool<00:03:25.710> as<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:27.010> can<00:03:27.160> see

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
sure it keeps it cool as you can see

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.170 
sure it keeps it cool as you can see
everything<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.940> full<00:03:28.270> of<00:03:28.300> oil<00:03:28.660> now<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:31.000> may

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
everything is full of oil now you may

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.500 
everything is full of oil now you may
not<00:03:31.420> see<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.930> immediately<00:03:32.500> there<00:03:32.710> are<00:03:32.770> two<00:03:33.510> -

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
not see that immediately there are two -

not see that immediately there are two -
plastic<00:03:35.170> covers<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:36.040> protecting<00:03:36.960> shield<00:03:37.960> is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
plastic covers the protecting shield is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.620 
plastic covers the protecting shield is
protecting<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.830> motor<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.630> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
protecting the motor and the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.230 
protecting the motor and the
undercarriage<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.920> have<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.520> remove

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
undercarriage that you have to remove

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.550 
undercarriage that you have to remove
first<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:46.180> before<00:03:46.810> you're<00:03:46.990> gonna<00:03:47.080> be<00:03:47.260> able<00:03:47.320> to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
first so before you're gonna be able to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.470 
first so before you're gonna be able to
see<00:03:47.770> what<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.100> see<00:03:48.280> right<00:03:48.550> now<00:03:48.580> here<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.450> have

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
see what you see right now here you have

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.660 
see what you see right now here you have
to<00:03:49.630> take<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.110> plastics<00:03:50.620> off<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.100> think<00:03:51.190> it's<00:03:51.520> a

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
to take the plastics off I think it's a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.440 
to take the plastics off I think it's a
number<00:03:52.000> eight<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.780> number<00:03:53.850> 13<00:03:54.850> for<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.120> two

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
number eight and number 13 for the two

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.270 
number eight and number 13 for the two
front<00:03:55.780> ones<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.260> number<00:03:56.560> eight<00:03:56.740> for<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.100> rest

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
front ones the number eight for the rest

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.680 
front ones the number eight for the rest
of<00:03:57.430> them<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:57.850> two<00:03:58.000> different<00:03:58.120> pieces<00:03:58.420> of

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
of them it's two different pieces of

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.060 
of them it's two different pieces of
plastic<00:04:00.420> as<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.600> can<00:04:01.750> see<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.260> oil<00:04:02.500> got<00:04:02.890> all

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
plastic as you can see the oil got all

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.780 
plastic as you can see the oil got all
the<00:04:03.250> way<00:04:03.400> here<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.750> let's<00:04:05.560> go<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.610> other

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
the way here and let's go to the other

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.940 
the way here and let's go to the other
side<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.690> back<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.200> car<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.680> look<00:04:08.860> at

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
side to the back of the car and look at

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.350 
side to the back of the car and look at
the<00:04:09.010> back<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.430> car<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.730> got<00:04:09.880> all<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.240> way

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
the back of the car you got all the way

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.290 
the back of the car you got all the way
to<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.600> back<00:04:10.780> that's<00:04:11.140> that's<00:04:11.740> Hazzard<00:04:12.340> that's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
to the back that's that's Hazzard that's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.300 
to the back that's that's Hazzard that's
really<00:04:13.810> really<00:04:14.050> dangerous<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.770> guy<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:14.950> don't

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
really really dangerous the guy I don't

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.860 
really really dangerous the guy I don't
think<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.670> understand<00:04:16.120> how<00:04:16.180> dangerous<00:04:16.390> and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
think you understand how dangerous and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.020 
think you understand how dangerous and
how<00:04:16.930> lucky<00:04:17.170> was<00:04:17.500> didn't<00:04:17.859> even<00:04:17.980> catch<00:04:18.190> on<00:04:18.370> fire

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
how lucky was didn't even catch on fire

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.990 
how lucky was didn't even catch on fire
but<00:04:19.750> when<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.139> gets<00:04:20.380> hot<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:21.220> can<00:04:21.459> definitely

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
but when it gets hot it can definitely

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.730 
but when it gets hot it can definitely
catch<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.330> fire<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:22.900> as<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.170> said<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.530> is<00:04:23.590> the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
catch on fire so as I said this is the

the oil cooler which is located under
the<00:04:48.100> motor<00:04:48.400> on<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:48.820> section<00:04:49.060> on<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> back<00:04:49.480> of

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
the motor on that section on the back of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.990 
the motor on that section on the back of
the<00:04:49.660> motor<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.340> take<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.730> valve

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
the motor you have to take the valve

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.670 
the motor you have to take the valve
covers<00:04:52.390> out<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:52.900> then<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.140> have<00:04:53.230> to<00:04:53.350> take<00:04:53.530> the

before I'm going to diagnose the problem

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.270 
before I'm going to diagnose the problem
first<00:05:01.990> I'm<00:05:02.230> going<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.530> make<00:05:02.710> sure<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:02.980> I<00:05:03.100> can

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
first I'm going to make sure that I can

everything in the oil leaks faster and
faster<00:05:31.360> over<00:05:31.810> at<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:31.990> time<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:35.020> motor<00:05:35.229> here<00:05:35.650> I

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
faster over at a time the motor here I

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.190 
faster over at a time the motor here I
already<00:05:36.190> took<00:05:36.370> some<00:05:36.729> of<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.030> covers<00:05:37.419> from<00:05:38.110> the

already took some of the covers from the

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.800 
already took some of the covers from the
top<00:05:38.530> of<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.830> motor<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.850> airbox<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.450> from<00:05:40.660> the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
top of the motor the airbox is from the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.310 
top of the motor the airbox is from the
side<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.789> I<00:05:42.789> already<00:05:43.240> started<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.110> try<00:05:44.289> and

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
side so I already started to try and

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.469 
side so I already started to try and
find<00:05:44.620> out<00:05:44.830> where<00:05:44.979> the<00:05:45.100> oil<00:05:45.280> is<00:05:45.370> coming<00:05:45.400> from<00:05:45.789> so
