gotten<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.119> happen<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.570> wearing<00:01:45.780> these

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
gotten I happen to be wearing these

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
gotten I happen to be wearing these
gloves<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.380> these<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.680> definitely<00:01:46.860> some<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
gloves so these are definitely some of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
gloves so these are definitely some of
my<00:01:47.310> favorite<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.750> wearing<00:01:48.960> during<00:01:49.229> away

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
my favorite and I wearing during away

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
my favorite and I wearing during away
game<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.040> their<00:01:50.159> home<00:01:50.369> games<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
game some was their home games but I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.569 
game some was their home games but I
really<00:01:51.750> wanted<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.110> pair<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> solid<00:01:53.340> blue

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
really wanted a pair of solid blue

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.780 
really wanted a pair of solid blue
gloves<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> didn't<00:01:56.640> have

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
gloves and you know that I didn't have

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
gloves and you know that I didn't have
one<00:01:57.000> from<00:01:57.180> Nike<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> things<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
one from Nike so one of the things I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.429 
one from Nike so one of the things I
think<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.310> best<00:01:59.610> move<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.880> cutters<00:02:00.420> did<00:02:00.689> was

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
think a best move that cutters did was

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
think a best move that cutters did was
come<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> x40<00:02:02.369> salad<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> my

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
come up with the x40 salad so some of my

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
come up with the x40 salad so some of my
friends<00:02:04.110> were<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.799> pair<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> all<00:02:05.520> met

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
friends were in all a pair of all met

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.119 
friends were in all a pair of all met
and<00:02:06.020> they<00:02:07.020> were<00:02:07.140> too<00:02:07.290> raw<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and they were too raw so I was like I

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919 
and they were too raw so I was like I
looked<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.640> website<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.209> saw<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.569> blue<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
looked on the website I saw all blue and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.660 
looked on the website I saw all blue and
I<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.679> these<00:02:11.459> look

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
I was like you know what these look

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.250 
I was like you know what these look
pretty<00:02:11.790> good<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.599> some<00:02:12.810> pros<00:02:13.020> wear

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
pretty good so you see some pros wear

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
pretty good so you see some pros wear
them

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
them

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.950 
them
and<00:02:14.280> autumn<00:02:15.120> cause<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> think<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:15.750> look

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and autumn cause and I think they look

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.620 
and autumn cause and I think they look
really<00:02:16.200> good<00:02:16.520> much<00:02:17.520> better<00:02:17.550> than<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.450> other

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
really good much better than the other

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.390 
really good much better than the other
cutters<00:02:19.050> designs<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.680> don't<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.070> solid

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
cutters designs that don't have solid

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
cutters designs that don't have solid
colors<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.880> was<00:02:20.970> my<00:02:21.060> problem<00:02:21.330> mainly<00:02:22.080> cars

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
colors that was my problem mainly cars

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.200 
colors that was my problem mainly cars
is<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.830> when<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.490> look<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.850> glove<00:02:24.090> like

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
is that when we look at a glove like

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.080 
is that when we look at a glove like
Nike<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.840> design<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.400> Nike<00:02:26.640> designs<00:02:26.910> are

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
Nike the design the Nike designs are

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.410 
Nike the design the Nike designs are
just<00:02:27.240> better<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.980> general<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:30.240> don't

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
just better in general but they don't

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.450 
just better in general but they don't
make<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> solid<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.500> Kassala<00:02:31.920> color<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
make a solid so the Kassala color is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.770 
make a solid so the Kassala color is
something<00:02:32.640> they're<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.240> stands<00:02:33.570> out

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
something they're like really stands out

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.270 
something they're like really stands out
from<00:02:33.990> any<00:02:34.320> other<00:02:34.590> glove<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.040> field

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
from any other glove on the field

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.430 
from any other glove on the field
besides<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.150> course<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:37.050> know<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.230> guys

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
besides of course you know you guys

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.590 
besides of course you know you guys
think<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.770> grip<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.240> what<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.480> came

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
think the grip so this is what it came

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.300 
think the grip so this is what it came
with<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.170> might<00:02:40.320> have<00:02:40.470> seen<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
with you might have seen it in the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.930 
with you might have seen it in the
unboxing<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.260> cutters<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.920> gloves<00:02:44.190> became

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
unboxing but cutters the gloves became

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.990 
unboxing but cutters the gloves became
with<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.870> tells<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.000> basically

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
with this and it tells you the basically

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.700 
with this and it tells you the basically
the<00:02:48.150> amount<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.420> grip<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> cutters<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.590> in

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
the amount of grip so the cutters is in

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.800 
the amount of grip so the cutters is in
green<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.220> says<00:02:50.430> has<00:02:50.610> made<00:02:50.910> way<00:02:51.360> more<00:02:51.390> grip

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
green it says has made way more grip

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.230 
green it says has made way more grip
than<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.110> paper<00:02:52.260> Jets<00:02:52.620> what<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.150> what

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
than the paper Jets what I have and what

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.220 
than the paper Jets what I have and what
I'm<00:02:54.360> going<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.540> compare<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.110> actually

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
I'm going to compare it to is actually

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.330 
I'm going to compare it to is actually
the<00:02:56.270> favorite<00:02:57.270> jet<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.570> carbon<00:02:57.870> paper<00:02:57.990> Jets

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the favorite jet the carbon paper Jets

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.250 
the favorite jet the carbon paper Jets
or<00:02:59.340> vapor<00:02:59.640> carbons<00:03:00.150> which<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.810> more<00:03:01.050> grit

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
or vapor carbons which have more grit

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.410 
or vapor carbons which have more grit
they<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.470> super<00:03:01.740> grip<00:03:02.000> versus<00:03:03.000> they<00:03:03.360> were

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
they have super grip versus they were

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.820 
they have super grip versus they were
just<00:03:03.750> Vandergriff<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.380> don't<00:03:04.650> know<00:03:04.709> what

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
just Vandergriff so I don't know what

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.910 
just Vandergriff so I don't know what
the<00:03:04.920> coefficient<00:03:05.550> friction<00:03:05.790> rating<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.920> but

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
the coefficient friction rating is but

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.620 
the coefficient friction rating is but
you<00:03:08.130> know<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.459> add<00:03:08.580> real-world<00:03:09.090> tests<00:03:09.390> so

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you know I just add real-world tests so

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.570 
you know I just add real-world tests so
we'll<00:03:10.050> see<00:03:10.200> how<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.470> performed<00:03:11.010> wet<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.459> dry

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
we'll see how it performed wet and dry

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.480 
we'll see how it performed wet and dry
and<00:03:11.700> everything<00:03:11.970> else<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.800> basically<00:03:14.160> first

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
and everything else so basically first

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.790 
and everything else so basically first
let's<00:03:14.850> talk<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.330> fit<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.530> know<00:03:16.650> they

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
let's talk about the fit you know they

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.390 
let's talk about the fit you know they
fit<00:03:17.040> very<00:03:17.310> well<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:19.560> know<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.709> lot<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:20.130> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
fit very well you know a lot like the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.870 
fit very well you know a lot like the
paper<00:03:20.790> carbons<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:22.230> an<00:03:22.440> easy<00:03:22.680> fit<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
paper carbons so it's an easy fit the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.550 
paper carbons so it's an easy fit the
one<00:03:24.060> thing<00:03:24.180> they<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.570> they<00:03:24.690> flex<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.350> bit

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
one thing they do is they flex a bit

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.860 
one thing they do is they flex a bit
more<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:27.330> know<00:03:27.360> then<00:03:27.660> like<00:03:27.930> my<00:03:28.400> carbons

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
more you know then like my carbons

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.210 
more you know then like my carbons
that's<00:03:30.870> one<00:03:31.110> thing<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> quality<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
that's one thing is the quality of the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.370 
that's one thing is the quality of the
leather<00:03:32.430> at<00:03:33.360> least<00:03:33.600> seven<00:03:33.840> carbons<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
leather at least seven carbons is a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.330 
leather at least seven carbons is a
really<00:03:35.190> poor<00:03:35.760> synthetic<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.980> know<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.130> have

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
really poor synthetic you know I have

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.590 
really poor synthetic you know I have
another<00:03:38.580> glove<00:03:38.790> review<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.180> ease<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.510> I'll

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
another glove review this ease and I'll

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840 
another glove review this ease and I'll
show<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.620> old<00:03:40.830> Nike<00:03:41.250> leather

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
show you what the old Nike leather

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.520 
show you what the old Nike leather
gloves<00:03:42.090> used<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.330> be<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.570> but<00:03:42.780> there's<00:03:43.380> more

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
gloves used to be like but there's more

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.080 
gloves used to be like but there's more
flex<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.280> probably<00:03:44.370> due<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.910> mesh

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
flex here it's probably due to this mesh

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.000 
flex here it's probably due to this mesh
panel<00:03:45.120> here<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.870> allows<00:03:46.110> your<00:03:46.350> hand<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.739> flex

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
panel here it allows your hand to flex

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.490 
panel here it allows your hand to flex
more<00:03:47.310> over<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> knuckle<00:03:48.450> whereas<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.470> know

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
more over the knuckle whereas you know

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.960 
more over the knuckle whereas you know
you're<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.800> little<00:03:49.890> bit<00:03:50.010> restricted<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:50.850> your

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
you're a little bit restricted so your

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.960 
you're a little bit restricted so your
hand<00:03:51.180> doesn't<00:03:51.510> flex<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:52.160> easy<00:03:53.160> as<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.820> over

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
hand doesn't flex as easy as it is over

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.360 
hand doesn't flex as easy as it is over
here<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:55.080> there's<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.860> couple<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.160> things<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
here so there's a couple of things that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.670 
here so there's a couple of things that
make<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.790> glove<00:03:57.120> great<00:03:57.390> right<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:58.410> course

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
make a glove great right of course

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
gonna have the design and then you're

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.690 
gonna have the design and then you're
also<00:04:06.930> gonna<00:04:07.110> have<00:04:07.200> what<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:08.040> called<00:04:08.310> ball

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
also gonna have what is called ball

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.789 
also gonna have what is called ball
field<00:04:09.060> it's<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.290> through<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
field it's just you know through the

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.310 
field it's just you know through the
glove<00:04:11.070> how<00:04:11.430> well<00:04:11.700> can<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.060> actually<00:04:12.269> feel<00:04:12.720> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
glove how well can you actually feel the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.690 
glove how well can you actually feel the
football<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.890> feel<00:04:14.070> like<00:04:14.220> you're<00:04:14.400> wearing<00:04:14.489> a

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
football and feel like you're wearing a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.789 
football and feel like you're wearing a
glove<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.959> think<00:04:16.109> about<00:04:16.200> ball<00:04:16.470> fields

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
glove so if you think about ball fields

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.370 
glove so if you think about ball fields
like<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.160> difference<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.609> wearing<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.720> winter

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
like the difference of wearing a winter

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.690 
like the difference of wearing a winter
glove<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:19.950> football<00:04:20.130> glove<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.609> you

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
glove and a football glove like you

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.099 
glove and a football glove like you
really<00:04:20.820> can't<00:04:21.060> feel<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.540> ball<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> winter

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
really can't feel the ball and a winter

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.070 
really can't feel the ball and a winter
glove<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.979> both<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.850> these<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.240> good<00:04:24.870> ball

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
glove so both of these have good ball

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.330 
glove so both of these have good ball
field<00:04:25.440> but<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.800> think<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.280> cutters<00:04:26.640> has<00:04:26.850> better

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
field but I think the cutters has better

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.460 
field but I think the cutters has better
ballfield<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.090> that's<00:04:28.570> going<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.750> make<00:04:28.900> for<00:04:28.960> a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
ballfield and that's going to make for a

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.050 
ballfield and that's going to make for a
little<00:04:29.919> better<00:04:30.070> glove<00:04:30.340> in<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.669> department

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
little better glove in that department

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.600 
little better glove in that department
in<00:04:31.300> terms<00:04:31.389> of<00:04:31.600> all<00:04:31.720> feel<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:33.190> other<00:04:33.370> good

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
in terms of all feel the other good

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.870 
in terms of all feel the other good
thing<00:04:33.820> about<00:04:34.300> cars<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:36.040> fit<00:04:36.280> if<00:04:36.490> it's<00:04:36.669> nice

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
thing about cars is the fit if it's nice

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.879 
thing about cars is the fit if it's nice
if<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.330> tight<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:38.230> doesn't<00:04:38.500> feel<00:04:38.590> like<00:04:38.650> it

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
if it's tight it doesn't feel like it

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.200 
if it's tight it doesn't feel like it
has<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.040> long<00:04:39.280> break-in<00:04:39.639> period

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
has a long break-in period

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.460 
has a long break-in period
you<00:04:40.570> know<00:04:40.660> I've<00:04:40.750> only<00:04:40.840> used<00:04:41.080> them<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.230> couple<00:04:41.410> of

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
you know I've only used them a couple of

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.550 
you know I've only used them a couple of
times<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.190> can't<00:04:42.760> tell<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:44.350> know<00:04:44.440> if

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
times so I can't tell you you know if

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.390 
times so I can't tell you you know if
they're<00:04:44.680> gonna<00:04:44.800> feel<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.040> little<00:04:45.130> bit<00:04:45.250> better

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
they're gonna feel a little bit better

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.700 
they're gonna feel a little bit better
after<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:45.790> wear<00:04:46.000> them<00:04:46.120> for<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.300> little<00:04:46.419> bit<00:04:46.710> and

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
after I wear them for a little bit and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.780 
after I wear them for a little bit and
then<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.950> think<00:04:48.100> if<00:04:48.190> you've<00:04:48.310> seen<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.580> Under

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
then I think if you've seen the Under

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.050 
then I think if you've seen the Under
Armour<00:04:49.030> video<00:04:49.800> like<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.950> warp<00:04:51.160> speeds<00:04:51.460> one

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
Armour video like the warp speeds one

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.870 
Armour video like the warp speeds one
problem<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.389> had<00:04:52.570> is<00:04:52.690> with<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.110> cuff<00:04:53.669> is<00:04:54.669> that

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
problem I had is with the cuff is that

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.909 
problem I had is with the cuff is that
it<00:04:55.000> would<00:04:55.090> just<00:04:55.210> flap<00:04:55.510> around<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.560> these<00:04:56.710> don't

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919

that's<00:06:58.600> gonna<00:06:58.750> be<00:06:58.870> thinner<00:06:59.110> that's<00:06:59.380> gonna<00:06:59.560> you

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
that's gonna be thinner that's gonna you

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.530 
that's gonna be thinner that's gonna you
know<00:07:00.160> have<00:07:00.370> a<00:07:00.430> little<00:07:00.580> better<00:07:00.790> ball<00:07:01.000> field<00:07:01.270> and

know have a little better ball field and

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.050 
know have a little better ball field and
the<00:07:02.500> only<00:07:02.710> thing<00:07:02.889> is<00:07:02.980> it's<00:07:03.130> not<00:07:03.220> as<00:07:03.400> durable<00:07:03.610> so

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
the only thing is it's not as durable so

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.700 
the only thing is it's not as durable so
the<00:07:04.270> thing<00:07:04.419> I<00:07:04.540> do<00:07:04.600> like<00:07:04.840> about<00:07:04.900> cutters<00:07:05.380> is<00:07:05.560> it

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
the thing I do like about cutters is it

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.780 
the thing I do like about cutters is it
so<00:07:05.830> when<00:07:05.980> they<00:07:06.040> talk<00:07:06.190> about<00:07:06.220> washing<00:07:06.700> the

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
so when they talk about washing the

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.520 
so when they talk about washing the
glove<00:07:07.000> are<00:07:07.690> you<00:07:07.780> gonna<00:07:07.930> do<00:07:08.080> is<00:07:08.260> you're<00:07:08.410> gonna

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
glove are you gonna do is you're gonna

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.510 
glove are you gonna do is you're gonna
put<00:07:08.620> them<00:07:08.860> in<00:07:08.919> the<00:07:09.010> washer

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
put them in the washer

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.190 
put them in the washer
I<00:07:09.580> haven't<00:07:10.270> tried<00:07:10.450> wash<00:07:10.660> them<00:07:10.810> yet<00:07:10.990> outside

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.200 
I haven't tried wash them yet outside

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.129 
I haven't tried wash them yet outside
they're<00:07:11.740> not<00:07:11.860> dirty<00:07:12.040> so<00:07:12.630> and<00:07:13.630> that's<00:07:13.960> one

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
they're not dirty so and that's one

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:15.840 
they're not dirty so and that's one
thing<00:07:14.320> that<00:07:14.560> you<00:07:15.040> know<00:07:15.160> Mikey<00:07:15.400> doesn't<00:07:15.580> tell

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
thing that you know Mikey doesn't tell

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.820 
thing that you know Mikey doesn't tell
you<00:07:16.000> I've<00:07:16.210> put<00:07:16.479> these<00:07:16.630> in<00:07:16.840> and<00:07:17.350> I<00:07:17.440> have<00:07:17.590> a<00:07:17.620> lot

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830 
you I've put these in and I have a lot

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.770 
you I've put these in and I have a lot
of<00:07:18.160> grit<00:07:18.310> but<00:07:18.580> you<00:07:19.120> know<00:07:19.240> I<00:07:19.300> wouldn't<00:07:19.570> do<00:07:19.660> that

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
of grit but you know I wouldn't do that

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.050 
of grit but you know I wouldn't do that
too<00:07:19.930> many<00:07:20.110> times<00:07:20.350> so<00:07:20.550> that's<00:07:21.550> definitely<00:07:21.790> a

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
too many times so that's definitely a

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.370 
too many times so that's definitely a
benefit<00:07:22.360> that<00:07:22.540> cutters<00:07:22.930> are<00:07:23.050> going<00:07:23.169> to<00:07:23.260> have

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
benefit that cutters are going to have

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.770 
benefit that cutters are going to have
over<00:07:23.560> Nike<00:07:23.950> so<00:07:24.270> hopefully<00:07:25.270> they<00:07:25.360> answer<00:07:25.660> your

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
over Nike so hopefully they answer your

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.270 
over Nike so hopefully they answer your
questions<00:07:26.169> in<00:07:26.350> terms<00:07:26.500> of<00:07:26.800> our<00:07:26.979> view<00:07:27.130> for

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 
questions in terms of our view for

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.950 
questions in terms of our view for
cutters<00:07:27.520> gloves<00:07:27.760> and<00:07:27.970> what<00:07:28.540> I<00:07:28.570> thought<00:07:28.780> about

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
cutters gloves and what I thought about

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.710 
cutters gloves and what I thought about
it<00:07:29.639> if<00:07:30.639> I<00:07:30.820> compared<00:07:31.180> it<00:07:31.270> to<00:07:31.350> the<00:07:33.150> vapor<00:07:34.150> carbons

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 
it if I compared it to the vapor carbons

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.620 
it if I compared it to the vapor carbons
I<00:07:34.840> would<00:07:34.990> say<00:07:35.110> they're<00:07:35.320> kind<00:07:35.530> of<00:07:35.710> on<00:07:35.860> par

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 
I would say they're kind of on par

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.969 
I would say they're kind of on par
obviously<00:07:37.630> I<00:07:37.660> want<00:07:38.080> over<00:07:38.169> the<00:07:38.350> benefits<00:07:38.500> of

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:38.979 
obviously I want over the benefits of

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:41.879 
obviously I want over the benefits of
the<00:07:39.639> carbons<00:07:40.060> and<00:07:40.180> benefits<00:07:40.600> of<00:07:40.720> cutters<00:07:40.990> the

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:41.889 
the carbons and benefits of cutters the

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:43.740 
the carbons and benefits of cutters the
vapor<00:07:42.130> Jets<00:07:42.520> they're<00:07:43.030> a<00:07:43.060> little<00:07:43.210> bit<00:07:43.419> thinner

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
vapor Jets they're a little bit thinner

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.020 
vapor Jets they're a little bit thinner
so<00:07:44.050> they're<00:07:44.560> gonna<00:07:44.650> have<00:07:44.950> better<00:07:45.250> ball<00:07:45.640> feel

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.030 
so they're gonna have better ball feel

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.250 
so they're gonna have better ball feel
but<00:07:46.810> the<00:07:46.900> grip<00:07:47.140> is<00:07:47.350> not<00:07:47.380> gonna<00:07:47.680> be<00:07:47.890> as<00:07:48.190> sticky

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.260 
but the grip is not gonna be as sticky

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.840 
but the grip is not gonna be as sticky
so<00:07:50.260> they're<00:07:50.530> so<00:07:50.919> there<00:07:51.039> you<00:07:51.160> have<00:07:51.190> it<00:07:51.430> so<00:07:51.610> if

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.850 
so they're so there you have it so if

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.640 
so they're so there you have it so if
