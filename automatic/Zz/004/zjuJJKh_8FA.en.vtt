00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.810
 from street fighter tekken 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.500

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.630
 do live so you can see everything that 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.250
 there is no cheating or cardboard effects 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.340

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.120

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 139 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.090

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.000
 with also proof that he was not 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.300
 dominated the veil of the hours and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.250
 minutes I say why 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.090
 I have seen many competitions take for 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.030
 youtube where people always say 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.340
 raffle draw raffles that like 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.940

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 direct and things like that then good I 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.490
 I just put a lot of emphasis on this topic 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.720
 and there were the interactions 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.330

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.330

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.190
