now we're going to troubleshoot some

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.619 
now we're going to troubleshoot some
things<00:00:02.340> you<00:00:02.429> may<00:00:02.580> run<00:00:02.700> into<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.210> setting<00:00:03.510> the

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
things you may run into and setting the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.499 
things you may run into and setting the
pitch<00:00:03.920> right<00:00:04.920> now<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.549> pitch<00:00:06.000> check

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
pitch right now this is the pitch check

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.480 
pitch right now this is the pitch check
mode<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.049> fast<00:00:07.379> flashing<00:00:07.830> green<00:00:08.189> so

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
mode with the fast flashing green so

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.980 
mode with the fast flashing green so
we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> check<00:00:09.030> if<00:00:09.240> our<00:00:09.330> pitch<00:00:09.599> curves

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
we're going to check if our pitch curves

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.020 
we're going to check if our pitch curves
and<00:00:10.260> limits<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.740> our<00:00:10.830> radio<00:00:11.130> or<00:00:11.340> set<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.880> what

and limits in our radio or set to what

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.550 
and limits in our radio or set to what
the<00:00:12.120> TG<00:00:12.420> multi<00:00:12.780> wants<00:00:13.639> now<00:00:15.049> one<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.410> way

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
the TG multi wants now one that one way

first thing you want to do you want to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.359 
first thing you want to do you want to
check<00:00:18.210> your<00:00:18.359> maximum<00:00:18.900> limits<00:00:19.289> which<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> your

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
check your maximum limits which is your

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.970 
check your maximum limits which is your
LED<00:00:20.760> three<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.240> led<00:00:21.570> seven<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.619> want<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
LED three and led seven so want to go to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.429 
LED three and led seven so want to go to
stunt<00:00:23.250> mode<00:00:23.580> your<00:00:24.029> LED<00:00:24.449> three<00:00:24.810> should<00:00:25.080> come<00:00:25.260> on

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
stunt mode your LED three should come on

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.370 
stunt mode your LED three should come on
indicating<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.070> at<00:00:26.250> full<00:00:26.519> low<00:00:26.820> limit<00:00:27.380> it's

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
indicating I'm at full low limit it's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.800 
indicating I'm at full low limit it's
not<00:00:28.529> coming<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.810> there's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
not coming on right now so there's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
not coming on right now so there's
multiple<00:00:30.929> things<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> could<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.679> wrong<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
multiple things that could be wrong the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.620 
multiple things that could be wrong the
channel<00:00:32.520> could<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.790> reversed<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> was

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
channel could be reversed if it was

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.229 
channel could be reversed if it was
reversed<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.950> LED<00:00:35.340> seven<00:00:35.730> should<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.969> coming

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
reversed the LED seven should be coming

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
reversed the LED seven should be coming
on<00:00:36.360> indicating<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.930> thinks<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.380> full

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
on indicating and thinks I'm at full

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
on indicating and thinks I'm at full
high<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.250> I'm<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> full<00:00:38.610> low<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.000> isn't<00:00:39.300> so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
high when I'm a full low but it isn't so

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
high when I'm a full low but it isn't so
nothing's<00:00:39.899> coming<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.260> right<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:40.440> which

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
nothing's coming on right now which

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
nothing's coming on right now which
means<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.670> probably<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> problem<00:00:43.230> my

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
means I probably have a problem my

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.010 
means I probably have a problem my
limits<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.850> curves<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
limits I know my curves or from a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010 
limits I know my curves or from a
straight<00:00:46.559> line<00:00:47.000> minus<00:00:48.000> 100<00:00:48.329> plus<00:00:48.480> 100<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.899> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
straight line minus 100 plus 100 so it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.799 
straight line minus 100 plus 100 so it's
not<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:49.410> curves<00:00:49.860> I've<00:00:49.980> already<00:00:50.100> checked<00:00:50.370> that

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
not my curves I've already checked that

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
not my curves I've already checked that
so<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.469> check<00:00:52.680> my<00:00:52.860> end<00:00:53.129> points<00:00:53.550> on

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so I'm do now is check my end points on

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.900 
so I'm do now is check my end points on
my<00:00:53.699> pitch<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> pitch<00:00:57.600> curve<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.640> my<00:00:59.640> pitch

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
my pitch the pitch curve is at my pitch

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
my pitch the pitch curve is at my pitch
is<00:01:00.120> only<00:01:00.359> 110<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> high<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.039> 110<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
is only 110 on the high and 110 on the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.299 
is only 110 on the high and 110 on the
low<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.530> remember<00:01:04.530> correctly<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
low and remember correctly this one

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
low and remember correctly this one
needs<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.909> higher<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.479> eat<00:01:06.689> seat<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
needs to be higher to eat seat I just

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.190 
needs to be higher to eat seat I just
went<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> 125<00:01:08.000> now<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> number<00:01:09.570> three<00:01:09.750> LED

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
went up to 125 now the number three LED

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
went up to 125 now the number three LED
which<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> my<00:01:10.619> low<00:01:10.890> pitch<00:01:11.189> when<00:01:11.880> I'm<00:01:11.970> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
which is my low pitch when I'm in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690 
which is my low pitch when I'm in
trouble<00:01:12.270> hold<00:01:12.680> its<00:01:13.680> rolled<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.250> low<00:01:14.430> pitch

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
trouble hold its rolled my low pitch

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
trouble hold its rolled my low pitch
it's<00:01:15.600> coming<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.470> indicating<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
it's coming on so that's indicating I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
it's coming on so that's indicating I
just<00:01:17.130> didn't<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> endpoint<00:01:18.390> turned<00:01:18.570> up

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
just didn't have the endpoint turned up

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.420 
just didn't have the endpoint turned up
high<00:01:18.869> enough<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> high

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
high enough I'm going to go to high

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.080 
high enough I'm going to go to high
pitch<00:01:21.229> it's<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.350> high<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:23.220> number<00:01:23.520> seven<00:01:23.820> LED

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
pitch it's on high my number seven LED

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
pitch it's on high my number seven LED
she<00:01:24.150> come<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.009> don't

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
she come on but it's not so I also don't

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
she come on but it's not so I also don't
have<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.549> turned<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.880> high<00:01:27.090> enough<00:01:27.650> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
have this turned up high enough it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
have this turned up high enough it
turned<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.369> 117<00:01:30.119> 118<00:01:30.360> I'll<00:01:31.200> go

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
turned out on about 117 118 I'll go

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.749 
turned out on about 117 118 I'll go
ahead<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.560> make<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> same<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> other

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
ahead and make it the same as the other

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
ahead and make it the same as the other
side<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.270> real<00:01:33.630> critical<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.259> will<00:01:35.040> make

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
side it's not real critical I will make

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
side it's not real critical I will make
it<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> same<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> led<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.509> came<00:01:36.750> on

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it the same that that led then came on

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.730 
it the same that that led then came on
now<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.799> i<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.150> normal<00:01:39.540> mode<00:01:39.900> low<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
now if i go to my normal mode low this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.670 
now if i go to my normal mode low this
should<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.159> idol<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:42.090> idol<00:01:42.390> curve<00:01:42.680> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
should be my idol for my idol curve the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
should be my idol for my idol curve the
LED<00:01:44.130> three<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> seven<00:01:44.850> should<00:01:45.210> come<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.600> but

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
LED three and seven should come on but

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
LED three and seven should come on but
they're<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.070> i'm<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> look<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.640> my

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
they're not so i'm going to look at my

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
they're not so i'm going to look at my
pitch<00:01:48.000> curve<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.530> something<00:01:50.040> like

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
pitch curve you have something like

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
pitch curve you have something like
pitch<00:01:50.369> curve<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.939> my<00:01:51.210> low-end<00:01:51.420> i<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.869> set<00:01:52.079> at

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
pitch curve up my low-end i have set at

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.219 
pitch curve up my low-end i have set at
zero<00:01:52.460> instead<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> four<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.990> into<00:01:55.140> my

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
zero instead of the four so i go into my

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.330 
zero instead of the four so i go into my
pitch<00:01:55.530> curve<00:01:56.329> turn<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.450> number<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:58.340> until

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pitch curve turn this number up until

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370 
pitch curve turn this number up until
those<00:01:59.460> leds<00:01:59.880> come<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.329> there's<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> small

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
those leds come on there's a small

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.630 
those leds come on there's a small
there's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:01.799> range<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.369> will<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
there's a little range in here will it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.819 
there's a little range in here will it
wear<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.090> work<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.899> too<00:02:04.079> low<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.530> doesn't

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
wear to work it's too low it doesn't

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.690 
wear to work it's too low it doesn't
come<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.780> it's<00:02:06.780> too<00:02:06.990> high<00:02:07.170> didn't<00:02:07.590> come<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.920> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
come on it's too high didn't come on so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.180 
come on it's too high didn't come on so
you<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:09.420> idol<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.440> flat<00:02:10.739> section

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you your idol which is your flat section

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.990 
you your idol which is your flat section
here<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> curve

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
here the curve

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.310 
here the curve
you<00:02:12.060> want<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.270> hide<00:02:12.330> use<00:02:12.570> for<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> way

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
you want to hide use for all the way

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.000 
you want to hide use for all the way
across<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> lights<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> come<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:16.010> now

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
across to get the lights to come on now

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.940 
across to get the lights to come on now
another<00:02:17.310> potential<00:02:17.820> problem<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.500> if<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.710> have

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
another potential problem is if you have

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.660 
another potential problem is if you have
the<00:02:20.280> channel<00:02:20.610> reversed<00:02:22.070> so<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.400> here

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the channel reversed so it's going here

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.700 
the channel reversed so it's going here
and<00:02:23.700> say<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.570> we're<00:02:25.290> checking<00:02:25.320> our

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
and say I have we're checking our

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.470 
and say I have we're checking our
endpoints<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.430> my<00:02:26.550> full<00:02:26.760> loan<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.120> bohon

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
endpoints it's my full loan but bohon

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.370 
endpoints it's my full loan but bohon
let's<00:02:28.260> say<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.500> my<00:02:28.800> pitch<00:02:29.040> was<00:02:29.280> reversed

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
let's say that my pitch was reversed

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.510 
let's say that my pitch was reversed
actually<00:02:31.380> reverses<00:02:31.800> what<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> want<00:02:32.250> let's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
actually reverses what you want let's

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.920 
actually reverses what you want let's
say<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.760> was<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:33.000> normal<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.600> hadn't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
say it was on normal you hadn't

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.680 
say it was on normal you hadn't
remembered<00:02:34.350> reverse<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.130> now<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:36.450> I'm<00:02:36.540> at

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
remembered reverse it now when I'm at

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.350 
remembered reverse it now when I'm at
low<00:02:36.870> pitch<00:02:37.170> I'm<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:38.010> number<00:02:38.400> 7<00:02:38.700> LEDs<00:02:39.030> come<00:02:39.240> on

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
low pitch I'm that number 7 LEDs come on

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
low pitch I'm that number 7 LEDs come on
thinking<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> should<00:02:39.959> be<00:02:40.260> high<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.709> that's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
thinking it should be high so that's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370 
thinking it should be high so that's
backwards<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.209> high<00:02:42.360> showing<00:02:42.900> low<00:02:43.110> so

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
backwards on that high showing low so

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.520 
backwards on that high showing low so
it's<00:02:43.470> telling<00:02:43.770> me<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:44.010> pitch<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.370> back<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
it's telling me my pitch is back so I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's telling me my pitch is back so I
just<00:02:46.800> need<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.550> reverse<00:02:48.920> my

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
just need to go in here and reverse my

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.760 
just need to go in here and reverse my
pitch<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.790> now<00:02:51.030> when<00:02:51.690> I'm<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:51.930> low<00:02:52.110> stick<00:02:52.470> and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
pitch so now when I'm at low stick and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.770 
pitch so now when I'm at low stick and
stomp<00:02:53.040> mode<00:02:53.250> my<00:02:53.610> number<00:02:53.940> three<00:02:54.120> LEDs<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.600> like

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
stomp mode my number three LEDs on like

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.199 
stomp mode my number three LEDs on like
it<00:02:54.930> should<00:02:55.170> should<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.130> from<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> high-stake<00:02:57.060> my

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
it should should be from a high-stake my

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.760 
it should should be from a high-stake my
number<00:02:57.480> seven<00:02:57.780> LG's<00:02:58.110> always<00:02:58.320> like<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.560> should

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
number seven LG's always like it should

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:07.240 
number seven LG's always like it should
so<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.610> pitch<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.940> now<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> correct<00:03:00.450> direction

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.740 

so<00:03:08.250> there's<00:03:08.430> multiple<00:03:08.670> things<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.540> could

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
so there's multiple things that could

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.290 
so there's multiple things that could
cause<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:11.010> light's<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.610> come<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.940> one

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
cause the light's not to come on one

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.170 
cause the light's not to come on one
your<00:03:12.480> channel<00:03:12.840> could<00:03:12.989> be<00:03:13.110> reversed<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:14.400> you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
your channel could be reversed to you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660 
your channel could be reversed to you
could<00:03:15.330> have<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.690> limit<00:03:16.290> endpoints<00:03:16.980> not<00:03:17.190> far

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
could have your limit endpoints not far

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.030 
could have your limit endpoints not far
enough<00:03:17.820> or<00:03:18.150> possibly<00:03:18.510> too<00:03:18.750> far<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.380> could

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
enough or possibly too far and you could

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.800 
enough or possibly too far and you could
have<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.340> curves<00:03:20.700> either<00:03:21.209> not<00:03:21.480> high<00:03:21.780> enough

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
have your curves either not high enough

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.800 
have your curves either not high enough
not<00:03:22.440> low<00:03:22.650> enough<00:03:22.680> or<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.880> remember<00:03:24.209> between<00:03:24.570> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
not low enough or so remember between so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.210 
not low enough or so remember between so
you<00:03:24.900> check<00:03:25.140> each<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.440> those<00:03:25.560> individually<00:03:26.130> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
you check each of those individually to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.410 
you check each of those individually to
get<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> lights<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.730> come<00:03:26.760> along<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:27.239> if<00:03:27.360> you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
get the lights to come along but if you

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.720 
get the lights to come along but if you
use<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.600> defaults<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:29.280> showed<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.640> the
