00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:22.520
 let's talk about the general aspects of 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.770
 a vice engine shows 50 cc 4 stroke 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.349
 as you can observe it the system 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.039
 of late books 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.170
 the rope starting system that acts on it 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.239
 directly on the shaft causing 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.570
 the engine is in operation this piece 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.390
 leaked 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.989
 pulls the air that is pushed by a 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.570
 to the engine in such a way that the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.570
 that the engine is cooled 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.649
 so it is the engine with cooling 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.800
 and whip that comes straight from the 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.649
 engine is the whip that will be connected to the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.379
 handle of the cut chain of your bicycle 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.539
 the black wire with the black wire and the wire 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.460
 green with green thread coming down from the frame 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.100
 current situation when these two children 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.960
 the engine is switched off is the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.470
 turn off the engine on the other side we have 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.690
 the clan box system that comes to be the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.560
 four engine clutch system 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.110
 is a simple piece composed of 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.649
 a small gear and a gear 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.890
 greater in those attached by a belt 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.319
 when they spin they transmit their strength 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.929
 for this pinion which in turn must 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.630
 connected to the transmission of your 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.170
 bicycle with the chain provided together 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.110
 with the kit it is important to note that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.380
 this part works grease lubricated 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.959
 that is, she is funny and this 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.810
 procedure must be carried out at least 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.810
 400 within 400 km
