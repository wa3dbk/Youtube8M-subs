Jadeja<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> say<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
Jadeja what you have to say about the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
Jadeja what you have to say about the
Indian<00:00:32.040> bowling<00:00:32.369> language<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.420> compared

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
Indian bowling language I think compared

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.479 
Indian bowling language I think compared
to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.410> Sri<00:00:34.559> Lankans<00:00:34.920> Indians<00:00:35.340> are

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to the Sri Lankans Indians are

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.040 
to the Sri Lankans Indians are
definitely<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> better<00:00:36.300> bowling<00:00:36.719> lineup

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
definitely a better bowling lineup

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
definitely a better bowling lineup
because<00:00:37.640> they<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:41.300> trump

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
because they have not just one trump

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
because they have not just one trump
card<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> Sri<00:00:43.410> Lankans<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.860> Malinga<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
card like the Sri Lankans have Malinga I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.950 
card like the Sri Lankans have Malinga I
mean<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.879> take<00:00:45.000> malinga<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> Sri

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
mean if you take malinga out of the Sri

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.569 
mean if you take malinga out of the Sri
Lankan<00:00:46.079> team<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
Lankan team I don't think they are a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
Lankan team I don't think they are a
capable<00:00:47.820> enough<00:00:48.420> bowling<00:00:48.840> side<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.680> India

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
capable enough bowling side but in India

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
capable enough bowling side but in India
you've<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> bullish<00:00:50.700> where<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.239> well

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you've got a bullish where one well

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
you've got a bullish where one well
unsurprisingly<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.039> best<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
unsurprisingly the best in this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
unsurprisingly the best in this
tournament

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
tournament

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.470 
tournament
you've<00:00:54.960> got<00:00:55.610> Ravindra<00:00:56.610> Jadeja<00:00:56.730> obviously<00:00:57.390> who

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you've got Ravindra Jadeja obviously who

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.319 
you've got Ravindra Jadeja obviously who
comes<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.050> his<00:00:58.170> vital<00:00:58.559> breakthroughs

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
comes in with his vital breakthroughs

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
comes in with his vital breakthroughs
and<00:01:00.739> even<00:01:01.739> Shawn<00:01:01.980> Sharma<00:01:02.340> played<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and even Shawn Sharma played well in

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.050 
and even Shawn Sharma played well in
India's<00:01:03.449> last<00:01:03.660> match<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.549> don't<00:01:05.760> rely<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
India's last match so they don't rely on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
India's last match so they don't rely on
one<00:01:06.420> person<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.960> Sri<00:01:07.110> Lanka<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> think

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
one person as Sri Lanka do so I think

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460 
one person as Sri Lanka do so I think
India<00:01:08.970> has<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> better<00:01:09.330> bowling<00:01:09.720> lineup<00:01:10.049> what

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

India has the better bowling lineup what
do<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.770> yeah<00:01:11.220> exactly<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.060> have

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
do you think yeah exactly and just have

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
do you think yeah exactly and just have

so<00:02:10.890> allowed<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.120> seen<00:02:12.300> how<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.569> Howie

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so allowed to be seen how if Howie

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.430 
so allowed to be seen how if Howie
against<00:02:13.660> India<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.960> didn't<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> good

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
against India I didn't have a good

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.620 
against India I didn't have a good
outing<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> 2011<00:02:15.790> World<00:02:15.940> Cup<00:02:16.210> in<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
outing in the 2011 World Cup in the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.990 
outing in the 2011 World Cup in the
final<00:02:17.020> yes<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.770> he<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.580> happy<00:02:18.670> erase

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
final yes so he is just happy erase

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.550 
final yes so he is just happy erase
those<00:02:19.150> memories<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.780> hope<00:02:19.960> for<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.200> best

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
those memories and hope for the best

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
those memories and hope for the best
so<00:02:20.770> exactly<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.370> X<00:02:21.580> Factor<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.240> with<00:02:22.510> Lasith

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
so exactly the X Factor is with Lasith

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.590 
so exactly the X Factor is with Lasith
Malinga<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.980> that's<00:02:24.820> an<00:02:25.000> opinion<00:02:25.270> that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
Malinga and that's an opinion that

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.990 
Malinga and that's an opinion that
everyone<00:02:26.200> shares<00:02:26.470> here<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.610> bowling

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
everyone shares here so the bowling

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.600 
everyone shares here so the bowling
lineups<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:29.140> see<00:02:29.380> India<00:02:29.920> may<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.460> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
lineups if you see India may have the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.270 
lineups if you see India may have the
edge<00:02:30.820> but<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:31.450> Sri<00:02:31.660> Lanka<00:02:32.020> might<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.980> have

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
edge but then Sri Lanka might just have

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.670 
edge but then Sri Lanka might just have
you<00:02:33.910> know<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.210> extra<00:02:34.660> zinc<00:02:34.990> at<00:02:35.200> times<00:02:35.470> you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you know the extra zinc at times you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.560 
you know the extra zinc at times you
know<00:02:35.710> they<00:02:35.920> may<00:02:36.070> be<00:02:36.100> just<00:02:36.550> image<00:02:37.090> they<00:02:37.420> might

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
know they may be just image they might

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.810 
know they may be just image they might
just<00:02:37.780> push<00:02:38.020> themselves<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.710> go<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.460> one

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
just push themselves to go that one

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.210 
just push themselves to go that one
level<00:02:40.090> extra<00:02:40.570> in<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:41.080> crucial<00:02:41.530> game<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.010> I

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
level extra in this crucial game and I

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.370 
level extra in this crucial game and I
think<00:02:42.280> Angelo<00:02:43.240> Matthews<00:02:43.630> should<00:02:44.170> bowl

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
think Angelo Matthews should bowl

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.530 
think Angelo Matthews should bowl
himself<00:02:44.770> more<00:02:44.950> often<00:02:45.250> because<00:02:45.850> he's<00:02:46.060> not<00:02:46.240> bold

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
himself more often because he's not bold

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.800 
himself more often because he's not bold
enough<00:02:46.810> overs<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:49.450> think<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.660> he

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
enough overs and I just think that he

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.360 
enough overs and I just think that he
could<00:02:49.990> provide<00:02:50.530> those<00:02:50.710> breakthroughs<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
could provide those breakthroughs in the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.030 
could provide those breakthroughs in the
middle<00:02:51.700> which<00:02:51.880> Sri<00:02:52.300> Lanka<00:02:52.630> don't<00:02:53.410> seem<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.860> get

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
middle which Sri Lanka don't seem to get

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.060 
middle which Sri Lanka don't seem to get
so<00:02:54.730> if<00:02:55.080> Matthews<00:02:56.080> had<00:02:56.230> bowled<00:02:56.470> more<00:02:56.740> than

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
so if Matthews had bowled more than

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.620 
so if Matthews had bowled more than
three<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.310> than<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.880> three<00:02:58.060> or<00:02:58.150> four<00:02:58.209> overs

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
three or than the three or four overs

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.540 
three or than the three or four overs
that<00:02:58.660> he<00:02:58.900> did<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.320> think<00:02:59.860> Sri<00:03:00.040> Lanka<00:03:00.280> would<00:03:00.430> have

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
that he did I think Sri Lanka would have

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.120 
that he did I think Sri Lanka would have
bowled<00:03:00.850> Australia<00:03:01.270> out<00:03:01.360> much<00:03:01.600> earlier<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.860> yes

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
bowled Australia out much earlier so yes

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.040 
bowled Australia out much earlier so yes
now<00:03:03.340> let's<00:03:03.700> take<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> final<00:03:04.360> call<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
now let's take a final call on the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.300 
now let's take a final call on the
winner<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:06.610> have<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.790> few<00:03:07.030> stats<00:03:08.040> 44<00:03:09.040> times

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310
