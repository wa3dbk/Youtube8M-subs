episode<00:00:11.190> we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.519> go<00:00:11.610> over<00:00:11.730> some<00:00:11.880> of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
episode we're going to go over some of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.789 
episode we're going to go over some of
the<00:00:12.030> history<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.809> technical<00:00:13.259> benefits<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the history the technical benefits and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.140 
the history the technical benefits and
the<00:00:13.860> development<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.460> 45-degree<00:00:15.120> offset

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the development of the 45-degree offset

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.130 
the development of the 45-degree offset
back<00:00:15.690> up<00:00:15.900> sights<00:00:16.850> some<00:00:17.850> early<00:00:18.119> discussion<00:00:18.690> was

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
back up sights some early discussion was

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.349 
back up sights some early discussion was
basically<00:00:19.859> around<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.430> aperture<00:00:20.880> size<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
basically around the aperture size and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.240 
basically around the aperture size and
there's<00:00:21.480> never<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:21.869> been<00:00:22.230> able<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
there's never really been able to be a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550 
there's never really been able to be a
clear<00:00:23.519> consensus<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.689> aperture<00:00:24.960> size<00:00:25.289> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
clear consensus on the aperture size so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
clear consensus on the aperture size so
we<00:00:26.010> did<00:00:26.160> some<00:00:26.310> development<00:00:26.730> early<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> with

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
we did some development early on with

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
we did some development early on with
multiple<00:00:27.660> aperture<00:00:28.050> sizes<00:00:28.320> mechanically

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
multiple aperture sizes mechanically

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
multiple aperture sizes mechanically
adjustable<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.150> here<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> had

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
adjustable so you got one here that had

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
adjustable so you got one here that had
four<00:00:31.170> different<00:00:31.289> aperture<00:00:31.740> sizes<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> could

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
four different aperture sizes you could

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400 
four different aperture sizes you could
rotate<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.910> posts<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.840> had<00:00:33.930> another<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
rotate the posts we had another one that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.840 
rotate the posts we had another one that
basically<00:00:34.829> had<00:00:35.070> two<00:00:35.250> different<00:00:35.399> aperture

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
basically had two different aperture

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.459 
basically had two different aperture
sizes<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.480> through<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> mechanism<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.320> could

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
sizes and through a mechanism you could

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.310 
sizes and through a mechanism you could
you<00:00:37.829> could<00:00:37.980> rotate<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.110> deploy<00:00:40.110> two

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you could rotate that to deploy two

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.860 
you could rotate that to deploy two
different<00:00:40.590> aperture<00:00:41.129> sizes<00:00:41.780> eventually<00:00:42.780> we

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
different aperture sizes eventually we

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
different aperture sizes eventually we
would<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.469> set<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.770> removable

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
would actually just set on a removable

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.520 
would actually just set on a removable
plastic<00:00:44.640> insert<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.480> lot<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.930> other<00:00:46.020> discussion

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
plastic insert a lot of other discussion

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.170 
plastic insert a lot of other discussion
was<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:47.039> given<00:00:47.309> towards<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> mechanism

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
was was given towards the mechanism

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
was was given towards the mechanism
itself<00:00:48.300> whether<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> site<00:00:49.050> should<00:00:49.260> lock<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
itself whether the site should lock in a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
itself whether the site should lock in a
in<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.610> position<00:00:50.640> should<00:00:51.390> lock<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> down

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
in an up position should lock in a down

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.420 
in an up position should lock in a down
position<00:00:52.100> whether<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> should<00:00:53.370> be

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
position whether it should be

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
position whether it should be
spring-loaded<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.719> course<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.079> did<00:00:55.260> some

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
spring-loaded and of course we did some

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.590 
spring-loaded and of course we did some
spring-loaded<00:00:56.280> sights<00:00:56.610> eventually<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.480> would

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
spring-loaded sights eventually we would

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
spring-loaded sights eventually we would
settle<00:00:57.870> basically<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> 300<00:00:59.370> meter<00:00:59.550> which

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
settle basically on the 300 meter which

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
settle basically on the 300 meter which
is<00:01:00.329> adjustable<00:01:00.870> windage<00:01:01.260> 600<00:01:01.770> meter<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is adjustable windage 600 meter which is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
is adjustable windage 600 meter which is
adjustable<00:01:02.760> windage<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.149> elevation<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.870> our

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
adjustable windage and elevation in our

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
adjustable windage and elevation in our
front<00:01:04.799> sight<00:01:05.180> standard<00:01:06.180> fixed<00:01:06.780> front<00:01:07.049> sight

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
front sight standard fixed front sight

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
front sight standard fixed front sight
which<00:01:07.409> had<00:01:08.010> an<00:01:08.159> adjustable<00:01:08.640> front<00:01:08.820> sight<00:01:08.970> post

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
which had an adjustable front sight post

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
which had an adjustable front sight post
much<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.630> an<00:01:09.750> a2<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> notice<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
much like an a2 if you notice the the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
much like an a2 if you notice the the
aluminum<00:01:12.000> bases<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.510> each<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.869> sights

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
aluminum bases for each of these sights

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.300 
aluminum bases for each of these sights
was<00:01:13.380> completely<00:01:13.890> different

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
was completely different

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.440 
was completely different
so<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:15.689> basically<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> micros<00:01:17.180> line<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so we basically with the micros line of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.280 
so we basically with the micros line of
sights<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.869> wanted<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> basically

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
sights we wanted to basically

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
sights we wanted to basically
standardize<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.189> base<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:21.000> could

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
standardize that base so that we could

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
standardize that base so that we could
use<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> different<00:01:22.229> Leafs

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
use the different Leafs

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
use the different Leafs
from<00:01:23.520> each<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.790> these<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.030> course<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> front

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
from each of these of course the front

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120 
from each of these of course the front
sight<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.170> completely<00:01:25.619> redesigned

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
sight had to be completely redesigned

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.789 
sight had to be completely redesigned
but<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> leaf<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> 300<00:01:27.930> meter<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> 600

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
but the leaf for the 300 meter and 600

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
but the leaf for the 300 meter and 600
meter<00:01:28.950> sight<00:01:29.250> we're<00:01:29.759> very<00:01:29.939> similar<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
meter sight we're very similar to the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.590 
meter sight we're very similar to the
legacy<00:01:31.110> sights<00:01:31.850> speaking<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> 600<00:01:33.479> meter

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
legacy sights speaking of the 600 meter

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
legacy sights speaking of the 600 meter
sight<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.409> drum<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.270> used

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sight you the drum that's that is used

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
sight you the drum that's that is used
the<00:01:36.750> rotating<00:01:37.170> drum<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.500> used<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the rotating drum that's used for the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
the rotating drum that's used for the
adjustable<00:01:38.909> elevation<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.990> were

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
adjustable elevation there were

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.569 
adjustable elevation there were
certainly<00:01:40.320> some<00:01:40.500> inspiration<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.340> drew

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
certainly some inspiration that we drew

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.300 
certainly some inspiration that we drew
that<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.210> drew<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.570> from<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that we drew on from that and this is a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.230 
that we drew on from that and this is a

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
German FG 42 is a paratrooper

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
German FG 42 is a paratrooper
paratrooper<00:01:48.240> gun<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:48.720> innovative<00:01:49.380> gun<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.920> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
paratrooper gun very innovative gun in a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
paratrooper gun very innovative gun in a
lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> ways<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> look<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> sight

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
lot of ways but if you look at the sight

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
lot of ways but if you look at the sight
here<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.920> basically<00:01:53.220> has<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> rotating<00:01:54.000> drum

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
here on it basically has a rotating drum

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.810 
here on it basically has a rotating drum
and<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.960> leaf<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:56.130> raises<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.790> lowers

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and a leaf that that raises and lowers

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
and a leaf that that raises and lowers
based<00:01:57.329> off<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> rotation<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.350> drum

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
based off of the rotation of that drum

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.319 
based off of the rotation of that drum
one<00:01:59.189> day<00:01:59.399> I<00:02:00.079> went<00:02:01.079> into<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.700> museum<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> would

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
one day I went into a museum and would

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.990 
one day I went into a museum and would
see<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> Winchester<00:02:04.500> lever-action<00:02:05.000> actually

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
see a Winchester lever-action actually

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.240 
see a Winchester lever-action actually
fitted<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
fitted with a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
fitted with a
very<00:02:08.850> similar<00:02:09.330> back<00:02:09.510> up<00:02:09.690> site<00:02:09.900> so<00:02:10.050> again<00:02:10.320> you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
very similar back up site so again you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.890 
very similar back up site so again you
can<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.740> rotating<00:02:11.310> drum<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:12.330> leaf<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
can see a rotating drum and a leaf that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.570 
can see a rotating drum and a leaf that
would<00:02:13.260> would<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.740> up<00:02:13.800> down<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.130> course<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.460> is

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
would would go up down of course this is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.280 
would would go up down of course this is
even<00:02:14.910> before<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.750> turn<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.140> century

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
even before the the turn of the century

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.770 
even before the the turn of the century
and<00:02:16.500> when<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.680> look<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.160> site<00:02:17.370> today<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and when you look at this site today the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.330 
and when you look at this site today the
mechanism<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.710> it's<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.070> extremely

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
mechanism on it it's it's extremely

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.180 
mechanism on it it's it's extremely
intricate<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.900> time<00:02:22.110> period<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.800> once<00:02:23.040> we

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
intricate for the time period so once we

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.410 
intricate for the time period so once we
on<00:02:23.430> once<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.970> these<00:02:24.120> kind<00:02:24.360> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
on once we have these kind of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.240 
on once we have these kind of
standardized<00:02:24.870> Leafs<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.380> was<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.860> started<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
standardized Leafs it was we started to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.130 
standardized Leafs it was we started to
think<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.490> some<00:02:26.670> other<00:02:26.970> applications<00:02:27.750> for

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
think of some other applications for

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.950 
think of some other applications for
them<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.180> 45-degree

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
them so here you can see the 45-degree

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.870 
them so here you can see the 45-degree
offset<00:02:30.990> sites<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.160> they're<00:02:32.490> very<00:02:32.670> similar

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
offset sites and they're very similar

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880 
offset sites and they're very similar
they<00:02:33.090> share<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> same<00:02:33.840> leaf<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:34.770> they

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
they share the same leaf but when they

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.200 
they share the same leaf but when they
mount<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> top<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.730> rifle<00:02:36.060> they're

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
mount to the top of the rifle they're

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.120 
mount to the top of the rifle they're
actually<00:02:36.540> sitting<00:02:36.720> at<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.990> at<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> 45<00:02:37.950> degree

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
actually sitting at a at a 45 degree

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.160 
actually sitting at a at a 45 degree
angle<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:39.240> should<00:02:39.450> kind<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.750> show<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:39.990> how

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
angle we should kind of show you how

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.010 
angle we should kind of show you how
that<00:02:40.350> how<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.220> works<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.510> see<00:02:42.690> here

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
that how that works so you can see here

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.950 
that how that works so you can see here
I'm<00:02:43.770> gonna<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.490> kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.090> standard<00:02:45.480> ar-15

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
I'm gonna on a kind of standard ar-15

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.840 
I'm gonna on a kind of standard ar-15
type<00:02:46.230> rifles<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.160> day<00:02:47.310> optic<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
type rifles you have your day optic and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.640 
type rifles you have your day optic and
then<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.540> these<00:02:48.720> backup<00:02:49.140> sights<00:02:49.380> here

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
then you have these backup sights here

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.370 
then you have these backup sights here
so<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.300> way<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.750> basically<00:02:52.080> works

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so the the way that this basically works

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.990 
so the the way that this basically works
is<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.800> your<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.280> your<00:02:53.610> standard

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
is you have your your your standard

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.400 
is you have your your your standard
optic<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.420> let's<00:02:54.600> say<00:02:54.750> you're<00:02:54.930> up<00:02:55.080> at<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.260> high

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
optic and let's say you're up at a high

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.990 
optic and let's say you're up at a high
power<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.520> feel<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.910> you

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
power on it and you you feel that you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.690 
power on it and you you feel that you
either<00:02:57.120> need<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.420> take<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> closer<00:02:58.620> shot<00:02:58.950> you

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
either need to take a closer shot you

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.670 
either need to take a closer shot you
can<00:02:59.910> easily<00:03:00.210> transition<00:03:00.750> from<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.140> day

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
can easily transition from that day

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.710 
can easily transition from that day
optic<00:03:02.100> right<00:03:02.670> over<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> back<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.420> iron's

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
optic right over to the back of iron's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.300 
optic right over to the back of iron's
by<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.140> quick<00:03:04.320> rotation<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.010> weapon

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
by just a quick rotation of the weapon

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
by just a quick rotation of the weapon
and<00:03:05.460> it's<00:03:05.550> only<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.790> matter<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.120> second<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.110> it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
and it's only a matter of second then it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.140 
and it's only a matter of second then it
takes<00:03:07.410> for<00:03:07.710> basically<00:03:08.490> less<00:03:08.640> than<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.850> second

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
takes for basically less than a second

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
takes for basically less than a second
that<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.330> takes<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.690> rotate<00:03:10.290> over<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.710> then

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that it takes to rotate over and then

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.590 
that it takes to rotate over and then
use<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.460> now<00:03:12.000> we're<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.300> go<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
use that now we're going to go to the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.699 
use that now we're going to go to the
product<00:03:12.780> demonstration<00:03:13.410> where<00:03:13.530> Jerry
