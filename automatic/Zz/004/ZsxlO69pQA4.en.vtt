00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.439
 diluvian of Saturday and the semi 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 neutralization of the race they have 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.219

 retains leadership position 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 general the stage of the day she herself was 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.270
 hectic up to kilometer 423 he 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.309
 there was no doubt 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.989
 giniel de villiers was gone for 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 impose and largely even problem at the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.329
 kilometer 423 more than giniel so it's 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 nani roma who finds himself leading to 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.229
 a few minutes by stéphane 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.880
 peterhansel no problem for peters 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 since rva was anyway to more 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.900
 an hour at the general de villiers at 44 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.659
 minutes and especially that nasser al attiyah 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.520
 has struggled like never before many stops 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.830
 for the qatari who finds himself a 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.259
 once again stopped at 4 km 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.820
 of arrival 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.409
 the dakar has seen a turning point today 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.080
 fart years she finds herself alone 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.479
 solidly in the lead less than a huge 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.540
 hitch a 11th title gives him the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.540
 arms 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 in the motorcycles of upheaval in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.719
 this step that hurt david 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.979
 casteu victim of shock with a cow 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.469
 yeah those are things that happen 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.210
 the leader of the general classification loses 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.319
 almost half an hour he suffers from a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.840
 shoulder trauma 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.709
 maybe a dislocation but nothing sure 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.990
 fall also for chaleco lopez 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.310
 survivors among the favorites and not 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.600
 less since it is all 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.420
 simply the title holder cyril 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
 després and joan barreda no mistake 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.289
 for loans they had time to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.390
 catch up on casteu and whose injury 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.430
 of his rival involuntarily makes the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.140
 casteu business who after his injury 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.569
 experiencing mechanical problems is 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 forced to stop to repair at a 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.440
 thirty kilometers from the finish 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.180
 and to add to the luck of the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.519
 title is a very bad state 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.370
 possible for olivier bread old leader 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.959
 from general to arrival cyril després 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.910
 wins this stage in this hour 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.280
 41 minutes and 36 seconds 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.160
 it is more than 4 minutes ahead joan 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.760
 barreda then alessandro botturi and at 7 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.379
 minutes 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.109
 ruben faria and that's all the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.450
 problem from the meadows counted 13 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.220
 minutes late on faria so this is 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.250
 the Portuguese who takes the lead 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.250
 general
