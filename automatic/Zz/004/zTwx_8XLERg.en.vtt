00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
those are new newly added to the library

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:40.080

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.090 

so<00:02:53.070> not<00:02:53.490> much<00:02:54.420> argument<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.890> all

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
so not much argument here at all

frontpoint's the regrade materials the
Sun<00:02:59.160> points<00:02:59.460> and<00:02:59.580> midpoints<00:03:00.620> do<00:03:01.620> seem<00:03:01.890> more

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
Sun points and midpoints do seem more

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.840 
Sun points and midpoints do seem more
common<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:07.680> honestly<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.370> don't<00:03:08.520> think
