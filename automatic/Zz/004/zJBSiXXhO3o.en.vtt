00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
explained the lag is there because

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.120 
explained the lag is there because
certain<00:03:58.080> somebody's<00:03:58.530> bored<00:03:58.799> with<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:58.980> game

Sam<00:03:59.489> real<00:03:59.670> who<00:03:59.880> lives<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.480> same<00:04:00.570> houses<00:04:01.019> I

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
Sam real who lives in the same houses I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.560 
Sam real who lives in the same houses I
do<00:04:01.320> he<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.280> bored<00:04:02.489> with<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.700> game<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:02.910> my<00:04:03.390> only

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
do he is bored with the game and my only

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.600 
do he is bored with the game and my only
guess<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.840> he's<00:04:04.170> been<00:04:04.380> downloading<00:04:04.950> Skyrim

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
guess is he's been downloading Skyrim

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880 
guess is he's been downloading Skyrim

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.449 
and such all day every day and that is
probably<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.260> reason<00:04:10.470> cause<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.920> my<00:04:11.010> lack<00:04:11.190> I

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
probably the reason cause of my lack I

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.039 
probably the reason cause of my lack I
mean<00:04:11.760> those<00:04:11.940> definitely<00:04:12.360> was<00:04:12.480> lag<00:04:12.780> or

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
mean those definitely was lag or

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.330 
mean those definitely was lag or
