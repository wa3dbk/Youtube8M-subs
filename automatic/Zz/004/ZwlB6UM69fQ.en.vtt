00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.590 

let<00:00:00.989> me<00:00:01.140> give<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.530> thoughts<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:02.190> the

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:02.600 
let me give my thoughts on the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.630 
let me give my thoughts on the
Peacekeeper<00:00:04.130> this<00:00:05.130> has<00:00:05.310> never<00:00:05.460> happened

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
Peacekeeper this has never happened

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.839 
Peacekeeper this has never happened
before<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.420> Call<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> Duty<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.529> DLC<00:00:08.340> getting<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
before in Call of Duty and DLC getting a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.780 
before in Call of Duty and DLC getting a
new<00:00:09.059> weapon<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.780> know<00:00:10.620> you're<00:00:10.830> excited<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.580> was

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
new weapon I know you're excited I was

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
new weapon I know you're excited I was
excited<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> set<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.139> class<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.799> used<00:00:14.040> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
excited so I set up a class and used it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.390 
excited so I set up a class and used it
immediately<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.890> say<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
immediately and I have to say that this

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.420 
immediately and I have to say that this
gun<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> actually<00:00:18.000> pretty<00:00:18.539> good<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.220> will<00:00:20.220> be

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
gun is actually pretty good I will be

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
gun is actually pretty good I will be
using<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.740> it<00:00:22.740> barely<00:00:23.460> has<00:00:23.789> any<00:00:23.820> recoil<00:00:24.560> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
using it it barely has any recoil so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.700 
using it it barely has any recoil so
it's<00:00:25.710> kind<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.310> ACR<00:00:27.560> apparently<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it's kind of like an ACR apparently the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's kind of like an ACR apparently the
damage<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> pretty<00:00:29.519> low<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> doesn't

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
damage is pretty low but that doesn't

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150 
damage is pretty low but that doesn't
matter<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.080> mean<00:00:31.320> look<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:31.740> killing<00:00:32.130> people

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
matter I mean look I'm killing people

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.720 
matter I mean look I'm killing people
pretty<00:00:32.669> easily<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:34.010> if<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> difference<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
pretty easily so if the difference is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.979 
pretty easily so if the difference is
one<00:00:35.969> or<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.270> bullets<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:37.800> notice

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
one or two bullets I don't really notice

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
one or two bullets I don't really notice
for<00:00:39.989> me<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.559> accuracy<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.820> gun<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.390> low

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
for me the accuracy of this gun the low

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.529 
for me the accuracy of this gun the low
recoil<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.590> makes<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.300> extremely<00:00:45.300> useful

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
recoil is what makes it extremely useful

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.930 
recoil is what makes it extremely useful
why<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.320> use<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> gun<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.190> doesn't<00:00:47.640> really

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
why not use a gun that doesn't really

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.690 
why not use a gun that doesn't really
have<00:00:48.180> any<00:00:48.390> recoil<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.809> works<00:00:49.110> great<00:00:49.700> another

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
have any recoil that works great another

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
have any recoil that works great another
plus<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.840> unlock<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.949> silencer

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
plus is that you can unlock the silencer

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
plus is that you can unlock the silencer
really<00:00:53.850> early<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.840> some<00:00:55.110> guns

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
really early on you don't have some guns

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
really early on you don't have some guns
you<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> silencer<00:00:57.030> until<00:00:57.390> level

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you don't get the silencer until level

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.069 
you don't get the silencer until level
15<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.980> something<00:00:59.190> nice<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.719> able<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
15 or something nice so I was able to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.590 
15 or something nice so I was able to
set<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> class<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:02.100> silence<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.270> ghosts

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
set up a class go silence with ghosts

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.410 
set up a class go silence with ghosts
like<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.989> normally<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.650> really<00:01:05.460> early<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
like I normally do really early on so I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.250 
like I normally do really early on so I
like<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.670> but<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> found<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.689> funny

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
like that but I found this to be funny

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.469 
like that but I found this to be funny
David<00:01:10.619> Vonderhaar<00:01:11.010> said<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.330> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
David Vonderhaar said that if you're in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.520 
David Vonderhaar said that if you're in
a<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.200> somebody<00:01:13.590> has<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.299> peacekeeper

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
a game and somebody has a peacekeeper

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.170 
a game and somebody has a peacekeeper
you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.979> pick<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.549> off<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> ground

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you can just pick it up off the ground

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.859 
you can just pick it up off the ground
and<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:20.340> how<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> possible

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and use it but how is that possible

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
and use it but how is that possible
because<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> DLC<00:01:23.520> how

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that I can think of I just think it's

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.919 
that I can think of I just think it's
weird<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> they<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.849> split<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
weird that they would split that up you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.029 
weird that they would split that up you
know<00:02:09.959> why<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
know why would they do that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.420 
know why would they do that
and<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:12.000> course<00:02:12.420> host<00:02:12.870> migration
