headphones<00:03:15.530> also<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:16.340> know<00:03:16.430> if<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.670> had<00:03:16.850> them

the side is on the left side so if you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.770 
the side is on the left side so if you

were laying on your left ear you might

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.390 
were laying on your left ear you might
press<00:03:27.050> them<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.410> pause<00:03:27.620> you're<00:03:27.860> off<00:03:27.980> your

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
audio or whatever so you probably are

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.990 
audio or whatever so you probably are
limited<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.830> only<00:03:30.860> your<00:03:31.370> right<00:03:31.520> side<00:03:31.730> if

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
you're lying on them but you could do it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.930 
you're lying on them but you could do it
and<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.590> done<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.160> it's<00:03:34.280> very<00:03:34.700> very

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
and I have done that so it's very very

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.530 
and I have done that so it's very very
convenient

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
convenient

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.990 
convenient
so<00:03:35.990> there<00:03:36.560> are<00:03:36.590> rocket<00:03:37.070> fish<00:03:37.220> RF<00:03:37.520> NAB<00:03:37.820> 2

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
so there are rocket fish RF NAB 2

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.870 
so there are rocket fish RF NAB 2
