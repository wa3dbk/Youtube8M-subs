00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.950
 electronic module for washing machines 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.680
 indesit and ariston 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.869
 This module is based on modules. 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.550
 Arcadia 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.109
 original number c 20 and 27 divided by 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.570
 This module is delivered but to me 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.100
 stitched it suggests that this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.620
 module approach to a very large 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.480
 the number of models puts the car can 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.400
 stitched under the required model 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.010
 washing machine before shipping 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.750
 client on this module can not be 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.250
 flash us on any model the rest 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.260
 indesit and ariston machines 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.420
 but only on those models for which you 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.940
 fits a list of which models 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.170
 fit this module you can find 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.390
 visiting our website 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.600
 detailed description of this module all 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.119
 see also the module which is bought 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.059
 we are stitched absolutely free 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:07.610
 that is, when you buy a module, you put 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.920
 just for the module here we actually see 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 the module itself is already Yalta 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.439
 the main board she sees several 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.890
 connectors for connecting wires and 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.610
 also 20 module 1 module itself is a pulse 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.610
 your food 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.100
 and the second charge is the demand pay as well 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.440
 I wanted to draw attention to the fact that we 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.600
 were on the Arcadia platform very similar 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.060
 among themselves but they can be absolutely 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.490
 different therefore visual these modules 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.020
 select should not be given 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.750
 only according to the original part number 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.970
 this parts so that they can accurately 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.350
 feeding unit on your machine you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.090
 need to know the full model 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.730
 earring number and commercial move 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 washing machine the same data to us 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.160
 need to know that from the module 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 flash specific machine model so 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.910
 if you order this module 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.950
 then in the comments to the order you need 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.890
 specify all the data that I have listed 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.710
 namely the full model of Jeremy and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.030
 commercially on a virtual machine 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.230
 if in the comments order is given 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.420
 information not specified 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.610
 it sounds like you repaint the module 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.950
 do not need that is you can sew it 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.840
 independently on this order from the window 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.610
 by the comments that are written 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 that you need to flash a specific model 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.930
 and we got the firmware 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.090
 if you have doubts that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 thats can fit you then better in 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.709
 comments clarify what you believe 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.270
 accordance with our model since we 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.489
 we can flash the module for the data 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.200
 which you indicated and in doing so we are not 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.030
 check the approach of this module or not 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.160
 if there was no request in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.010
 comments sounds original 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.180
 supplied by indesit this 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.230
 video thieves for the site 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.230
 master plus audio
