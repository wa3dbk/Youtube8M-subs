really neat in person the ones that I
originally<00:01:09.490> pick<00:01:09.940> for<00:01:10.150> solid<00:01:10.510> chrome<00:01:10.810> with<00:01:11.409> a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
originally pick for solid chrome with a

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.640 
originally pick for solid chrome with a
similar<00:01:11.770> spoke<00:01:12.220> pattern<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.869> for<00:01:14.440> some

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
similar spoke pattern but for some

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.870 
similar spoke pattern but for some
reason<00:01:14.979> they<00:01:15.070> were<00:01:15.159> just<00:01:15.250> rubbing<00:01:15.670> on<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
reason they were just rubbing on the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.340 
reason they were just rubbing on the
back<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.299> they<00:01:16.390> could<00:01:16.570> not<00:01:16.690> get<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.020> stop

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.680 
back and they could not get it to stop

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
and so we picked these instead these

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.050 
and so we picked these instead these
look<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.020> sharp<00:01:20.290> though<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:24.610> people<00:01:24.880> say<00:01:25.030> I
