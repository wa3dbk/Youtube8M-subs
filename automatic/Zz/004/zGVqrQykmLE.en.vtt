00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
because the ends of the leaves go Brown

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.950 
because the ends of the leaves go Brown
doesn't<00:00:13.019> look<00:00:13.170> very<00:00:13.349> nice<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:15.509> ones<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.870> are

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960

sticking<00:00:16.260> straight<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.760> I'm<00:00:17.760> going<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> prune

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
sticking straight up I'm going to prune

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.359 
sticking straight up I'm going to prune
down<00:00:18.449> quite<00:00:18.720> low

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
down quite low

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.130 
down quite low
once<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.580> side<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.150> might<00:00:21.480> need<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> grow<00:00:21.930> out<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
once the side I might need to grow out a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.320 
once the side I might need to grow out a
little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.279> want<00:00:23.330> pasture

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330

in the back those new buds will start to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280 
in the back those new buds will start to
grow<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.209> will<00:02:24.480> instead<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.840> having<00:02:24.989> one

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.360 
grow and will instead of having one
shoot<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.920> that's<00:02:29.129> how<00:02:29.250> we

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
shoot will have do and that's how we

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.780 
shoot will have do and that's how we
thicken<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.970> our<00:02:31.220> foliage<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:33.180> larch<00:02:33.569> I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
thicken up our foliage this larch I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.809 
thicken up our foliage this larch I
think

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
think

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.140 
think
I<00:02:37.150> started<00:02:38.019> growing<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.469> around<00:02:38.859> about<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
I started growing this around about the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.380 
I started growing this around about the
1990s

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
1990s

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.119 
1990s
so<00:02:40.930> he's<00:02:41.049> around<00:02:41.260> about<00:02:41.379> 25<00:02:41.980> years<00:02:44.040> grew<00:02:45.040> in

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
so he's around about 25 years grew in

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.250 
so he's around about 25 years grew in
front<00:02:45.370> seed<00:02:45.639> he's<00:02:46.269> now<00:02:46.480> got<00:02:46.659> a<00:02:46.719> beautiful

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
front seed he's now got a beautiful

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.030 
front seed he's now got a beautiful
trunk<00:02:47.790> everything<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.939> this<00:02:49.120> tree<00:02:49.389> has<00:02:49.659> been

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
trunk everything on this tree has been

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.309 
trunk everything on this tree has been
shaped<00:02:51.040> by<00:02:51.299> pruning<00:02:52.299> only<00:02:52.840> there's<00:02:52.989> been<00:02:53.139> no

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
shaped by pruning only there's been no

shaped by pruning only there's been no
wiring<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.129> tree<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:55.030> everything<00:02:55.659> here

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
wiring on this tree so everything here

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.030 
wiring on this tree so everything here
I've<00:02:56.109> proved<00:02:56.469> shape<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.590> we've<00:02:59.769> got<00:02:59.859> some
