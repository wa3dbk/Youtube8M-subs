00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
single pull switches are pretty basic

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.869 
single pull switches are pretty basic
you've<00:00:42.170> all<00:00:42.320> flipped<00:00:42.620> one<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.190> many<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.790> us

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
you've all flipped one and many of us

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.630 
you've all flipped one and many of us
have<00:00:44.059> installed<00:00:44.449> them<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:45.470> just<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.250> case<00:00:46.280> you

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
have installed them but just in case you

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.970 
have installed them but just in case you
haven't<00:00:47.030> I'm<00:00:47.390> going<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.809> show<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.019> how<00:00:48.320> but

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
haven't I'm going to show you how but

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.790 
haven't I'm going to show you how but
first<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.340> all<00:00:49.400> what<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.510> switch<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:51.380> switch

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
first of all what is a switch a switch

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.580 
first of all what is a switch a switch
is<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:52.550> non<00:00:52.850> load<00:00:53.239> device<00:00:53.660> which<00:00:54.230> means<00:00:54.470> it

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
is a non load device which means it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.100 
is a non load device which means it
doesn't<00:00:54.920> consume<00:00:55.250> power<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:56.420> opens<00:00:56.899> and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
doesn't consume power that opens and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.740 
doesn't consume power that opens and
closes<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.530> circuit<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.399> single<00:00:59.239> pulse<00:00:59.450> which

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
closes a circuit a single pulse which

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.010 
closes a circuit a single pulse which
does<00:01:00.649> this<00:01:00.890> from<00:01:01.550> one<00:01:01.760> location<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:02.989> let's

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
does this from one location so let's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.580 
does this from one location so let's
water<00:01:03.440> one<00:01:03.680> up<00:01:04.390> here<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.420> have<00:01:05.660> my<00:01:05.869> power<00:01:06.170> coming

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
water one up here I have my power coming

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.070 
water one up here I have my power coming
in<00:01:06.770> over<00:01:07.520> here<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.729> have<00:01:08.030> my<00:01:08.180> light<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.810> in<00:01:08.990> the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
in over here I have my light and in the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.020 
in over here I have my light and in the
middle<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.530> my<00:01:09.740> switch<00:01:10.220> electricity

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
middle I have my switch electricity

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.020 
middle I have my switch electricity
travels<00:01:11.750> in<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.110> loop<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.009> black<00:01:13.280> wire<00:01:13.550> is<00:01:13.580> the

that's<00:01:14.750> your<00:01:14.899> incoming<00:01:15.410> power<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.369> white

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
that's your incoming power the white

the<00:01:24.140> circuit<00:01:24.590> will<00:01:24.740> not<00:01:24.979> work<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:26.000> switch

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
the circuit will not work the switch

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.330 
the circuit will not work the switch
always<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.959> only<00:01:27.110> controls<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> hot<00:01:28.100> wire

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
switch so you have your hot and neutral

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.770 
switch so you have your hot and neutral
coming<00:01:33.740> into<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.130> box<00:01:34.340> with<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.880> switch<00:01:35.179> then

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
coming into the box with the switch then

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.660 
coming into the box with the switch then
you<00:01:35.899> have<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.110> black<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.709> a<00:01:36.860> white<00:01:37.039> leaving

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
you have a black and a white leaving

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.270 
you have a black and a white leaving
their<00:01:37.819> box<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.390> running<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.869> light<00:01:39.280> between

that is referred to as a switch lake in
some<00:01:45.470> applications<00:01:46.190> we<00:01:46.520> switch<00:01:46.819> light<00:01:47.060> will

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
some applications we switch light will

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.109 
some applications we switch light will
be<00:01:47.660> color<00:01:47.899> purple<00:01:48.410> instead<00:01:48.709> of<00:01:48.830> black<00:01:49.160> if<00:01:49.910> it

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
be color purple instead of black if it

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.969 
be color purple instead of black if it
isn't<00:01:50.390> purple<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:50.959> good<00:01:51.170> practice<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.740> put<00:01:51.920> a

isn't purple it's good practice to put a

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.100 
isn't purple it's good practice to put a
little<00:01:52.190> pearl<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.819> it<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.599> in<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.869> future

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
little pearl in it so that in the future

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.020 
little pearl in it so that in the future
you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.590> distinguish<00:01:55.099> between<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.610> incoming

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
you can distinguish between the incoming

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.120 
you can distinguish between the incoming
hot<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.810> switch<00:01:57.050> light<00:01:57.289> this<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.920> really

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
hot and the switch light this is really

hot and the switch light this is really
handy<00:01:58.369> believing<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.869> now<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.259> know<00:02:00.289> what

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
handy believing so now that we know what

matter<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:34.200> terminating<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.980> wires

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
matter when terminating the wires

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400 
matter when terminating the wires
I<00:02:35.550> recommend<00:02:36.180> bending<00:02:36.510> little<00:02:36.780> hooks<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
I recommend bending little hooks on the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.350 
I recommend bending little hooks on the
ends<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.830> wire<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.310> wrapping<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.120> hook

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
ends of the wire and wrapping that hook

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.480 
ends of the wire and wrapping that hook
around<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> screw<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.830> will<00:02:41.010> hold<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.340> lot

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
around the screw this will hold a lot

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.970 
around the screw this will hold a lot
better<00:02:41.760> also<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> safety<00:02:43.200> precaution<00:02:43.320> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
better also as a safety precaution I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.290 
better also as a safety precaution I
would<00:02:44.160> wrap<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.580> whole<00:02:44.760> thing<00:02:45.060> with

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
would wrap the whole thing with

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.680 
would wrap the whole thing with
electrical<00:02:45.840> tape<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.260> couple<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.800> times<00:02:47.690> so

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
electrical tape a couple of times so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.840 
electrical tape a couple of times so
that<00:02:48.840> completes<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> switch<00:02:49.620> when<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.550> screw

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
that completes the switch when you screw

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.850 
that completes the switch when you screw
it<00:02:50.940> into<00:02:51.060> place<00:02:51.180> make<00:02:51.630> sure<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.350> off<00:02:52.530> don't
