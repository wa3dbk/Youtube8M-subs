the irq choice that you have for the
touchscreen<00:00:50.039> interface<00:00:56.239> let's<00:00:57.239> show<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
touchscreen interface let's show you the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.270 
touchscreen interface let's show you the
working<00:00:57.899> demo<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.199> comes<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> board

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:18.740 

let's<00:01:02.280> restart<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> board

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.110 

we're<00:01:19.380> planning<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.890> slow<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
we're planning it's slow so it's more of

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.300 
we're planning it's slow so it's more of
a<00:01:21.180> graphical<00:01:21.720> effect<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.320> anything<00:01:22.620> if<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.070> do

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
a graphical effect on anything if we do

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030 
a graphical effect on anything if we do
it<00:01:23.430> full<00:01:23.610> speed<00:01:23.760> its<00:01:24.120> incident<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.260> wanted

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it full speed its incident so I wanted

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.440 
it full speed its incident so I wanted
to<00:01:26.100> slow<00:01:26.370> things<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to slow things down so you can see it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.150 
to slow things down so you can see it
drawing<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:32.270> drawing<00:01:33.270> random<00:01:33.510> squares

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
drawing it out drawing random squares

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.290 
drawing it out drawing random squares
with<00:01:35.160> random<00:01:35.490> colors<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.270> thing

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
with random colors and the same thing

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.550 
with random colors and the same thing
with<00:01:36.600> circles<00:01:41.900> simple<00:01:42.900> little<00:01:42.990> keep<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.470> in

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
with circles simple little keep it in

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.000 
with circles simple little keep it in
her<00:01:43.650> face

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010
