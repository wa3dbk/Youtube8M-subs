is<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.480> text<00:02:57.750> look<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.080> can<00:02:58.860> show<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
is the text look like can show you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.790 
is the text look like can show you
because<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.959> basically<00:03:01.350> an<00:03:01.530> e-reader

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
because it is basically an e-reader

right<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.150> still<00:03:06.360> has<00:03:06.540> our<00:03:06.840> our<00:03:08.630> bespoke

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
right so it still has our our bespoke

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.350 
right so it still has our our bespoke
custom<00:03:10.440> around<00:03:11.250> reading<00:03:12.030> experience<00:03:14.360> looks

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
custom around reading experience looks

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.570

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
like you that's just our cloud sensitive

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.690 
like you that's just our cloud sensitive
well<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.019> e<00:03:19.049> reading<00:03:19.410> experience<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.370> has

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
well so the e reading experience is has

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.970 
well so the e reading experience is has
evolved<00:03:21.090> from<00:03:21.239> box<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.799> line<00:03:22.950> with
