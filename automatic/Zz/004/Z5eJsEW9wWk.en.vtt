00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.980
 Hello dear subscribers and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.070
 viewers today i will try to talk about 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 whom would hun chapter 1 combo we will be on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 4 hits 10 demage is pressed but square 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.869
 square triangle square look 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.869
 how she looks like 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.829
 well, a fairly simple combo don't think that 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.870
 you have problems 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:45.000
 beyond the second combo on three hits 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.750
 removes the d3d car quite a bit 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.089
 takes off is pressed back xxx 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.460
 it is needed for in cases where 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.769
 the opponent often presses the upper block 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.909
 because the first strike begins with 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.570
 lower with a lower blow look like it 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.570
 looks like 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.820
 also simple enough cubes 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.380
 Next we look at combinations 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.610
 have a combo with two different endings 1 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.460
 us combo for three hits means blows 14 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.870
 Demage is pressed she triangle 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.920
 round wheel and at the same time square x 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.920
 look how she looks 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.120
 with pressing at the same time you already 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.370
 understand yourself how to you 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.130
 press or program and shift 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.310
 and this as you prefer and 2 is 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.860
 continuation already 3 here is this combo on y 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.870
 his third blow is a little different there 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.720
 also also three hits on only 15 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.300
 Demage is pressed she triangle 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:12.290
 round wheel and square triangle together 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:16.030
 look finishes off hats so further 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.330
 hour we will blur more complex combos 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:26.120
 here is one of them is on 6 hits blows down 20 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.200
 demage in this combo we will 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.000
 use the spin this one also give in 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.230
 kick it down the round wheel she pushes 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.280
 pressed combo square square 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.440
 the triangle spin is down-forward square 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.160
 square jump with leg 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.660
 dive kick blows 6 hits 20 day 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.660
 look how she looks 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.980
 but easy too my every 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.310
 combination but now will be godfather 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.870
 which will show quite complicated me 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.300
 it took minutes to torture 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.990
 ten to fifteen to make it up 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.330
 of the end I will tell you now in the process 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.280
 than complexity but for me personally so for 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.930
 start this 9th hit combo it blows down 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.280
 she blows down 22 demage she is pressed 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.020
 square squared i see as 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.910
 begins the same com as previous 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.090
 triangle then spin 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.510
 this down-forward squared dash forward 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.040
 square dash forward further square 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.560
 square and triangle ground giants well 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.400
 throws hat throws hat now quickly 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.680
 I will say how it is down back triangle yet 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.360
 I repeat quickly 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.180
 square square triangle spin this 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.640
 down 1 square dash period square b 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.930
 squared squared triangle and it turns out 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.190
 down back a triangle somewhere 9 hit 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.480
 crazy as I said before this 22 demage 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.520
 its what it looks like i'll tell you what 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.520
 I personally had difficulty 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.009
 the difficulty was with me just these three 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 hitting do follow after last 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.490
 Dasha click push square 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.100
 it's hard for me to put a triangle 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.050
 triangle ie long enough 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.690
 suffered well and the hat too but the hat is not 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.280
 It seems to me difficult to do so and we approach 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.810
 to the final combo which uses 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.759
 x-ray is also pretty easy 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.310
 google here are some very combinations 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.389
 easy to make them pressed square 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.139
 square triangle 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.919
 spin it down pirate square and 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.340
 x-ray is 8 hit combo 34 d image 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.340
 look 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.490
 Well, that's all I wanted to show you in 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.830
 this combo idiot kung lao see you soon 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.060
