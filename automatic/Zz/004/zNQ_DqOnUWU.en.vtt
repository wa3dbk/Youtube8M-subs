00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that they shouldn't help her because

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
that they shouldn't help her because
she's<00:01:58.890> been<00:01:59.070> complicit<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> terror<00:02:00.270> only

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
she's been complicit in the terror only

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
she's been complicit in the terror only
when<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.110> affects<00:02:01.380> her<00:02:01.740> does<00:02:01.979> she<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
when it affects her does she want to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.999 
when it affects her does she want to
change<00:02:02.790> her<00:02:03.000> tune<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:04.170> agreed<00:02:04.560> quickly

felt<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.759> funky<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.539> clunky<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.410> it's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
felt a little funky and clunky but it's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.520 
felt a little funky and clunky but it's
possible<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:12.450> part<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.900> her<00:02:13.020> plan

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
possible that this is a part of her plan

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
possible that this is a part of her plan
she's<00:02:13.830> duping<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> rebels<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.790> she's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
she's duping the rebels that she's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
she's duping the rebels that she's
trying<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.720> make<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.140> her<00:02:16.410> mistake<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
trying to make up for her mistake and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
trying to make up for her mistake and
ultimately<00:02:17.460> bring<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.970> rebels<00:02:18.270> into<00:02:18.510> custody

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
ultimately bring the rebels into custody

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.320 
ultimately bring the rebels into custody
and<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.740> just<00:02:20.010> her<00:02:20.130> strategy<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.090> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
and this is just her strategy to do so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.060 
and this is just her strategy to do so
that's<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.840> my<00:02:21.990> prediction<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.650> guess<00:02:22.890> we'll

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
that's just my prediction I guess we'll

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950 
that's just my prediction I guess we'll
see<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> crew<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> ghost<00:02:24.330> go<00:02:24.600> down<00:02:24.780> to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
see so the crew of the ghost go down to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.540 
see so the crew of the ghost go down to
loathe<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.350> with<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> plan<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.190> extract

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
loathe all with a plan to extract

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.180 
loathe all with a plan to extract
Minister<00:02:27.390> tua<00:02:27.660> they<00:02:28.020> encounter<00:02:28.470> resistance

Minister tua they encounter resistance
agent<00:02:29.520> Kallus<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.420> minister

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
agent Kallus is there with the minister

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.930 
agent Kallus is there with the minister
the<00:02:31.440> rebels<00:02:31.770> tell<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> minister<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.610> go<00:02:32.640> into

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the rebels tell the minister to go into

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.550 
the rebels tell the minister to go into
the<00:02:33.030> shuttle<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.540> evacuate<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.260> when<00:02:34.410> she

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the shuttle to evacuate but when she

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.130 
the shuttle to evacuate but when she
enters<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.160> shuttle<00:02:35.490> explodes<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> guess

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
enters the shuttle explodes so I guess

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.440 
enters the shuttle explodes so I guess
we<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.500> assume<00:02:37.620> she's<00:02:38.160> dead<00:02:38.520> unless<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.240> was

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
we can assume she's dead unless this was

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.540 
we can assume she's dead unless this was
all<00:02:39.660> part<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.020> her<00:02:40.140> plan<00:02:40.380> which<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.860> don't<00:02:41.040> think

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
all part of her plan which I don't think

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.730 
all part of her plan which I don't think
it<00:02:41.670> was<00:02:41.850> now<00:02:42.150> she<00:02:42.660> seemed<00:02:42.900> quite<00:02:43.050> sincere<00:02:43.620> in

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
it was now she seemed quite sincere in

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.770 
it was now she seemed quite sincere in
her<00:02:43.860> desire<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.220> escape<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.330> rebels<00:02:45.600> take

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
her desire to escape so the rebels take

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.630 
her desire to escape so the rebels take
off<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.260> try<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.650> away<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.100> they<00:02:47.489> are

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
off and try to get away but they are

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.060 
off and try to get away but they are
shot<00:02:47.880> down<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.360> becomes<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.750> foot<00:02:49.020> chase<00:02:49.050> we<00:02:49.830> cut

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
shot down it becomes a foot chase we cut

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.250

attempting to leave loathe all should be

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.080

has<00:02:57.570> really<00:02:57.900> been<00:02:58.050> nice<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.620> was<00:02:58.950> worried<00:02:59.310> about

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
has really been nice I was worried about

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.220 
has really been nice I was worried about
it<00:02:59.640> honestly<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.060> didn't<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.690> wanted<00:03:01.050> to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
it honestly I didn't think I wanted to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.930 
it honestly I didn't think I wanted to
see<00:03:01.470> him<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:02.130> they're<00:03:02.280> doing<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.670> good<00:03:02.880> job

using him so far very subtle scenes

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
and hiding out isn't safe so they decide

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.699 
and hiding out isn't safe so they decide
that<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.360> last<00:03:18.540> place<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.049> Empire<00:03:19.320> will<00:03:19.560> look

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
great scene where Ezra tries to use the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.720 
great scene where Ezra tries to use the
Jedi<00:03:24.930> mind<00:03:25.170> trick<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> stormtrooper<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.610> he
