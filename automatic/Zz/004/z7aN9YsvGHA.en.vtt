00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
made now is it enough to make the entire

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.120 
made now is it enough to make the entire
world<00:03:38.299> quit<00:03:38.989> their<00:03:39.139> cable<00:03:39.440> service<00:03:39.799> or<00:03:39.950> dish

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
probably not but isn't in a step

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.740 
probably not but isn't in a step
direction<00:03:44.090> where<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.420> could<00:03:44.630> potentially

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
direction where that could potentially

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.470 
direction where that could potentially
be<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.260> future<00:03:46.000> absolutely<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.150> am<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.420> for
