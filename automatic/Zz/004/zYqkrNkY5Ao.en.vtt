00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
very hot so to make it softened we have

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.579 
very hot so to make it softened we have
to<00:00:49.039> soak<00:00:49.339> this<00:00:49.579> field<00:00:49.909> cap<00:00:50.210> yoga<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.839> water<00:00:51.140> for

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
slice them easily so I am going to soak

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.039 
slice them easily so I am going to soak
it<00:01:00.859> for<00:01:01.100> 20<00:01:01.460> minutes<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.059> after<00:01:02.359> 20<00:01:02.869> minutes

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.279 
it for 20 minutes and after 20 minutes
of<00:01:03.320> soaking<00:01:03.879> use<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.909> dry<00:01:05.330> cloth<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.780> wipe<00:01:06.020> off

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
of soaking use a dry cloth to wipe off

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.190 
of soaking use a dry cloth to wipe off
the<00:01:06.500> water<00:01:06.770> over<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.429> tapioca<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.080> is

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
the water over the tapioca and it is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.090 
the water over the tapioca and it is
ready<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.710> slice<00:01:11.050> so<00:01:12.050> here<00:01:12.289> I<00:01:12.319> have<00:01:12.440> my<00:01:12.679> slice

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
ready to slice so here I have my slice

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.180 
ready to slice so here I have my slice
or<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:14.479> adjust<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.319> blade<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.950> most

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
or just adjust the blade to the most

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:26.410 
or just adjust the blade to the most
thin<00:01:16.490> point<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.210> slice<00:01:24.080> your<00:01:24.319> tapioca<00:01:25.420> make

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
thin point and slice your tapioca make

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.510 
thin point and slice your tapioca make
sure<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.080> are<00:01:27.170> slicing<00:01:27.470> your<00:01:27.860> tapioca

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
sure that you are slicing your tapioca

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.570 
sure that you are slicing your tapioca
into<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> very<00:01:29.270> thin<00:01:29.390> slices<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:31.039> more<00:01:31.250> thin

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
into a very thin slices the more thin

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.020 
into a very thin slices the more thin
more<00:01:32.240> crispy<00:01:32.840> chips<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.350> will<00:01:33.560> get<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.399> your

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
more crispy chips you will get so your

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.809 
more crispy chips you will get so your
slices<00:01:35.780> should<00:01:36.049> be<00:01:36.200> thin<00:01:36.470> like<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.759> I

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
slices should be thin like this so I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.619 
slices should be thin like this so I
have<00:01:38.000> already<00:01:38.149> sliced<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:39.619> tapioca<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:41.420> now

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:41.629 
have already sliced one tapioca so now

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.680 
have already sliced one tapioca so now
it<00:01:41.959> is<00:01:41.989> ready<00:01:42.319> to<00:01:42.530> go<00:01:42.739> into<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.129> hot<00:01:43.700> oil<00:01:43.729> so

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
it is ready to go into the hot oil so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.749 
it is ready to go into the hot oil so
let<00:01:44.840> me<00:01:44.959> show<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.200> how<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.500> fry<00:01:45.830> them<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:49.550> here

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
let me show you how to fry them so here

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.930 
let me show you how to fry them so here
I<00:01:49.819> have<00:01:49.910> oil<00:01:50.899> which<00:01:51.289> is<00:01:51.440> preheated<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:52.819> you

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
I have oil which is preheated so if you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.850 
I have oil which is preheated so if you
drop<00:01:53.209> a<00:01:53.239> piece<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.810> tapioca<00:01:54.200> if<00:01:54.739> it

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
drop a piece of tapioca if it

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.219 
drop a piece of tapioca if it
immediately<00:01:55.310> comes<00:01:55.819> up<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.019> right

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
immediately comes up it is the right

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.729 
immediately comes up it is the right
temperature<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.099> drop<00:01:58.849> all<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.330> tapioca

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
temperature so drop all the tapioca

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.710 
temperature so drop all the tapioca
slices<00:02:00.739> one<00:02:01.009> by<00:02:01.190> one<00:02:01.429> very<00:02:01.670> fastly<00:02:02.149> into<00:02:02.569> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
slices one by one very fastly into the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:14.410 
slices one by one very fastly into the
oil

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.670 

using<00:02:15.319> your<00:02:15.440> spatula<00:02:15.710> just<00:02:16.250> flip<00:02:16.730> them

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
using your spatula just flip them

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.370 
using your spatula just flip them
otherwise<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.950> will<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.310> burnt<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.380> flipping

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
otherwise it will get burnt and flipping

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.570 
otherwise it will get burnt and flipping
this<00:02:21.620> helps<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.280> cookie<00:02:22.700> or<00:02:22.790> tapioca<00:02:23.080> evenly

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
this helps to cookie or tapioca evenly

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.070 
this helps to cookie or tapioca evenly
instance<00:02:25.580> they<00:02:25.819> stop<00:02:26.120> your<00:02:26.330> car<00:02:26.510> chips<00:02:26.840> or<00:02:27.020> a

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
instance they stop your car chips or a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.699 
instance they stop your car chips or a
very<00:02:27.890> thin<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:29.209> will<00:02:29.480> get<00:02:29.690> cooked<00:02:29.900> very<00:02:30.290> soon

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
very thin it will get cooked very soon

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.830 
very thin it will get cooked very soon
so<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.280> don't<00:02:31.610> need<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.910> cook<00:02:32.060> for<00:02:32.120> very<00:02:32.540> long

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
so you don't need to cook for very long

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.500 
so you don't need to cook for very long
time<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:33.380> 20<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.800> 25<00:02:34.730> seconds<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.300> enough

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
time just 20 to 25 seconds is enough

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.650 
time just 20 to 25 seconds is enough
once<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.709> changed<00:02:37.310> into<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.850> light<00:02:38.240> brown

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
once it's changed into a light brown

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.000 
once it's changed into a light brown
color<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:39.770> can<00:02:39.980> immediately<00:02:41.709> strain<00:02:42.709> from

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
color you can immediately strain from

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.940 
color you can immediately strain from
oil<00:02:43.400> into<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.850> paper<00:02:44.480> towel<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.260> absorb<00:02:45.380> excess

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
oil into a paper towel to absorb excess
