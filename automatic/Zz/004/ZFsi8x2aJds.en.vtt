00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to all and all his calls 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.120
 passion it was for I did I do 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.620
 this video to solve a problem 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.379
 that you can have 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.119
 how I have twice it's actually 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:23.070
 when you go on the apple store or 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:27.980
 of course itunes store a message from 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 alert appears where there is written itunes 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 the connection between is impossible so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 I make this video to solve you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.649
 this problem that you may have sprung 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 twice it happened to me that cache 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.020
 often can not open then so 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 I managed to solve these problems 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.570
 informing on the internet knowing that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 I have very difficult between the solution 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.430
 but in fact it's very simple so I 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.000
 will you explain that right now 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 so already checked before all theirs 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 was hourly if your time is fine 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.080
 settled so for this go in the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 general settings 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 she is in date and time and you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.920
 set well automatic tuning and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.950
 check that it's the right time 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.040
 then checked in the settings 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.689
 go back in general check that the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.580
 software update and comes damon 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.530
 why you look up to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.829
 day signing here again one of setting 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 day to do charge then go 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.799
 go in wii so if you have if you 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.200
 are in wifi checks though you 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.920
 capture well the wii fit so you're 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.090
 well in the wifi coverage and if you 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 are network parent so this is one of the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 cell waves so for that was going 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.070
 in once again in the settings 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 in general again and in 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.830
 cell so me I'm not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.180
 when I have an ipod touch 4 is recorded and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.829
 maybe 4 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.430
 but there is no network is that wii 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.200
 made or not called so if you have 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.079
 a phone go dancing muller and 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.599

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:30.989
 I'll let you know it's this 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.859
 times any manipulation so that the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.760

 it's trying to reset the wii 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.840
 did it by simply unplugging wifi and 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:11.069
 we recognized it once 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.590
