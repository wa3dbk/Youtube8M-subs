00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.920
 two doors exclusive spirit colors 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.630
 sports and are just three ingredients 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.250
 who came to develop a new 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.200
 civic 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.210
 and behind this aggressive appearance he 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.559
 deliver everything that we expect or 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.559
 Be fun at the wheel. 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.110
 discretion forget that word 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 the pomegranate sporting does not matter 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.430
 none of hiding your true 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.370
 vocation is the site initially by 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 bodywork coupe bumper design 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 exclusive 18-inch wheels 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560
 airfoil 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.260
 besides the whole tradition of the acronym 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.460
 is the engine grew cylinder capacity relative to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.330
 Now the previous generation and delivery of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.330
 106 horses 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 but it is only possible that started at 72 is a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.869
 model released by compact car wave 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:48.289
 low price and the idea is precisely the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.929
 sell a lot here in brazil is 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:57.509
 possible that arrived in the fifth generation in the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:59.640
 At the beginning of the 90's he remembers 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 first civilian who came and on this Thursday 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.259
 came a very cool thing too. 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.259
 what was possible coming 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.510
 It's more a matter is complicated than 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.849
 to record a single that veered the car that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.150
 people have also come in this generation 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.150
 fantastic direct the 8,500 rpm 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.930
 This one is already going to tell you in 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:33.989
 details nÃ© ii 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.989
 but the grand balcony of the round with the civic 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.060
 was the new civic and a car that came in 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.819
 eighth generation in Brazil in 2006 and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.689
 2007 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.840
 You remember it was a car. 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.480
 revolutionary bell until his design 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.909
 today the generations that came after them 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
 are drinking from this source in truth but not 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.239
 there is much to change 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.939
 of that car that is aesthetically very 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.379
 close to perfection until he sold a lot and 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.909
 no dream of consumption among the sedans 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.620
 and it was in this 8th generation that it was 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.290
 released version 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 calm people walked already had a difference 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.219
 of wheel and such but exactly arose 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.219
 this time, right? 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.340
 we now have the new civic is if this car 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.690
 was released last year in the press 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.390
 It's made in Canada. 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.910
 it is difficult for them in the street so that one 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.250
 car that draws a lot of attention to you 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.970
 walk with him and note that the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:58.040
 People really look pretty 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.800
 he is having a detail beyond the details 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.620
 outlines the fact that 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.080
 would not be the sole fault and 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.780
 factors wheel 18 in the forum in a car 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.569
 very striking has only four colors in it. 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.360
 catalog between them 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.880
 particularly I would look red 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.720
 and orange right one that is red 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.930
 has an orange and black and white on 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.250
 My opinion is sports color 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.690
 If you really are going to have a car 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.910
 buy one of these two 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.150
 colors that have everything to do with the spirit 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.190
 car indoor living is cool 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.930
 also because in addition to being aesthetically 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.700
 internally outside the wave 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.330
 caprichou in the details 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.419
 caprichou in the camp is is a civic ne 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.970
 The panel is then the same at this point but 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.880
 here the transmission of six gears and 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.530
 People get there on this steering wheel alone . 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.270
 three-spoke small diameter which is a 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.340
 thing that the civics also have a 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.370
 very cool feature , right? 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.380
 and finally the panel and with 22 levels nec 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.610
 also a thing since in the beginning the 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.650
 people spoke more personally if 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.650
 got used to this idea well 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.400
 macpherson independent suspension in the 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.590
 front and multilink on the back lets 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.330
 the car stuck on the floor 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.970
 it has the slip differential 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.600
 limited this is a great balcony of 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.229
 round and this car has 206 horses in the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.889
 second the football dynamometer 208 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.930
 it can even put more poison 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.850
 that he will walk well even has a 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.010
 combined that walks in sao paulo that walks 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.100
 giving work to the most 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.700
 powerful which was the balance of the store was 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.700
 mounted 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.130
 more or less 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.220
 this is the idea then in general 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.110
 he is a fun guy does not have a 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.220
 here on the panel up there in the 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.710
 itec 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.770
 There are already three red oranges when 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.349
 It was red. It's on the right spot. 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.080
 to add torque all power is 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.030
 available in other words it 's time to 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.479
 accelerate and how the gears are 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:36.180
 Shorts you get out 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:37.860
 stepping on and holding the high interest is 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.960
 because the very short hair well stepped 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.780
 dinho 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.720
 This makes it quite fun and it's all over. 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.039
 disrespecting the worst of people in the good 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.229
 sense of the word 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.610
 It's hard to resist speeding up this guy. 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.610
 to our consumption was low 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.960
 in fact this car is one of the few 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.770
 options with manual sport transmission 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.419
 we have a citroen ds3 also the golf 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.330
 gti the rival of this car but is a 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:10.409
 automatic fun too clear 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.990
 but for you to feel the 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.820
 old fashioned emotion the best style 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.039
 gentleman driver has to be a manual 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.849
 This is never going to be replaced. 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:23.099
 You know that's what we see next time. 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.680
 driving cool things will get the ds3 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:29.180
 I also go after a golf gti so the 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.180
 Interesting grounds in the garage
