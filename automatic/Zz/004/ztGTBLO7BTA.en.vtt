00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.340
 hello everyone I'm ark they took a 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:09.200
 new tutorial on how to get runes 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.720
 tutorial they asked me and well you can 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.660
 I've been thinking and I think I'll do it 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.410
 easy and quickie we would also like 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.410
 tell you that I've asked for mine from big ram 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.449
 194 I 've lost it because of problems with bed 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.699
 safe in bed and I 've lost him and now 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.010
 I have here and in another part of health 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.779
 good more than anything to get the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.419
 runes we'll have to go to the shredder it 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.700
 can break an object or crush 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.980
 resources and we will take resources 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.360
 serves to get the stones and the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 medals 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 but this does not interest us what we 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.720
 interesting are breaking an object break a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.630
 object does not mean for example 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.170
 break resources so we buy this 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.950
 resource 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.900
 nothing will come out 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.870
 so to get for example to see 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.890
 that we want a life route 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.730
 because this is the mockery yesterday are 7 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.730
 life, we break it 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.719
 do not forget a magic fragment 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.640
 this much in a magical fragment we 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:18.710
 will come out several we have to double click 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.320
 that mole a life of three authority 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.270
 we have to get one thing very 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 interesting what people would like 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.950
 go out to a bread branch or from pm to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.010
 consign a d for we will have to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.310
 break some objects that have bread and 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.590
 those of pm those of pm those of pm are more 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.040
 easy to come out that the bread 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.210
 why always 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 I do not know how they are runes 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.920
 of these already great that are worth theirs 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.720
 it costs to remove them for example 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.680
 let's break this adventurous field not knowing 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.470
 anything 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.450
 we can break also in groups suppose 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.450
 all this and break the equipment 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.670
 so we have to say that if you do 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.290
 it can also fail that it is very easy 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.180
 that fail 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.649
 the same has left all these routes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.770
 the spots 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.780
 the power 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.990
 they had some objects that they do not give you 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
 nothing for example would be the peeps of the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.550
 pawns who have nothing but to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.850
 sometimes you get some I think 95% do not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.850
 they give you 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.040
 Look now has left us and throw alliance 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.040
 tab although I'm going to break it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.570
 we have achieved achievements normally to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.570
 sometimes it comes out and sometimes it does not 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.720
 I have shields for all people 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.120
 interest 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.620
 this is not directly at all 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.050
 when the people are correct to 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.000
 failed 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.490
 and well this would be all to get 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.030
 these runes I'm to get the ones from 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.590
 greater caliber than would be those of 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.180
 those of 30 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.709
 we would have to break for example a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.099
 ring that gave 100 to vitality 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.599
 between a few days environment 30 the vitamin 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.060
 and well this is the new video tutorial 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:20.670
 and if they need any more in the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.670
 description that many thanks to God
