00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.039 
it really looked mad when I got it it
kind<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.219> had<00:01:03.120> seen<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.600> better<00:01:03.780> days

now<00:02:24.650> what's<00:02:25.650> interesting<00:02:25.829> though<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.400> when

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
now what's interesting though is when

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.140 
now what's interesting though is when
you<00:02:27.390> flip<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:27.659> this<00:02:27.989> way<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.790> goes<00:02:29.939> by

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
you flip it this way and it goes by

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.629 
you flip it this way and it goes by
