obviously against a raw this weekend it
was<00:06:36.430> pretty<00:06:36.730> humiliating<00:06:37.000> earlier<00:06:37.690> in<00:06:37.810> the

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
was pretty humiliating earlier in the

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.510 
was pretty humiliating earlier in the
season<00:06:38.080> you<00:06:38.380> weren't<00:06:38.560> around<00:06:38.680> but<00:06:39.040> the<00:06:39.310> boys

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
season you weren't around but the boys

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.060 
season you weren't around but the boys
really<00:06:39.930> wanting<00:06:40.930> together<00:06:41.260> 10<00:06:41.710> well

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
really wanting together 10 well

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.530 
really wanting together 10 well
nothing's<00:06:42.610> really<00:06:42.760> changed<00:06:43.000> this<00:06:43.180> week<00:06:43.240> at

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
nothing's really changed this week at

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.270 
nothing's really changed this week at
training<00:06:43.780> you<00:06:44.110> know<00:06:44.260> it's<00:06:44.470> sort<00:06:44.590> of<00:06:44.740> we're<00:06:45.160> all

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
training you know it's sort of we're all

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.550 
training you know it's sort of we're all
aiming<00:06:45.460> just<00:06:45.790> to<00:06:46.000> get<00:06:46.570> back<00:06:46.720> in<00:06:46.960> in<00:06:47.200> a<00:06:47.320> winner's

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
aiming just to get back in in a winner's

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.320 
aiming just to get back in in a winner's
circle<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:48.070> i<00:06:48.100> think<00:06:48.280> we<00:06:48.370> showed<00:06:48.970> that<00:06:49.030> last

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
circle and i think we showed that last

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.490 
circle and i think we showed that last
week<00:06:49.540> so<00:06:49.750> hopefully<00:06:49.810> we<00:06:50.020> can<00:06:50.140> just<00:06:50.170> keep<00:06:50.380> this

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
week so hopefully we can just keep this

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.200 
week so hopefully we can just keep this
form<00:06:50.800> into<00:06:51.160> the<00:06:51.250> final<00:06:51.670> so<00:06:51.880> it's<00:06:52.060> nothing

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
form into the final so it's nothing

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.810 
form into the final so it's nothing
really<00:06:52.390> in<00:06:52.720> particular<00:06:52.990> on<00:06:53.890> last<00:06:54.280> performance

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
really in particular on last performance

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:03.399 
really in particular on last performance
against<00:06:55.030> the<00:06:55.180> understand

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:03.409 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.469
