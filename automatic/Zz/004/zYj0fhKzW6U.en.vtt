00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.140
 yourself and could also be 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.450
 something that you could not be except 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.420

 when drawing I try to project the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.050
 my way of feeling myself in a way of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.760
 to be about communicating emotions 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.760

 always turned to the past 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.810
 so you start from the tradition there is 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.480
 was overwhelmed by the collapse of boulders at 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.480

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.080
 the image of a woman who 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.920

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.170

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.520
 that everyone knows what product could 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.500

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.450

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.250

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.510
 more graphic appearance more similar to 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.600

 that maybe you see normally in 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.900

 participation in the next generation 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:36.610
 arises from a desire to emphasize the 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.610
 principle of the made in Italy 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.430

 self-confidence was parting 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.990

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.680
 low of the true value of Italian e
