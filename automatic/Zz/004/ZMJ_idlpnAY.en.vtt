00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
I've got something that the I devices

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.979 
I've got something that the I devices
are<00:03:50.189> certainly<00:03:50.609> missing<00:03:51.030> another<00:03:51.720> feature

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
are certainly missing another feature

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.420 
are certainly missing another feature
that<00:03:52.139> I<00:03:52.319> think<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.680> guarantee<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.340> we're

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
that I think is a guarantee that we're

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.740 
that I think is a guarantee that we're
finally<00:03:53.609> going<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:53.909> see<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.239> universal

tether since iphone OS 3.1 out almost a

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.090 
tether since iphone OS 3.1 out almost a
year<00:04:19.320> ago<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:20.459> we<00:04:20.579> don't<00:04:20.880> have<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.209> for

year ago but we don't have that for
18<00:04:22.760> teeth<00:04:23.060> maybe<00:04:23.360> we'll<00:04:23.600> see<00:04:23.750> some<00:04:23.930> sort<00:04:24.140> of

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
18 teeth maybe we'll see some sort of

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
tethering or iPad tethering people can

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.410 
tethering or iPad tethering people can
use<00:04:27.680> their<00:04:27.980> Wi-Fi<00:04:28.160> device<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:29.240> conjunction

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
use their Wi-Fi device in conjunction

use their Wi-Fi device in conjunction
with<00:04:29.900> their<00:04:30.650> iphone<00:04:31.340> certainly<00:04:32.180> would<00:04:32.270> be<00:04:32.330> a

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
with their iphone certainly would be a

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.320 
with their iphone certainly would be a
feature<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.260> would<00:04:33.530> be<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:34.340> welcome

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
feature that I think would be a welcome

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
we going to see new hardware i don't

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.400 
we going to see new hardware i don't
think<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:55.640> i<00:04:55.970> think<00:04:56.300> we're<00:04:56.660> going<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.900> see<00:04:56.960> just

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
think so i think we're going to see just

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.290 
think so i think we're going to see just
the<00:04:57.650> operating<00:04:58.160> system<00:04:58.550> shown<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:58.940> existing

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
the operating system shown on existing

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.930 
the operating system shown on existing
3gs<00:05:00.170> ipod<00:05:01.040> touch<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.960> ipad<00:05:02.960> hardware<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.550> think

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
3gs ipod touch and ipad hardware I think

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.980 
3gs ipod touch and ipad hardware I think
we're<00:05:05.030> not<00:05:05.150> going<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.480> a<00:05:05.510> new<00:05:05.690> iphone

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
we're not going to see a new iphone

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.720 
we're not going to see a new iphone
until<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.380> june<00:05:06.560> or<00:05:06.680> july<00:05:06.710> time<00:05:07.160> frame<00:05:07.400> seems

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
until the june or july time frame seems

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.180 
until the june or july time frame seems
to<00:05:07.880> be<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:09.050> general<00:05:09.080> consensus<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.950> the<00:05:10.010> path

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
to be the general consensus and the path

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.100 
to be the general consensus and the path
that<00:05:10.220> Apple<00:05:10.580> has<00:05:10.610> followed<00:05:11.030> in<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.180> past<00:05:11.450> so

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
that Apple has followed in the past so

a lot of competition and all that

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.770 
a lot of competition and all that
competition<00:05:31.040> is<00:05:31.400> sort<00:05:31.700> of<00:05:31.790> shouting<00:05:32.480> from<00:05:32.720> the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
competition is sort of shouting from the
