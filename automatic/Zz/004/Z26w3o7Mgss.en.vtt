00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.350
 it is of course expected that the impetus for this will be a father in eindhoven 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.990
 and not only has a fair number of visitors to Alkmaar that does it 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.490
 also good under trainer ernest faber in the first ten 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.729
 a league 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.049
 see if that is clearly visible in this competition 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.699
 az with martens from the left 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.619
 and see pellet herein in the peak 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.009
 shot from the turn of katia so add that up 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.060
 not participate from the start 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.689
 holman comes from the right in midfield scarce elm and wernbloom 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.000
 just sergio romero 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.880
 in the goal, so verbeek has decided that this match is going very seriously 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.100
 take 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.400
 early in his favor to do much more for this 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.290
 straight 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 tackle is included 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.690
 with yellow cards to be given by referee tom van sichem 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 then a free kick is added in the direction of ruud swinkels 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.650
 the black wall 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.940
 and here the egg winch is the beautiful goal 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 unfortunately had to be 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.650
 both you make them from a free kick 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.980
 not sharper not more beautiful 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.350
 unfortunately put yes then you get a standing ovation of course 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.440
 rasmus elm 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.080
 this is definitely art 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.080
 and a nice start for a start later that we will not forget 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.159
 Holman frequently googled central once again a foul on him again 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.159
 a free kick again the keeper of eindhoven 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.160
 and therefore also the wall mrs 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.170
 state that even after I can do it again he tries it down 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 but he was unable to determine it, moreover, suggests being picked up by the British 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.470
 stores 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.010
 a big compliment to eindhoven in this competition they are doing extremely well and 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.050
 also seriously do their best to make it look for the attack with 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 ivo rossen jelle van crosses and jeffrey quickly especially 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.450
 the man who comes from the right who is very dangerous now the danger came 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.110
 this man not mature 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.490
 a bit the man with the free role on the side of he conjures 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.439
 back through the middle combine the weather holman is involved and already 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.439
 playable on holder with some playing time on the left 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:21.559
 they always run in utrecht, the market also comes out pretty well 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.359
 if so it is at the break elop 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.669
 and you can call that a compliment 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.129
 for eindhoven 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.420
 The second half was Eindhoven so is still in the match 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.900
 but there he is a lot of freedom at the front playing points 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.299
 do you have the family 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.799
 it seems to radiate but also for those who had not seen it 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.519
 so it happened the block pretty well 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.659
 from pellÃ¨ mendes all the space for pontus wernbloom to beat them 2 0 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.069
 the match seems to be played especially as you are 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.269
 the body language 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.739
 at eindhoven with faber with the jingles and now also with the players in the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.899
 field 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.759
 those are allowed to play football 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.139
 polman now once from right basic good play the net too late 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.409
 most defenders regularly go too fast 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.079
 Gertjan Verbeek can be quite satisfied with no damage to it 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.739
 cup duel regularly the slight profit and then see if eindhoven can still do something 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.220
 did you t is the man with the movements 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.129
 he doesn't get the ball tire 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.379
 yet again here again in Eindhoven 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.209
 one of calling 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.369
 a nice possibility though 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.299
 that is why they were nice to sit 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.049
 he is not being finished 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.889
 by screeching 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.889
 moments later a free kick for eindhoven with sjors paridan 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.679
 in the cases 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.859
 shary an's pressing 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.149
 only really on john romain cancels the euro 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.199
 no connection fight so for Eindhoven 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.519
 nhz the ICT quietly around 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.389
 let the ball of walk nice other even goes forward counter is still 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.379
 close to 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.749
 but it doesn't get too crazy 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.249
 the same picture in the final phase 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.069
 those from Eindhoven are tired 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.829
 play superleague 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.669
 and then gaps arise the dismissed carelessness voted on the street 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.889
 room for doing 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.599
 is of course not being celebrated 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.139
 top man is the man who finally manages to work him in 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 that does quite nicely from the air 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.890
 az move wins with 3 0 from eindhoven 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.650
 so he goes on to the last sixteen in the cup tournament
