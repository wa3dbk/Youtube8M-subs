 video today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.250
 little tutorial to find out how 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.559
 register your ps3 friends with your 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.329

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.420
 and as too sharkoon admit and more 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.510
 I saw several tutorials like what he 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.180
 had to use your micro usb on 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.489
 your computer and a bluetooth microphone 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.420
 on your pleasure ps too 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.930
 personally I found the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.089
 solution to put your micro usb 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.760
 volley your micro usb on your console 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.830
 and saved separately so if you have 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.750
 a second microphone that can connect 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.070
 on the pc you can put it 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.390
 I personally use my 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.680
 phone I will put a small picture 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.900
 I personally use my 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.290
 phone to record my voice with 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.119
 said actos phone if you have not ben 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.979
 Too bad and you will have to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.049
 unravel with the old method 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.270
 so as you could see at the beginning of 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.270
 the video have interviewed wish 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.579
 send this video side by side cf 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.890
 the good plan of the geek and apply it vctv 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.270
 so thanks to them if they claude me so 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.619
 now we're gone I'm explaining 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.049
 how donated in the first place you 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.100
 have in accessories settings of 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.109
 accessories settings you go to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.240
 pÃ©riers device settings to jo 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.409
 and there you have that at the level of the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 microphone input peripherals and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.960
 output device 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 so me it's gray and it's normal 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.819
 I do not have the headphones plugged into the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.899
 console 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.850
 I am talking to you in 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.049
 theory so in input device that 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.880
 change not leave you your box so 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.590
 me it's only one hour or so 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.329
 or if you have newt with 196 points 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.100
 and in output device 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.389
 you're going to put devices from 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.310
 system by default so why 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.960
 system default devices that to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.830
 bring out the sound of your game by the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.840
 speakers of your TV so that's 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.959
 do I personally use age 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.180
 pv at the age of p to 2 so 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.459
 appreciated with your case if you have any 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.100
 white and red connection to connect 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.420
 to your your acquisition budget me 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.910
 personally I do not use I have 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.400
 never tested but I leave it like that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.170
 that for me it changes 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.150
 so yes so these devices the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.420
 system by default that will make out the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.680
 its by voting so me with my home 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.880
 the initiation it's a double it makes its 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.209
 they are not reported there are by the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.800
 software and yeah so after once 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.300
 that it's done you're good 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.280
 admit you go on black ops the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.420
 you invite a friend and me for the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.620
 first time I tested I wanted 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.480
 test this technique there I knew 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.660
 not and I realized that it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.180
 worked great after he needed 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.470
 increase the sound of the voices and lower his 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.069
 of the game if you want to hear your friends 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.390
