missed<00:04:31.710> my<00:04:32.100> second<00:04:32.850> 10th<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.180> bench<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.750> I

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
missed my second 10th on bench and if I

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.570 
missed my second 10th on bench and if I
would<00:04:33.960> have<00:04:34.050> got<00:04:34.199> the<00:04:34.470> second<00:04:35.040> 10th<00:04:35.220> on<00:04:35.400> bench

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
would have got the second 10th on bench

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.600 
would have got the second 10th on bench
I<00:04:35.729> would<00:04:35.760> have<00:04:35.970> had<00:04:36.060> over<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.750> 1200<00:04:37.740> pound<00:04:38.400> ra--

total<00:04:38.970> at<00:04:39.030> 181<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.650> think<00:04:40.800> my<00:04:41.070> goal<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.520> with

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
total at 181 so I think my goal is with

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.390 
total at 181 so I think my goal is with
only<00:04:41.970> four<00:04:42.240> weeks<00:04:42.449> of<00:04:42.570> prep<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:44.280> know
