answer right okay

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.740 
answer right okay
so<00:01:57.110> answer<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.320> question<00:01:58.920> backwards<00:01:59.750> okay

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so answer this question backwards okay

yes click the answer
it's<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.320> answer<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.950> answer<00:02:06.000> yes<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.420> it

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
it's the answer the answer yes it is it

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's the answer the answer yes it is it
is<00:02:07.690> put<00:02:08.370> finger<00:02:09.370> on<00:02:09.610> here<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> put<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.830> on

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
is put finger on here do I put it on

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.740 
is put finger on here do I put it on
here<00:02:12.190> or<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.820> actually<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.420> put<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.660> on

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
here or I actually have to put it on

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.420 
here or I actually have to put it on
that<00:02:13.900> bit<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:14.740> don't<00:02:15.130> touch<00:02:15.400> blue<00:02:17.130> once<00:02:18.130> I

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
that bit now don't touch blue once I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.120 
that bit now don't touch blue once I
just<00:02:19.060> have<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.390> go<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.620> next<00:02:20.950> question

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
just have to go and then next question

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.210 
just have to go and then next question
that<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:22.180> super<00:02:22.480> easy<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.470> square<00:02:23.800> root<00:02:24.040> of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
that was super easy the square root of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.960 
that was super easy the square root of
an<00:02:24.400> onion

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
an onion

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.720 
an onion
it's<00:02:25.590> shallots<00:02:26.590> because<00:02:26.950> shallots<00:02:27.370> are<00:02:27.550> made

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it's shallots because shallots are made

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.100 
it's shallots because shallots are made
like<00:02:27.910> Charlotte's<00:02:28.300> are<00:02:28.420> small<00:02:28.660> bits<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.930> onion

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
like Charlotte's are small bits of onion

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.290 
like Charlotte's are small bits of onion
yes<00:02:29.560> we're<00:02:29.890> doing<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.580> answer<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.030> really

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
yes we're doing it the answer is really

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.910 
yes we're doing it the answer is really
big<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.560> biggest<00:02:32.860> thing<00:02:33.220> here<00:02:33.460> is<00:02:33.790> infinity

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
big the biggest thing here is infinity

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.910 
big the biggest thing here is infinity
no<00:02:35.920> um<00:02:36.550> but<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.720> guess<00:02:37.960> an<00:02:38.110> elephant's<00:02:38.620> really

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
no um but I guess an elephant's really

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.250 
no um but I guess an elephant's really
big<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.000> saying<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.630> really<00:02:40.960> big<00:02:41.110> as

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
big but it's saying it is really big as

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.410 
big but it's saying it is really big as

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
it could just be the word really big but

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.210 
it could just be the word really big but
I'm<00:02:43.540> gonna<00:02:43.660> say<00:02:43.840> an<00:02:43.960> elephant<00:02:44.350> because<00:02:44.440> yeah

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I'm gonna say an elephant because yeah

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.020 
I'm gonna say an elephant because yeah
as<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.610> did<00:02:45.760> it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
as we did it

search um I just tap right wrong

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.300 
search um I just tap right wrong
I<00:02:51.690> didn't<00:02:52.690> even<00:02:52.780> tap<00:02:53.440> anything<00:02:53.890> I'm<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.010> like
