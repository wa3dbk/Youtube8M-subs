00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.210 
home listen to that song I think that
spreads<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> message<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.710> me<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:07.980> Jamie

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
spreads the message that me and Jamie

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.010 
spreads the message that me and Jamie
that<00:03:08.520> me<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.030> Jake<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.330> trying<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.750> kind<00:03:09.900> of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
that me and Jake are trying to kind of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.110 
that me and Jake are trying to kind of
spread<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.290> ourselves<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.670> yeah<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:11.880> think

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
spread it ourselves I think yeah I think

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.880 
spread it ourselves I think yeah I think
not<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:12.840> people<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.350> are<00:03:13.470> gay<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.650> well

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
not just for people that are gay as well

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
not just for people that are gay as well
they're<00:03:14.040> trying<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> come<00:03:14.400> out<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.550> think<00:03:14.790> for

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
they're trying to come out I think for

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.580 
they're trying to come out I think for
people<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.240> don't<00:03:15.360> understand<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.260> think

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
people that don't understand I think

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.930 
people that don't understand I think
it's<00:03:16.680> not<00:03:16.770> necessarily<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.310> lot<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.670> people<00:03:17.850> are

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
it's not necessarily a lot of people are

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.070 
it's not necessarily a lot of people are
ignorant<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.540> think<00:03:18.810> they<00:03:18.960> don't

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
ignorant to it I just think they don't

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.240 
ignorant to it I just think they don't
understand<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.680> they've<00:03:19.770> been<00:03:19.920> brought<00:03:20.100> up

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
understand and they've been brought up

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.470 
understand and they've been brought up
around<00:03:20.580> people<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:20.850> are<00:03:20.970> very<00:03:21.120> old-school

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
around people that are very old-school

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.420 
around people that are very old-school
or<00:03:21.870> against<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.620> know<00:03:22.710> I<00:03:22.740> mean<00:03:22.830> that's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
or against it you know I mean that's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.130 
or against it you know I mean that's
what<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:23.790> struck<00:03:24.090> me<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.600> actually<00:03:24.750> if

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
what really struck me that actually if

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.320 
what really struck me that actually if
you<00:03:25.350> don't<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:25.770> anyone<00:03:26.070> who's<00:03:26.460> gay<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.060> if

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
you don't know anyone who's gay and if

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.880 
you don't know anyone who's gay and if
you<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.600> actually<00:03:27.900> experienced<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.680> is

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
you have actually experienced it this is

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.350 
you have actually experienced it this is
the<00:03:29.010> play<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.490> need<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.850> see<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.240> it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
the play that you need to see because it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000 
the play that you need to see because it
just<00:03:30.540> shows<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.020> in<00:03:31.110> such<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> real<00:03:31.500> way<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
just shows it in such a real way the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.200 
just shows it in such a real way the
conversation<00:03:32.460> that<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.610> have<00:03:32.790> with<00:03:32.820> your<00:03:33.000> mum

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
conversation that you have with your mum

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.060 
conversation that you have with your mum
when<00:03:33.390> you're<00:03:33.510> coming<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.960> I<00:03:34.380> mean<00:03:34.860> how<00:03:35.010> did

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
when you're coming out I mean how did

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.170 
when you're coming out I mean how did
you<00:03:35.280> find<00:03:35.550> acting<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:38.100> was<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.820> tough<00:03:39.000> one

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
you find acting that it was a tough one

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.090 
you find acting that it was a tough one
but<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.810> think<00:03:40.320> if<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> writing<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.070> so

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
but I I think if the writing is so

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.010 
but I I think if the writing is so
fantastic<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:41.850> Jonathan<00:03:42.120> Harvey<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.600> it's

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
fantastic but Jonathan Harvey that it's

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.810 
fantastic but Jonathan Harvey that it's
so<00:03:43.230> easy<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.920> get<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.580> emotional

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
so easy to it get on that emotional

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.500 
so easy to it get on that emotional
level<00:03:45.480> as<00:03:46.350> an<00:03:46.590> actor<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.150> completely

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
level as an actor and I just completely

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.449 
level as an actor and I just completely
believed<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.170> because<00:03:49.410> as<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:49.890> said<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.190> so

believed in it because as I said is so

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.160 
believed in it because as I said is so
true<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.000> naturalistic<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.020> was

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
true and so naturalistic that it was

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.710 
true and so naturalistic that it was
easy<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:53.190> go<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.930> yeah
