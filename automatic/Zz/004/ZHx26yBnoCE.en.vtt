00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
like the decal sheet I think that's

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.320 
like the decal sheet I think that's
probably<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.979> highlight<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.460> kit<00:05:25.669> it's<00:05:26.240> a

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
probably the highlight of the kit it's a

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.029 
probably the highlight of the kit it's a
three-in-one<00:05:26.570> kit<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.169> can<00:05:27.289> build<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.710> few

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
three-in-one kit you can build it a few

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.670 
three-in-one kit you can build it a few
different<00:05:28.370> ways<00:05:28.490> however<00:05:29.419> there<00:05:30.020> is<00:05:30.320> a<00:05:30.349> pretty

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
different ways however there is a pretty

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.230 
different ways however there is a pretty
low<00:05:30.889> parts<00:05:31.250> count<00:05:31.310> for<00:05:31.669> being<00:05:31.849> a<00:05:31.910> three<00:05:32.120> in<00:05:32.210> one

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
low parts count for being a three in one

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.839 
low parts count for being a three in one
kit<00:05:32.660> in<00:05:32.870> my<00:05:32.900> opinion<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:34.340> think<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.669> it

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
kit in my opinion and I think that it

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.740 
kit in my opinion and I think that it
definitely<00:05:35.360> shows<00:05:35.930> in<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:37.419> overall<00:05:38.419> parts

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
definitely shows in the overall parts

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.969 
definitely shows in the overall parts
that<00:05:38.870> you<00:05:38.960> get<00:05:39.139> in<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.289> kit<00:05:39.500> cuz<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.680> lot<00:05:39.889> of

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
that you get in the kit cuz a lot of

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.620 
that you get in the kit cuz a lot of
stuffs<00:05:40.220> molded<00:05:40.580> in<00:05:40.700> together<00:05:40.820> which<00:05:41.210> makes<00:05:41.419> it

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
stuffs molded in together which makes it

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.629 
stuffs molded in together which makes it
a<00:05:41.660> little<00:05:41.840> bit<00:05:41.930> harder<00:05:42.200> to<00:05:42.250> show<00:05:43.250> some<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.580> the
