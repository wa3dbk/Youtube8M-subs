00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.750
 to play against it we already have to 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.180
 grasp our standards with small 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.759
 nuances if we start to invent the 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.590
 great tactics to better everyone 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.720
 has wanted to defend Sweden doing 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.130
 thousand stories 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.009
 to better mind do nothing 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.199
 the better you just have to defend there is only 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.179
 to defend because when you do a thousand 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.369
 Swedish stories is a computer that loads 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.739
 with three days offensive rebound 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.670
 and it destroys you there that I get 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.460
 we attack that fails we want a little bit 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.070
 in this way because if not in the end more 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.409
 from more to and fro chasing 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.449
 ghosts and in the end you get it and you 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:52.149
 put the 68 but it seems to you that you're 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.149
 put 90 and attack you are penalized 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.979
 escaping blocking to treat the area and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.650
 there we have more clear as soon as they step 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.030
 zone and we see the application is very change 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.860
 where with that pib or but the player 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.710
 defended frida to continue working 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.960
 with assistance not then that not only 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.450
 not goal but not generate but here 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.110
 in coming here that what else it takes 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.369
 inside 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.259
 I'll take what he said about 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.540
 move where to push with the shoulder 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.550
 because if we get too much there they are very 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.230
 fast 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.230
 if they go back the city sand 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.880
 your favorite site what is this all 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.220
 what will be contacted and divert from 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 the place where she wants me I think that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.590
 let's beat them 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.109
 so prepared the coaching staff of the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.020
 selecting the match against his beast 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.929
 Black Sweden was one of the sensations 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.750
 of the championship but lucas mondelo víctor 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.420
 lapeña and isa sanchez prepared their 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.479
 players for a battle 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.850
 and so Spain works holding the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.909
 spectacular departure of the sisters of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.070
 bryn and the Swedish hardness the selection 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.680
 dominated the rebound remained true to their 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.860
 defensive standards and it did not go down in 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.890
 the score or the zero fouls indicated 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.539
 to sweden in the second quarter 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 they decentered the Spaniards who 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.540
 led by a great sancho lyttle the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.599
 naval the locker rooms tied little 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.350
 would play 27 minutes in a row and it would end 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.170
 the game with 17 points and 17 rebounds a 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.590
 anthological party to be happy weigh 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.590
 to fatigue 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.440
 ah 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.490
 Yesterday 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.130
 but good instagram river plate 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.290
 in the second part the selection tied 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.230
 to his rival the defense of the Spanish 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.780
 erase Sweden from a tough match 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.290
 in which caste marked trend and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.110
 I think that we are thus a 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.450
 selection that if we play physical not 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.100
 we come down on the contrary but that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.450
 we are a very temperamental team and that 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.190
 no maybe it is not the best idea 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.460
 raise a match from the point of view 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.530
 of a lot of cane much more physical the 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.080
 difference was growing at the rate of a 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.720
 Spanish team that wanted more Spain 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.270
 pass as group first and drag 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.060
 two victories for a second phase 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.170
 very important in which you will look for a good 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.130
 crossing of rooms 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.620
 mondelo was satisfied for his position 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.770
 the first thing is pride, you can win or 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 you can lose but things are many 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.660
 Sometimes it is not what happens but how it happens 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.890
 is you can lose by winning but it is 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.620
 how you lose and how you win 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.330
 and especially today as we have won and not 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.670
 is for less because the selection 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.770
 faces with more and more guarantees the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.590
 matches against slovakia montenegro and 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.110
 turkey three first level selections 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.100
 before which Spain will continue fighting 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.100
 to grow
