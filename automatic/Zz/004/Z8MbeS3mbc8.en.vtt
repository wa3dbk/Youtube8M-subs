00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.269
 and what's new youtube people like 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.369
 they are hoping that well on this occasion 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.279
 I bring you a very good way is a couple 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 of cars motorcycles helicopters and planes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.539
 Colombians for your gta san andreas 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.949
 well most of these cars are 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.170
 compiled from many pages 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.150
 Colombians that of the credits at the end 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 of the video and some I made them the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.329
 most are in hd 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.790
 well actually took like three 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.010
 weeks in gathering these vehicles this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.620
 father replaces 60 percent of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 gta san andreas cars and replaces 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 the most watched cars during the game my 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 goal was to gather them all but that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.649
 it would take too long xd and also 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.930
 I have other things to do good this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.539
 pack is very good I recommend them not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 present books or anything like that xp 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.980
 good to install the pack remember 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.989
 make a backup in case something 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.940
 it goes wrong and remember that you should not have 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.089
 cars installed in boo gta because you 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.009
 the game would be 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.109
 I warn you before they come to 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.490
 comment things like your gta stopped 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.859
 work or something 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.630
 that's why I warn you the first thing 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.490
 must do is go to the link that I will leave 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.649
 in the description of the video and it 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.929
 download the file that I will leave in the 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.000
 mediafire server once this is done 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.270
 they give you a right click on the extra option 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.270
 free 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.020
 As you can see, it takes a bit 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.280
 decompressing it as it brings 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.280
 too many vehicles 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.180
 and we will have this folder there will come 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.180
 the vehicles x 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 now we go and we open our artist img 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.030
 editor if you do not have it I will leave you the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.140
 link in the video description for 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.140
 download it xd 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.270
 Once open, we open file and 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.730
 we look for the folder of our gta san 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.160
 andreas then go to models and select 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.920
 the file called gta 3 and open it 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.290
 now we're going to close move and there are 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.510
 and we look for the folder of the cars in my 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.760
 case is on the desk good now 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.770
 we give you the control key more so that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.459
 all files are selected and you 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.459
 we give in to see 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.799
 we wait for the letters to get 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.879
 green and we give it on the disk to 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.370
 save the changes 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.980

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.079

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.079
