podium he has a couple of fourths well I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
podium he has a couple of fourths well I
think<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.680> coming<00:01:43.979> off<00:01:44.100> injury

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
think that you know coming off injury

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.039 
think that you know coming off injury
you<00:01:44.549> got<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> remember<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.360> guy<00:01:45.540> hasn't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you got to remember that this guy hasn't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
you got to remember that this guy hasn't
raced<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:47.070> time<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.700> he's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
raced in a long time and I think he's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.370 
raced in a long time and I think he's
still<00:01:48.210> trying<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.540> race<00:01:48.720> himself<00:01:49.140> into<00:01:49.350> shape

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
still trying to race himself into shape

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.929 
still trying to race himself into shape
he's<00:01:49.829> getting<00:01:50.100> good<00:01:50.220> starts<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> heat

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
he's getting good starts in the heat

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
he's getting good starts in the heat
races<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.450> things<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.649> think

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
races and things like that but I think

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
races and things like that but I think
that<00:01:53.250> he<00:01:53.909> needs<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> good<00:01:55.350> start<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that he needs to get a good start and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.380 
that he needs to get a good start and
just<00:01:56.040> try<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.250> run<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.790> see<00:01:57.060> exactly

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
just try to run up there and see exactly

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.749 
just try to run up there and see exactly
what<00:01:57.570> their<00:01:57.840> pace<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.439> knows<00:01:58.649> he<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
what their pace is he knows he can do it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
what their pace is he knows he can do it
