counter to smoke or just good paired
with<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.190> smoke<00:03:20.519> i'm<00:03:21.180> going<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.450> try<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.810> out

with the smoke i'm going to try that out

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.420 
with the smoke i'm going to try that out
yeah<00:03:22.889> so<00:03:23.630> another<00:03:24.630> thing<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:25.139> like<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.069> said<00:03:26.310> on

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
because defense on poolside is really

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:43.229 
because defense on poolside is really
really<00:03:34.109> good<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.859> was<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.010> worst
