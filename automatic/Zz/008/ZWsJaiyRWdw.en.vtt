00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:10.500
 So consider your dreams can hd1 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.400
 great sion to work with satellite 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.759
 television 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.940
 unlike the hd2 tuner it has a number 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.640
 differences that I want to tell you 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.650
 all there is hd1 Tulsk cardboard 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 quality packaging inside the packaging 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.840
 There are two instructions included 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.189
 remote control batteries 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.189
 now directly control 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.079
 the classic version of the remote on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 the central part of the console there are 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.100
 control buttons up down right 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 left and confirming hands 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.649
 there is a digital display and such for 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.010
 control at sb rewind output 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 movies as well as photo switching 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.649
 unlike hd2 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 we do not have the complete look and Rome 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:11.070
 We also have Hadamar cable about 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:16.920
 meters and directly high quality and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:21.979
 well packed force want to consider 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.979
 their tuner wounds the reverse side and 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.370
 accordingly what are you doing there once 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:33.580
 the difference of a newer version of hd2 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.880
 maybe someone bring to it because 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.930
 what exactly this prices will suit him 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.660
 so consider the back panel price 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.260
 slightly different arrangement unlike 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.910
 hd2 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.230
 but we also have antenna input 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.390
 output for connecting devices 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:03.070
 coaxial output 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:06.550
 but there is an entrance from 232 their exit 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.830
 when we them unlike hd2 you go 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.050
 tulip 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.560
 for connecting to the TV they are skating 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.050
 u hd2 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.530
 so on the back I do not see the hut 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 exit and see no output rj-45 for 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.740
 internet connection 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.270
 well , there is also a button 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.580
 on-off power cable on 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.700
 peer front panel I would say even on 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.090
 no different de lucia hd2 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.040
 visually open up at first sight 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.450
 part of us also has code for the pinch 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.070
 vesbo sang for that dollar fine 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.610
 suitable for people who use like 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:57.270
 television or tricolor ski 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:01.300
 either ntv before internet connection 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.489
 need to buy an adapter which is put 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.590
 directly to the hut and support wai 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.620
 fay but then 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.410
 lose the pleasure of watching flash 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.360
 card 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.140
 recorded with photos or movies or 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.140
 saw some 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.360
 also
