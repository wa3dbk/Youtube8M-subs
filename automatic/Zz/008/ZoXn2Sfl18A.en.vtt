00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
whole began show with a diamond rating

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.140 
whole began show with a diamond rating
of<00:00:04.730> 1101<00:00:05.730> with<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> record<00:00:06.480> at<00:00:06.629> 59<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.200> 42<00:00:08.150> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
of 1101 with the record at 59 and 42 and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.039 
of 1101 with the record at 59 and 42 and
it's<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.780> steppes<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.170> war<00:00:12.049> so

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
it's going to be on steppes of war so

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.870 
it's going to be on steppes of war so
this<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.769> random<00:00:14.009> match<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.490> me<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:14.759> like

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
this is a random match for me just like

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000 
this is a random match for me just like
it's<00:00:15.059> been<00:00:15.269> recently<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.440> am<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> red

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it's been recently and I am the red

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.620 
it's been recently and I am the red
Protoss<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.760> opponent<00:00:18.210> blue<00:00:18.690> Terran<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.270> I

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
Protoss my opponent blue Terran so I

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.509 
Protoss my opponent blue Terran so I
guess<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.320> should<00:00:22.500> show<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.800> Protoss<00:00:23.189> build

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
guess we should show my Protoss build

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.310 
guess we should show my Protoss build
since<00:00:23.880> I've<00:00:24.119> been<00:00:24.300> working<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> thanks<00:00:25.289> to

play<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.449> needs<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.840> lot<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> work<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:33.140> let's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
play which needs a lot of work and let's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.600 
play which needs a lot of work and let's
see<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> warp<00:00:35.070> gates<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
see if I can get the warp gates going a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
see if I can get the warp gates going a
little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.850> faster<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.660> whatever<00:00:39.290> also

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
little bit faster and whatever also

play as well just yeah all around i need
to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.539> Terran<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.379> Protoss<00:00:46.680> more<00:00:46.950> solid

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to get my Terran and Protoss more solid

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.819 
to get my Terran and Protoss more solid
still<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.270> my<00:00:48.390> strategy<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
still but my strategy in this one if the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
still but my strategy in this one if the
opponent<00:00:50.250> goes<00:00:50.520> by<00:00:50.820> oh<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> most<00:00:51.420> Haren<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
opponent goes by oh and most Haren do is

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.090 
opponent goes by oh and most Haren do is
to<00:00:53.250> childhood<00:00:54.000> zealot<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.660> sentry<00:00:55.230> build

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to childhood zealot and sentry build

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.760 
to childhood zealot and sentry build
that<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.460> talking<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.879> earlier

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
that I was talking about earlier

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.840 
that I was talking about earlier
obviously<00:00:58.770> against<00:00:58.980> Marauders<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> stem

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
obviously against Marauders and stem

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.990 
obviously against Marauders and stem
kiting<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> need<00:01:00.750> charge<00:01:01.020> lots

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
kiting I'm going to need charge lots

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
kiting I'm going to need charge lots
that's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.180> too<00:01:03.359> bad<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.040> right<00:01:05.309> now<00:01:05.430> it's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that's not too bad and right now it's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.010 
that's not too bad and right now it's
fairly<00:01:05.880> standard<00:01:06.330> opening<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
fairly standard opening up than to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
fairly standard opening up than to
impress<00:01:07.530> upon<00:01:07.680> either<00:01:07.920> side<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:09.030> random<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
impress upon either side I was random so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
impress upon either side I was random so
I<00:01:09.600> didn't<00:01:09.840> wall<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.200> I'll<00:01:10.530> turn<00:01:10.799> too<00:01:10.950> often

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
I didn't wall me I'll turn too often

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
I didn't wall me I'll turn too often
don't<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.549> protons<00:01:11.939> anyway<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.600> think

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
don't all protons anyway I think

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.660 
don't all protons anyway I think
sometimes<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.340> always<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:17.250> keep

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
sometimes but not always and just keep

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.020 
sometimes but not always and just keep
training<00:01:17.909> probes<00:01:18.450> lots<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> probes<00:01:22.939> when<00:01:23.939> we

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
training probes lots of probes when we

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.990 
training probes lots of probes when we
get<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.240> cyber<00:01:24.479> Corps<00:01:24.750> ASAP<00:01:25.380> once<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.400> Gateway

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
get my cyber Corps ASAP once the Gateway

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
get my cyber Corps ASAP once the Gateway
finishes<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> gives<00:01:27.840> me<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> chance<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> get

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
finishes that gives me a chance to get

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.870 
finishes that gives me a chance to get
warp<00:01:28.860> gates<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.369> away<00:01:31.340> there<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.610> get

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
warp gates right away there you go get

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.410 
warp gates right away there you go get
gas<00:01:33.030> soon<00:01:33.299> enough<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.750> warp<00:01:33.960> gates<00:01:35.420> maybe

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
gas soon enough to get warp gates maybe

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.020 
gas soon enough to get warp gates maybe
even<00:01:36.630> pick<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.020> second<00:01:37.409> gas<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:38.430> while<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
even pick up a second gas in while I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
even pick up a second gas in while I
phone<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> orbital<00:01:39.930> command<00:01:40.229> yeah

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
phone is going the orbital command yeah

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.499 
phone is going the orbital command yeah
not<00:01:41.100> too<00:01:41.280> heavy<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> infantry<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> was

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
not too heavy on the infantry but I was

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.940 
not too heavy on the infantry but I was
able<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> scout<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.259> fact<00:01:43.409> i'm<00:01:43.619> still

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
able to scout that in fact i'm still

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.359 
able to scout that in fact i'm still

want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.520> rhombus<00:01:48.079> but<00:01:49.079> yeah<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
want to be rhombus but yeah what can you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
want to be rhombus but yeah what can you
do

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280 

and<00:01:53.270> terms<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> spending<00:01:54.689> I'm<00:01:54.960> doing<00:01:55.200> pretty

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and terms of spending I'm doing pretty

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.510 
and terms of spending I'm doing pretty
well<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.680> need<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> spend<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
well I just need to spend it in the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 
well I just need to spend it in the
correct<00:01:56.729> order<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.509> optimize<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.049> early<00:01:58.590> build

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770

correct order to optimize my early build
and<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.340> getting<00:01:59.460> closer<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.600> I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and I think I'm getting closer but I

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.440 
and I think I'm getting closer but I
noticed<00:02:01.079> i<00:02:01.229> choked<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.360> should<00:02:03.360> be

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
noticed i choked here I should be

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.210 
noticed i choked here I should be

getting<00:02:05.789> or<00:02:05.939> gates<00:02:06.289> but<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.649> because<00:02:07.860> i'm

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
getting or gates but I don't because i'm

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609

you'd have a hard time actually doing

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.540 
you'd have a hard time actually doing
anything<00:03:28.319> than<00:03:28.530> me<00:03:28.590> with<00:03:28.800> only<00:03:29.040> six<00:03:29.370> Marines

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
I've more on the way and he'd have to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.259 
I've more on the way and he'd have to
travel<00:03:33.450> it's<00:03:34.410> no<00:03:34.650> good<00:03:34.800> for<00:03:34.860> him<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.370> little<00:03:36.150> too

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269

to<00:03:38.550> some<00:03:38.730> extent<00:03:39.120> but<00:03:40.080> you're<00:03:40.380> doing<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> pretty

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
to some extent but you're doing a pretty

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.940 
to some extent but you're doing a pretty
good<00:03:40.920> job<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.160> spending<00:03:42.650> concussive<00:03:43.650> shells

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
good job of spending concussive shells

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.640 
good job of spending concussive shells
and<00:03:44.850> yeah<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.330> point<00:03:45.660> start<00:03:46.230> getting<00:03:46.440> warp

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
and yeah this point start getting warp

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.840 
and yeah this point start getting warp
gates<00:03:48.739> maybe<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.830> little<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.580> slow<00:03:50.819> side

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.850 
gates maybe a little on the slow side
still<00:03:51.360> but<00:03:51.540> that's<00:03:51.690> because<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.110> had<00:03:52.380> delayed

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.720 
still but that's because I had delayed
my<00:03:53.480> researching<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.650> now<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.250> i<00:03:56.489> can

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
and yeah just gelatin centuries now why

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.220 
and yeah just gelatin centuries now why

you<00:04:09.390> get<00:04:09.540> charged<00:04:09.810> but<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.260> have<00:04:10.470> extra<00:04:10.650> gas<00:04:10.860> for

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
you get charged but I have extra gas for

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.229 
you get charged but I have extra gas for
that<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.340> I'm<00:04:11.430> going<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.640> get<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.819> relatively

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
that so I'm going to get that relatively

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.630 
that so I'm going to get that relatively
early<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:14.329> sentries<00:04:15.329> plus<00:04:16.220> Protoss<00:04:17.220> ground

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
early and sentries plus Protoss ground

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.550 
early and sentries plus Protoss ground
armor<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:19.039> guardian<00:04:20.039> shield<00:04:21.260> those<00:04:22.260> things

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
armor and guardian shield those things

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.860 
armor and guardian shield those things
together<00:04:22.910> I've<00:04:23.910> reduced<00:04:24.180> marine<00:04:24.510> damage<00:04:24.840> a

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
together I've reduced marine damage a

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.990 
together I've reduced marine damage a
lot<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.830> actually<00:04:26.100> this<00:04:26.370> puts<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.700> lot<00:04:26.970> of

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
lot so actually this puts a lot of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.900 
lot so actually this puts a lot of
pressure<00:04:27.419> on<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.780> Terran<00:04:28.289> army<00:04:28.640> if<00:04:29.640> they're

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
pressure on a Terran army if they're

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.710 
pressure on a Terran army if they're
going<00:04:30.090> by<00:04:30.390> oh<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.590> also<00:04:32.550> zealots<00:04:33.120> have<00:04:33.330> most

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
going by oh and also zealots have most

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.930 
going by oh and also zealots have most
of<00:04:33.870> their<00:04:33.990> health<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.490> health<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.850> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
of their health in health and to the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.360 
of their health in health and to the
shields<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:37.020> even<00:04:37.289> EMPs<00:04:37.710> aren't<00:04:38.010> as<00:04:38.100> good

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
shields so even EMPs aren't as good

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.980 
shields so even EMPs aren't as good
although<00:04:38.640> they'll<00:04:38.820> certainly<00:04:39.090> help<00:04:39.570> but<00:04:39.870> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
although they'll certainly help but the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.240 
although they'll certainly help but the
Terran<00:04:40.260> would<00:04:40.350> have<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.590> give<00:04:40.830> up<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.010> lot<00:04:41.130> of

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
Terran would have to give up a lot of

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.159 
Terran would have to give up a lot of
gas<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.669> so<00:04:42.419> this<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:42.600> one<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> more

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
gas for that so this is one of the more

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.350 
gas for that so this is one of the more
basic<00:04:43.680> early<00:04:44.280> counters<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.729> bio<00:04:44.910> ball<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:45.330> I

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
basic early counters to bio ball but I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.350 
basic early counters to bio ball but I
think<00:04:45.539> Protoss<00:04:45.930> neglect<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:47.210> despite<00:04:48.210> all<00:04:48.330> my

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
think Protoss neglect and despite all my

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.900 
think Protoss neglect and despite all my
other<00:04:48.630> shoddy<00:04:48.979> micro<00:04:49.979> macro<00:04:50.400> that's<00:04:50.669> still

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
other shoddy micro macro that's still

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.440 
other shoddy micro macro that's still
going<00:04:51.030> on<00:04:51.210> here<00:04:51.570> was<00:04:52.500> an<00:04:52.620> i<00:04:52.710> use<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.130> race

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
going on here was an i use to the race

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.170 
going on here was an i use to the race
yeah<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:54.570> is<00:04:54.750> something<00:04:55.140> that<00:04:55.850> really<00:04:56.850> seems

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
yeah this is something that really seems

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.820 
yeah this is something that really seems

but I scouted the bunker so I obvious
that<00:05:33.729> means<00:05:34.060> he's<00:05:34.270> planning<00:05:34.689> some<00:05:34.840> kind<00:05:34.960> of

that means he's planning some kind of

shenanigans there this is century

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.320 
shenanigans there this is century
themselves<00:05:40.449> not<00:05:40.690> so<00:05:40.960> good<00:05:41.110> for<00:05:41.139> dps<00:05:42.330> but

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
themselves not so good for dps but

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.420 
themselves not so good for dps but
they're<00:05:43.479> good<00:05:43.629> gas<00:05:43.870> dump<00:05:44.169> a<00:05:44.349> hand<00:05:44.530> if<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.340> know

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
they're good gas dump a hand if you know

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.189 
they're good gas dump a hand if you know
you<00:05:45.879> can<00:05:46.030> use<00:05:46.150> force<00:05:46.419> fields<00:05:46.750> or<00:05:46.810> whatever<00:05:47.050> but

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
you can use force fields or whatever but

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.790 
you can use force fields or whatever but
usually<00:05:47.469> just<00:05:47.620> use<00:05:47.710> guardian<00:05:48.159> shield<00:05:48.340> I<00:05:49.800> could

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
usually just use guardian shield I could

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.860 
usually just use guardian shield I could
