to another level

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.770 
to another level
yeah<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.260> think<00:00:44.790> that's<00:00:45.790> exactly<00:00:46.060> what<00:00:46.540> he<00:00:46.630> did

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
yeah I think that's exactly what he did

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.010 
yeah I think that's exactly what he did
I<00:00:48.150> think<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:51.100> know<00:00:51.190> our<00:00:51.280> last<00:00:51.520> few<00:00:51.790> days<00:00:52.020> he's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
I think you know our last few days he's

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.600 
I think you know our last few days he's
taking<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.410> bit<00:00:53.560> of<00:00:53.680> heat<00:00:53.830> and<00:00:54.070> he's<00:00:54.310> played

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
taking a bit of heat and he's played

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.420 
taking a bit of heat and he's played
well<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.890> unfortunately<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.010> puck<00:00:57.190> didn't

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
well and unfortunately the puck didn't

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.360 
well and unfortunately the puck didn't
go<00:00:57.550> in<00:00:57.700> and<00:00:57.880> tonight<00:00:58.150> you<00:00:58.720> know<00:00:58.840> I<00:00:59.590> think<00:01:00.190> he

go in and tonight you know I think he

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.990

bit<00:02:14.799> in<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> game<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.930> didn't<00:02:16.930> quite<00:02:17.170> generate

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
bit in the game we didn't quite generate

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.110 
bit in the game we didn't quite generate
what<00:02:17.830> we<00:02:17.860> wanted<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.640> didn't<00:02:19.030> make

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
what we wanted to but we didn't make

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.809 
what we wanted to but we didn't make
huge<00:02:19.450> mistakes<00:02:19.599> either<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.430> seem<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.760> a

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
huge mistakes either I just seem like a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.539 
huge mistakes either I just seem like a
bit<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.209> safe<00:02:22.420> game<00:02:22.720> early<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.709> they<00:02:24.280> got

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
bit of a safe game early on and they got

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.539 
bit of a safe game early on and they got
that<00:02:24.730> break<00:02:24.970> early<00:02:25.329> but<00:02:25.860> especially<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.160> second

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
that break early but especially a second

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.059 
that break early but especially a second
period<00:02:27.819> on<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:27.970> thought<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:29.319> did<00:02:29.440> exactly<00:02:29.620> what

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
period on I thought we did exactly what

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.979 
period on I thought we did exactly what
we<00:02:30.160> need<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.459> do<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.790> generate<00:02:31.150> tons<00:02:31.780> of

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
we need to do we generate tons of

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.850 
we need to do we generate tons of
chances<00:02:33.840> could<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.959> scored<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.230> lot<00:02:35.319> more<00:02:35.590> you

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
chances could have scored a lot more you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.550 
chances could have scored a lot more you
know<00:02:36.420> Varlamov<00:02:37.420> made<00:02:37.599> some<00:02:37.750> big<00:02:37.930> saves<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.470> had

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
know Varlamov made some big saves we had

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.780 
know Varlamov made some big saves we had
a<00:02:38.620> lot<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:38.769> parks<00:02:39.099> laying<00:02:39.340> around<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.610> net

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
a lot of parks laying around the net

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.270 
a lot of parks laying around the net
that<00:02:39.970> we<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.209> didn't<00:02:40.450> put<00:02:40.599> in<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.980> stuck

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
that we just didn't put in but we stuck

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.210 
that we just didn't put in but we stuck
to<00:02:42.519> what<00:02:42.700> we<00:02:43.000> need<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.329> do<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.829> it<00:02:44.829> was<00:02:44.950> nice<00:02:45.130> to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
to what we need to do and it was nice to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.120 
to what we need to do and it was nice to
see<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.430> pay<00:02:45.579> off

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
see it pay off

this<00:02:55.090> yeah<00:02:55.810> I'm<00:02:55.989> use<00:02:56.730> desperation<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:57.940> us

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
this yeah I'm use desperation for us

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.199 
this yeah I'm use desperation for us
obviously<00:02:59.160> we're<00:03:00.160> still<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.880> similar

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
obviously we're still in a similar

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.650 
obviously we're still in a similar
position<00:03:01.329> now<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.880> knew<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.239> was<00:03:04.389> a<00:03:04.450> big

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
position now but we knew this was a big

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.970 
position now but we knew this was a big
game<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:06.630> guys<00:03:07.630> came<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.019> play<00:03:08.170> everyone<00:03:08.620> from

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
game so guys came to play everyone from

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.479 
game so guys came to play everyone from
the<00:03:09.100> goleo<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:11.230> battled<00:03:11.620> hard<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.040> it

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
the goleo and we battled hard and it

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.410 
the goleo and we battled hard and it
would<00:03:12.609> have<00:03:12.700> been<00:03:12.819> easy<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.090> get<00:03:13.180> frustrated

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
would have been easy to get frustrated

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.900 
would have been easy to get frustrated
with<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.620> chances<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.069> we<00:03:15.220> had<00:03:15.370> not<00:03:15.579> going

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
with the chances that we had not going

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.090 
with the chances that we had not going
in<00:03:16.030> but<00:03:16.269> we<00:03:16.989> stuck<00:03:17.260> with<00:03:17.290> things<00:03:17.739> we<00:03:17.950> believe

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
in but we stuck with things we believe

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.699 
in but we stuck with things we believe
that<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.780> know<00:03:19.840> we<00:03:20.049> were<00:03:20.170> eventually<00:03:20.380> going

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
that you know we were eventually going

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.360 
that you know we were eventually going
to<00:03:20.769> get<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:21.040> break<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.849> we<00:03:22.000> did<00:03:23.370> said

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
to get that break and and we did said

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.780 
to get that break and and we did said
how<00:03:24.910> much<00:03:25.299> sorry<00:03:26.019> how<00:03:26.859> much<00:03:27.010> pressure<00:03:27.280> did<00:03:27.639> you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
how much sorry how much pressure did you

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.879 
how much sorry how much pressure did you
feel<00:03:28.090> being<00:03:28.599> down<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.170> game<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.620> being

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
feel being down in the game and being

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.089 
feel being down in the game and being
down<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.190> nothing<00:03:30.700> in<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.849> series<00:03:32.069> well<00:03:33.069> a

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
down to nothing in the series well a

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.570 
down to nothing in the series well a
little<00:03:33.250> bit<00:03:33.489> but<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.730> think<00:03:34.030> more<00:03:34.630> so

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
little bit but I think more so

little bit but I think more so

go<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.660> talked<00:04:08.900> about<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.290> style<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.709> play

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
go you talked about the style of play

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.710 
go you talked about the style of play
and<00:04:09.950> doing<00:04:10.400> what<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.730> wanted<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.270> do<00:04:11.450> talk

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
and doing what you wanted to do talk

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.660 
and doing what you wanted to do talk
about<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:12.110> importance<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.830> that<00:04:13.160> going

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
about the importance of that going

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.280 
about the importance of that going
forward<00:04:14.030> particularly<00:04:14.570> this<00:04:14.900> looming

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
forward particularly this looming

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.220 
forward particularly this looming
potentially<00:04:15.860> zhalong<00:04:16.160> seriously<00:04:16.989> yeah<00:04:17.989> it's

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
potentially zhalong seriously yeah it's

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.220 
potentially zhalong seriously yeah it's
I<00:04:18.650> mean<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:19.549> know<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.269> cliche<00:04:20.660> but<00:04:20.840> game<00:04:21.049> by

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
I mean I know it's a cliche but game by

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.380 
I mean I know it's a cliche but game by
game<00:04:23.080> couldn't<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.230> more<00:04:25.150> proper<00:04:26.150> for<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
game couldn't be more proper for the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.490 
game couldn't be more proper for the
playoffs<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.669> think<00:04:28.970> over<00:04:29.330> less<00:04:29.540> three

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
playoffs and I think over less three

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.050 
playoffs and I think over less three
games<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.950> we<00:04:31.040> played<00:04:31.310> we've<00:04:31.520> done<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.730> lot<00:04:31.880> of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
games that we played we've done a lot of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.420 
games that we played we've done a lot of
good<00:04:32.210> things<00:04:32.410> we<00:04:33.410> made<00:04:33.590> some<00:04:33.800> mistakes<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.370> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
good things we made some mistakes in the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.370 
good things we made some mistakes in the
first<00:04:34.580> couple<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.450> hurt<00:04:35.660> us<00:04:35.690> but<00:04:36.080> for

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
first couple that that hurt us but for

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.480 
first couple that that hurt us but for
the<00:04:36.470> most<00:04:36.650> part<00:04:36.890> we<00:04:36.980> did<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.130> lot<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.370> good

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
the most part we did a lot of good

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.480 
the most part we did a lot of good
things<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:38.500> we<00:04:39.500> stuck<00:04:39.740> with<00:04:39.770> things<00:04:40.160> here

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
things and we stuck with things here

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
know even a game like this it's it's a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.700 
know even a game like this it's it's a
good<00:04:50.419> lesson<00:04:50.780> for<00:04:50.810> us<00:04:51.020> as<00:04:51.169> well<00:04:51.350> with<00:04:51.560> the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
good lesson for us as well with the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.930 
good lesson for us as well with the
amount<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.919> chances<00:04:52.250> we<00:04:52.340> had<00:04:52.490> like<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:52.700> said

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
amount of chances we had like I said

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.460 
amount of chances we had like I said
with<00:04:53.090> it<00:04:53.180> easy<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.450> get<00:04:53.540> frustrated<00:04:53.750> we<00:04:54.169> didn't

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
with it easy to get frustrated we didn't

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.469 
with it easy to get frustrated we didn't
and<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:55.520> know<00:04:55.610> we've<00:04:55.820> seen<00:04:56.150> some<00:04:56.210> good

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
and you know we've seen some good

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.659 
and you know we've seen some good
results<00:04:56.600> there<00:04:57.020> so<00:04:57.260> we've<00:04:57.410> got<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.620> no<00:04:58.310> one<00:04:58.550> in

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
results there so we've got a no one in

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.360 
results there so we've got a no one in
the<00:04:58.760> game<00:04:58.910> for<00:04:59.180> here<00:04:59.450> that<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.919> know<00:05:01.040> if<00:05:01.100> we<00:05:01.280> do

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
the game for here that you know if we do

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.290 
the game for here that you know if we do
the<00:05:01.490> right<00:05:01.669> things<00:05:01.880> we're<00:05:02.060> going<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.240> be

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
the right things we're going to be

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.010 
the right things we're going to be
rewarded<00:05:04.090> so<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.300> second<00:05:05.630> period<00:05:05.780> there

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
rewarded so the second period there

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.350 
rewarded so the second period there
seemed<00:05:06.320> like<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> big<00:05:06.680> turning<00:05:07.010> point<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:08.210> guys

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
seemed like a big turning point you guys

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.520 
seemed like a big turning point you guys
basically<00:05:08.750> played<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> complete<00:05:09.320> period

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
basically played a complete period

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.659 
basically played a complete period
probably<00:05:10.040> for<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.190> first<00:05:10.220> time<00:05:10.520> in<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
probably for the first time in the

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:11.800 
probably for the first time in the
series<00:05:10.820> do<00:05:11.150> you<00:05:11.210> feel<00:05:11.390> like<00:05:11.479> that<00:05:11.660> is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
series do you feel like that is

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.380 
series do you feel like that is
something<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.140> build<00:05:12.260> on<00:05:12.580> yeah<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.850> mean<00:05:14.120> I

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
something to build on yeah I mean I

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.000 
something to build on yeah I mean I
thought<00:05:14.780> we<00:05:14.840> played<00:05:15.140> a<00:05:15.169> lot<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.380> good<00:05:15.560> periods

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
thought we played a lot of good periods

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.659 
thought we played a lot of good periods
over<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.430> past<00:05:16.910> few<00:05:17.090> games<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:19.430> didn't

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
over the past few games but we didn't

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.300 
over the past few games but we didn't
give<00:05:19.760> up<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:20.030> lot<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.570> far<00:05:20.600> as<00:05:21.070> defensively<00:05:22.070> we

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
give up a lot as far as defensively we

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.800 
give up a lot as far as defensively we
we<00:05:22.640> played<00:05:22.910> pretty<00:05:23.150> tight<00:05:23.390> and<00:05:23.570> that's<00:05:23.690> what

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
we played pretty tight and that's what

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.810 
we played pretty tight and that's what
we<00:05:23.870> want<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.169> do<00:05:24.260> we<00:05:24.470> want<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.740> get<00:05:24.919> the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
we want to do we want to get the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.850 
we want to do we want to get the
offensive<00:05:26.300> opportunities<00:05:26.870> we<00:05:26.990> had<00:05:27.200> but<00:05:27.470> limit

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
offensive opportunities we had but limit

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.820 
offensive opportunities we had but limit
our<00:05:27.950> mistakes<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:29.630> think<00:05:30.380> you're<00:05:30.500> right<00:05:30.680> we

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
our mistakes and I think you're right we

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.690 
our mistakes and I think you're right we
did<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:31.010> good<00:05:31.130> job<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.490> that

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700
