00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
praying my pass blocking can hold up

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.710 
praying my pass blocking can hold up
lucky<00:01:27.640> for<00:01:27.789> me<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.060> Huskies<00:01:28.360> don't<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.570> much

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
lucky for me the Huskies don't have much

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.889 
lucky for me the Huskies don't have much
of<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.899> pass<00:01:29.110> rush<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:31.030> an<00:01:31.149> extra<00:01:31.420> two<00:01:31.600> steps

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
of a pass rush take an extra two steps

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.510 
of a pass rush take an extra two steps
back<00:01:32.170> reason<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.799> do<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.250> buy<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.399> little

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
back reason I do that is to buy a little

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.279 
back reason I do that is to buy a little
extra<00:01:33.700> time<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.270> can't<00:01:34.539> see<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.869> pass<00:01:35.049> rush

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
extra time so I can't see the pass rush

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.770 
extra time so I can't see the pass rush
I<00:01:35.439> got<00:01:35.560> my<00:01:35.649> eyes<00:01:35.799> on<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:36.189> receiver<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.750> you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I got my eyes on the receiver so you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.210 
I got my eyes on the receiver so you
might<00:01:37.990> say<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.170> got<00:01:38.350> two<00:01:38.500> receivers<00:01:38.920> coming

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
might say I got two receivers coming

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.740 
might say I got two receivers coming
open<00:01:39.310> underneath<00:01:39.610> but<00:01:39.939> once<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.390> throw<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
open underneath but once you throw the

let's<00:06:37.319> look<00:06:37.410> at<00:06:37.500> the<00:06:37.590> safeties<00:06:37.889> actually

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
let's look at the safeties actually

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.879 
let's look at the safeties actually
bailout<00:06:38.810> looks<00:06:39.810> like<00:06:39.990> Stanford<00:06:40.470> is<00:06:40.590> only

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
bailout looks like Stanford is only

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.610

bringing<00:06:41.310> five<00:06:41.849> here<00:06:42.539> I<00:06:42.690> expected<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.470> bigger

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
bringing five here I expected a bigger

bringing five here I expected a bigger
blitz<00:06:43.949> but<00:06:44.580> because<00:06:44.849> they<00:06:44.940> brought<00:06:45.120> the

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
blitz but because they brought the

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.339 
blitz but because they brought the
safeties<00:06:45.539> so<00:06:45.569> close<00:06:45.840> to<00:06:46.020> the<00:06:46.080> line<00:06:46.229> of

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
safeties so close to the line of

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.080 
safeties so close to the line of
