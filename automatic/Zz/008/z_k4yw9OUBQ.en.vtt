set a timer okay so turn this thing up
on<00:02:54.810> high<00:02:55.260> until<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.550> starts<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> steam<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
on high until it starts to steam and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.320 
on high until it starts to steam and
from<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.310> point<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.820> you're<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.210> wait

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
from that point on you're going to wait

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.390 
from that point on you're going to wait
15<00:03:01.050> minutes<00:03:01.230> for<00:03:01.410> every<00:03:01.710> 15<00:03:02.070> pounds<00:03:02.340> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
15 minutes for every 15 pounds of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.700 
15 minutes for every 15 pounds of
pressure<00:03:02.460> this<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.540> 10-pound<00:03:04.110> pressure<00:03:04.380> so

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
pressure this is a 10-pound pressure so

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.980 
pressure this is a 10-pound pressure so
I'm<00:03:04.800> gonna<00:03:04.950> wait<00:03:05.040> 30<00:03:05.310> minutes<00:03:05.580> from<00:03:06.420> about

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
I'm gonna wait 30 minutes from about

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.650 
I'm gonna wait 30 minutes from about
five<00:03:07.230> after<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:08.340> when<00:03:09.210> it's<00:03:09.330> going<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.510> start

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
five after is when it's going to start

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.240 
five after is when it's going to start
spearing<00:03:10.050> now<00:03:10.140> once<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.530> starts<00:03:10.770> kicking<00:03:11.010> out

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
spearing now once it starts kicking out

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.730 
spearing now once it starts kicking out
you<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.610> need<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.120> super<00:03:12.420> high<00:03:12.750> so

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
you don't need it to be super high so

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.640 
you don't need it to be super high so
I'll<00:03:14.220> turn<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.670> down<00:03:14.960> low<00:03:15.960> enough<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.350> keep<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
I'll turn it down low enough to keep the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.030 
I'll turn it down low enough to keep the
steam<00:03:16.890> coming<00:03:17.160> out<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:18.440> at<00:03:19.440> 30<00:03:19.680> minutes<00:03:19.890> you

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
steam coming out and at 30 minutes you

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
steam coming out and at 30 minutes you
shut<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.310> off<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:22.190> want<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.430> down

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.960 

and<00:03:28.540> I'm<00:03:28.690> loved<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:30.430> way<00:03:30.550> this<00:03:30.790> will

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
and I'm loved and that way this will

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.290 
and I'm loved and that way this will
still<00:03:31.660> keep<00:03:31.959> above<00:03:32.380> pressure<00:03:32.970> long<00:03:33.970> as<00:03:34.150> things

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
still keep above pressure long as things

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.760 
still keep above pressure long as things
coming<00:03:34.690> out<00:03:34.720> your<00:03:34.900> over<00:03:35.140> pressure<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:35.680> you

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
coming out your over pressure but you

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.260 
coming out your over pressure but you
don't<00:03:35.920> need<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.100> overcook<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:36.819> waste<00:03:37.120> all

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
don't need to overcook it and waste all

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.740 
don't need to overcook it and waste all
your<00:03:37.420> water<00:03:38.040> okay<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.280> long<00:03:40.030> gets<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.510> amount

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
your water okay so long gets the amount

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.420 
your water okay so long gets the amount
like<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.110> you're<00:03:42.069> good<00:03:43.440> okay<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.709> half<00:03:45.250> hour

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
like that you're good okay so half hour

00:03:45.430 --> 00:04:11.910 
like that you're good okay so half hour
later<00:03:52.980> now<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.040> have<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.520> leave

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.110 

you<00:04:12.920> will<00:04:13.070> not<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.400> able<00:04:13.460> to<00:04:13.550> get<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.820> submit

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
you will not be able to get to submit

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.910 
you will not be able to get to submit
off<00:04:14.240> until<00:04:14.630> all<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.870> pressure<00:04:15.140> goes<00:04:15.470> down

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
off until all that pressure goes down

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.900 
off until all that pressure goes down
enough<00:04:16.580> there<00:04:16.850> they<00:04:17.000> lock<00:04:18.220> on<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.430> handle<00:04:19.760> so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
enough there they lock on the handle so

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.170 
enough there they lock on the handle so
when<00:04:20.060> that<00:04:20.239> pops<00:04:20.510> down<00:04:21.040> now<00:04:22.040> we<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.340> relieved

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
when that pops down now we have relieved

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.540 
when that pops down now we have relieved
enough<00:04:23.450> pressure<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.870> get<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.110> lid<00:04:24.260> off<00:04:24.290> so<00:04:24.680> at

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
enough pressure to get the lid off so at

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.630 
enough pressure to get the lid off so at
this<00:04:25.760> point<00:04:26.000> I'll<00:04:26.210> take<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.540> off<00:04:27.460> now<00:04:28.460> you're

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
this point I'll take this off now you're

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.890 
this point I'll take this off now you're
going<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.820> let<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.120> cool<00:04:29.360> off<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:29.720> about

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
going to let this cool off for about

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.340 
going to let this cool off for about
half<00:04:30.230> an<00:04:30.440> hour<00:04:31.420> two<00:04:32.420> reasons<00:04:32.870> one<00:04:33.170> you<00:04:33.200> don't

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
half an hour two reasons one you don't

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.730 
half an hour two reasons one you don't
want<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.590> get<00:04:33.680> burned<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.880> other<00:04:35.740> one

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
want to get burned and the other one

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.950 
want to get burned and the other one
side<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:37.070> these<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.930> paper<00:04:40.330> wet<00:04:41.330> paper<00:04:41.540> tears

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
side of these is paper wet paper tears

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.750 
side of these is paper wet paper tears
you<00:04:42.710> don't<00:04:42.860> want<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.070> tear<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.280> hole<00:04:43.430> in<00:04:43.610> it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
you don't want to tear a hole in it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.240 
you don't want to tear a hole in it
because<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.150> just<00:04:44.180> sterilized<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:46.100> I'm

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
because you just sterilized it so I'm

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.100 
because you just sterilized it so I'm
going<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.400> let<00:04:46.490> just<00:04:46.670> cool<00:04:46.970> off<00:04:47.000> before<00:04:47.450> I<00:04:47.720> pull

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
going to let just cool off before I pull

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.210 
going to let just cool off before I pull
it<00:04:48.230> out<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.590> show<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.100> rest

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.100 

okay<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:57.280> as<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:57.759> can<00:04:58.060> see<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.389> indicator<00:04:58.840> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
okay so as you can see the indicator to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.400 
okay so as you can see the indicator to
turn<00:04:59.740> from<00:04:59.949> light<00:05:00.220> blue<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:02.550> black<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:05.229> that

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
turn from light blue to black so that

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.960 
turn from light blue to black so that
indicates<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:06.009> we<00:05:06.280> got<00:05:06.430> enough<00:05:06.669> heat<00:05:06.850> and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
indicates that we got enough heat and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.650 
indicates that we got enough heat and
pressure<00:05:08.729> now<00:05:09.729> I'm<00:05:09.850> glad<00:05:10.000> you're<00:05:10.210> my<00:05:10.330> ribs

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
pressure now I'm glad you're my ribs

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.469 
pressure now I'm glad you're my ribs
because<00:05:10.900> even<00:05:11.740> if<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.130> say<00:05:12.580> oh<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.940> don't<00:05:13.060> you

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
because even if you say oh I don't you

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.010 
because even if you say oh I don't you
still<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:13.870> use<00:05:14.169> disposable<00:05:15.009> great<00:05:16.000> do<00:05:16.750> whatever

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
still I use disposable great do whatever

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.600 
still I use disposable great do whatever
you<00:05:17.199> want

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
you want

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.020 
you want
some<00:05:18.610> people<00:05:18.910> use<00:05:19.150> disposable<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:21.009> user<00:05:21.910> a

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
some people use disposable and a user a

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.300 
some people use disposable and a user a
usable<00:05:22.479> grip<00:05:22.750> which<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.800> little<00:05:24.130> bit

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
usable grip which is a little bit

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.120 
usable grip which is a little bit
pointless<00:05:24.910> because<00:05:25.440> these<00:05:26.440> are<00:05:26.680> touched<00:05:26.949> with

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
pointless because these are touched with

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.180 
pointless because these are touched with
dirty<00:05:27.430> hands<00:05:27.669> all<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.000> time<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.979> you're<00:05:29.979> going

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
dirty hands all the time so you're going

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.770 
dirty hands all the time so you're going
to<00:05:30.250> need<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.550> clean<00:05:30.880> these<00:05:31.030> anyway<00:05:31.389> so<00:05:31.449> if<00:05:31.690> you

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
to need to clean these anyway so if you

for Santa sterilizing sanitizing a
couple<00:06:15.190> ounces<00:06:15.250> is<00:06:15.610> two<00:06:15.729> again<00:06:15.940> on<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.120> water

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
couple ounces is two again on the water

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.409 
couple ounces is two again on the water
you<00:06:17.380> pour<00:06:17.740> that<00:06:17.889> solution<00:06:18.430> into<00:06:19.060> some<00:06:19.330> of

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
you pour that solution into some of

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.570 
you pour that solution into some of
these<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:20.409> you<00:06:20.680> can<00:06:20.860> wipe<00:06:21.039> down<00:06:21.250> everything

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
these and you can wipe down everything

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.610 
these and you can wipe down everything
so<00:06:22.180> if<00:06:22.300> it's<00:06:22.479> not<00:06:23.250> anything<00:06:24.250> that's<00:06:24.400> not<00:06:24.729> a

sterilizer

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
sterilizer

sterilizer
one<00:06:34.120> way<00:06:34.240> or<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.389> other<00:06:34.440> you<00:06:35.440> have<00:06:35.620> to<00:06:35.740> kill

one way or the other you have to kill

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.740 
one way or the other you have to kill
everything<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.960> tells<00:06:38.289> you<00:06:38.530> to<00:06:39.690> sanitize<00:06:40.690> it

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
everything this tells you to sanitize it

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.589 
everything this tells you to sanitize it
sterilize<00:06:41.169> it<00:06:41.320> and<00:06:41.470> then<00:06:41.949> store<00:06:42.340> it<00:06:42.599> because

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
sterilize it and then store it because

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.580 
sterilize it and then store it because
now<00:06:43.810> you<00:06:43.870> can't<00:06:44.380> touch<00:06:44.560> it<00:06:44.620> so<00:06:44.979> it's<00:06:45.099> open<00:06:46.590> if

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
now you can't touch it so it's open if

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.290 
now you can't touch it so it's open if
you<00:06:47.740> don't<00:06:47.979> have<00:06:48.159> these<00:06:48.340> like<00:06:48.639> I<00:06:48.669> said<00:06:48.760> wrap

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
you don't have these like I said wrap

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.050 
you don't have these like I said wrap
them<00:06:49.479> up<00:06:49.599> and<00:06:50.130> then<00:06:51.130> use<00:06:51.310> the<00:06:51.430> indicator<00:06:51.669> tape

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
them up and then use the indicator tape

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.469 
them up and then use the indicator tape
you<00:06:53.050> another<00:06:53.949> thing<00:06:54.190> you<00:06:54.370> don't<00:06:54.610> have<00:06:55.270> these

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
you another thing you don't have these

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:00.000 
you another thing you don't have these
sealing<00:06:56.050> them<00:06:56.169> off<00:06:56.349> and<00:06:57.070> use<00:06:57.400> a<00:06:59.010> distilled

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
sealing them off and use a distilled

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.570 
sealing them off and use a distilled
water<00:07:00.190> because<00:07:00.729> well<00:07:01.800> tap<00:07:02.800> water<00:07:03.010> has<00:07:03.280> a<00:07:03.340> lot

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
water because well tap water has a lot

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.010 
water because well tap water has a lot
of<00:07:03.729> minerals<00:07:03.880> in<00:07:04.150> it<00:07:04.240> and<00:07:04.450> those<00:07:04.570> minerals

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
of minerals in it and those minerals

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.810 
of minerals in it and those minerals
will<00:07:05.200> bake<00:07:05.440> on<00:07:05.620> to<00:07:05.889> your<00:07:06.039> stainless<00:07:06.400> steel<00:07:06.639> and

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
will bake on to your stainless steel and

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.290 
will bake on to your stainless steel and
that<00:07:06.880> will<00:07:07.060> look

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
that will look

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.129 
that will look
nasty<00:07:07.720> so<00:07:08.190> use<00:07:09.190> distilled<00:07:09.520> water<00:07:09.639> and<00:07:10.139> wrap

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139 
nasty so use distilled water and wrap

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:32.390 
nasty so use distilled water and wrap
yourself<00:07:11.349> up

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400
