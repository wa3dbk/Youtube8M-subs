stretch and now we're going to go up to
the<00:06:20.139> e<00:06:20.639> which<00:06:21.639> is<00:06:21.819> just<00:06:22.089> like<00:06:22.240> this<00:06:22.449> one<00:06:22.719> only

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
the e which is just like this one only

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.180 
the e which is just like this one only
up<00:06:23.529> a<00:06:23.589> whole<00:06:24.129> step

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.420 

I'm<00:06:30.190> sliding<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:34.000> then<00:06:34.180> I'm<00:06:34.300> just<00:06:34.330> kind<00:06:34.720> of

end<00:06:41.050> it<00:06:41.170> like<00:06:41.290> that<00:06:48.180> so<00:06:49.180> the<00:06:50.050> whole<00:06:50.230> thing<00:06:50.500> from

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
end it like that so the whole thing from

00:06:50.710 --> 00:07:08.540 
end it like that so the whole thing from
the<00:06:50.770> top

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.070 

so<00:07:09.550> once<00:07:09.730> again<00:07:09.880> this<00:07:10.240> has<00:07:10.300> been<00:07:10.390> Jeffrey<00:07:10.870> Paul

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080
