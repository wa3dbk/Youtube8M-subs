00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
use the magic contrast and mixed it with

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.459 
use the magic contrast and mixed it with
something<00:00:42.000> else<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.930> want<00:00:43.079> me<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> make<00:00:43.440> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
think have 13 or 14 Pearson's they're

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.080 
think have 13 or 14 Pearson's they're
not<00:01:34.710> alleged<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.220> some<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> burgers<00:01:35.880> like

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
not alleged in some of the burgers like

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.190 
not alleged in some of the burgers like
low<00:01:36.360> ponds<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:38.430> trend<00:01:39.240> renews<00:01:39.540> best<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.960> can

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
low ponds and a trend renews best I can

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
low ponds and a trend renews best I can
if<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.890> trained<00:01:41.130> pitbull<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> video

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
if not all trained pitbull in the video

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.490 
if not all trained pitbull in the video
of<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:43.500> Pearson's<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
of my Pearson's and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.080 
of my Pearson's and
so<00:01:45.560> basically<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.160> this<00:01:46.340> year<00:01:46.750> my<00:01:48.400> my<00:01:49.400> left<00:01:49.790> ear

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
so basically on this year my my left ear

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.370 
so basically on this year my my left ear
to<00:01:50.450> use<00:01:50.600> hey<00:01:51.470> hey<00:01:52.160> I<00:01:52.490> don't<00:01:53.030> know<00:01:53.120> and
