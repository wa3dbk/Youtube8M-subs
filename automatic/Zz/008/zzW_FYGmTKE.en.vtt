00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
choice I can see it's maturing very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.929

nicely it's a very fluid operating
system<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> love<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.590> live<00:01:22.770> tiles<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.610> love

how<00:01:24.090> sleek<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.049> solve<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:26.159> makes<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
how sleek and solve it just makes you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.710 
how sleek and solve it just makes you
want<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> touch<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
want to touch it all the time if that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.710 
want to touch it all the time if that
makes<00:01:27.900> sense<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:30.420> thing<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
makes sense I think the only thing it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.830 
makes sense I think the only thing it
was<00:01:30.840> lacking<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.680> way<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
was lacking in was the way that the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.880 
was lacking in was the way that the
marketplace<00:01:33.840> worked<00:01:34.170> where<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> were<00:01:34.860> going

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
marketplace worked where you were going

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
marketplace worked where you were going
to<00:01:35.509> purchase<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.810> download<00:01:37.650> free<00:01:37.979> apps<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to purchase or download free apps the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
to purchase or download free apps the
way<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:39.990> organized<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.829> didn't<00:01:41.070> work

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
way that was organized still didn't work

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.100 
way that was organized still didn't work
with<00:01:41.460> me<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> search<00:01:42.060> feature<00:01:42.420> didn't<00:01:42.869> always

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
with me the search feature didn't always

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
with me the search feature didn't always
turn<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> results<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.820> was

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
turn out the results that I was

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.210 
turn out the results that I was
expecting<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.530> were<00:01:46.680> some<00:01:46.979> apps

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
expecting and there were some apps

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.389 
expecting and there were some apps
missing<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.409> using<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
missing that I really do like using so

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
missing that I really do like using so
when<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> comes<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.530> maybe<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.600> latter<00:01:54.840> part

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
when it comes to maybe the latter part

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.459 
when it comes to maybe the latter part
of<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.380> year<00:01:55.649> maybe<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.640> 2013<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.380> as

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
of this year maybe into 2013 I think as

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230 
of this year maybe into 2013 I think as
long<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.860> they've<00:01:59.040> got<00:01:59.070> developers<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.939> board

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
long as they've got developers on board

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.249 
long as they've got developers on board
and<00:02:01.009> they've<00:02:02.009> managed<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.600> sort<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> bring

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and they've managed to sort of bring

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.740 
and they've managed to sort of bring
more<00:02:04.619> apps<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.159> platform<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> maybe<00:02:06.060> just

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
more apps to the platform and maybe just

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.600 
more apps to the platform and maybe just
introduce<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.409> few<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.770> features<00:02:08.039> over<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
introduce a few more features over the
