hi my name is hunter Waldron and I work

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.950 
hi my name is hunter Waldron and I work
here<00:00:17.460> at<00:00:17.580> k2<00:00:17.789> snowboarding<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
here at k2 snowboarding and I'm going to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.470 
here at k2 snowboarding and I'm going to
talk<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.410> our<00:00:19.529> new<00:00:20.279> lean<00:00:20.760> binding

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
talk to you about our new lean binding

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.859 
talk to you about our new lean binding
with<00:00:21.630> its<00:00:21.840> tripod<00:00:22.260> chassis<00:00:23.070> technology<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
with its tripod chassis technology and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
with its tripod chassis technology and
the<00:00:25.500> development<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> spining<00:00:26.460> really

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the development of the spining really

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.300 
the development of the spining really
began<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.650> talked<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> lot<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.130> our

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
began when we talked to a lot of our

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.970 
began when we talked to a lot of our
pros<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.119> our<00:00:30.210> riders<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> ambassadors<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
pros and our riders and ambassadors and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.459 
pros and our riders and ambassadors and
people<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> company<00:00:33.180> about<00:00:33.410> kind<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
people about the company about kind of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.959 
people about the company about kind of
the<00:00:34.590> fundamental<00:00:34.800> contradiction<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the fundamental contradiction of a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.430 
the fundamental contradiction of a
binding<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.570> supposed<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> hold<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.380> down

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
binding it's supposed to hold you down

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
binding it's supposed to hold you down
and<00:00:37.649> hold<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.700> also<00:00:39.030> give<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> some

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and hold you in but also give you some

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
and hold you in but also give you some
freedom<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> move<00:00:40.440> around<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> can

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
freedom to move around that you can

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.950 
freedom to move around that you can
pressure<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:42.030> board<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.480> different<00:00:42.809> ways

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
pressure your board in different ways

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.410 
pressure your board in different ways
draw<00:00:43.920> different<00:00:44.160> lines<00:00:44.550> down<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> mountain

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
draw different lines down the mountain

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.840 
draw different lines down the mountain
so<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.610> genesis<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so that was really the the genesis of it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
so that was really the the genesis of it
is<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.180> try<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.450> look<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.989> contradiction

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
is to try and look at that contradiction

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
is to try and look at that contradiction
and<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.789> make<00:00:50.969> some<00:00:51.149> steps

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and see if we can make some steps

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
and see if we can make some steps
towards<00:00:51.930> finding<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> perfect<00:00:53.190> balance

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
towards finding the perfect balance

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.720 
towards finding the perfect balance
there<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.079> approach<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there so the way we approach this this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
there so the way we approach this this
balance<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.660> trying<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.079> find<00:00:58.320> some<00:00:58.530> balance

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
balance or trying to find some balance

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.939 
balance or trying to find some balance
was<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.840> how<00:01:01.230> naturally

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
was to really think about how naturally

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.700 
was to really think about how naturally
your<00:01:02.100> foot<00:01:02.340> flexes<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.049> mimic<00:01:04.290> how

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
your foot flexes and if we can mimic how

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.969 
your foot flexes and if we can mimic how
your<00:01:04.920> foot<00:01:05.189> moves<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.880> flexes<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
your foot moves and flexes and and

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
your foot moves and flexes and and
interacts<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:09.060> might<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
interacts then we might have that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.200 
interacts then we might have that
balance<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.979> binding<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> makes<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.970> feel

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
balance of a binding that makes you feel

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.539 
balance of a binding that makes you feel
free<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.990> also<00:01:13.020> does<00:01:13.530> its<00:01:13.710> basic<00:01:14.070> function<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
free but also does its basic function of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
free but also does its basic function of
hold<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> board

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
hold you to the board

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.630 
hold you to the board
there<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.710> three<00:01:16.830> points<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> contact

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
there are really three points of contact

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
there are really three points of contact
that<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.509> foot<00:01:18.780> makes<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:20.040> you're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that your foot makes when you're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.450 
that your foot makes when you're
standing<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.790> running<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.439> snowboarding<00:01:22.460> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
standing or running or snowboarding and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
standing or running or snowboarding and
so<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.030> use<00:01:24.270> those<00:01:24.570> three<00:01:24.810> points<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.350> our

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
so we use those three points as our

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
so we use those three points as our
starting<00:01:25.920> point<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.430> they're<00:01:27.270> asymmetrical

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
starting point and they're asymmetrical

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
starting point and they're asymmetrical
the<00:01:28.500> human<00:01:28.770> foot<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.250> pretty<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.880> not

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the human foot is not pretty it's not

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.109 
the human foot is not pretty it's not
even<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.159> place<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:32.759> power

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
even so we we place these power

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.140 
even so we we place these power
transition<00:01:33.780> mission<00:01:34.290> pods<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> locations

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
transition mission pods in the locations

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.050 
transition mission pods in the locations
of<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.509> three<00:01:36.869> major<00:01:37.110> pressure<00:01:38.100> contacts

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
of those three major pressure contacts

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
of those three major pressure contacts
and<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.930> where<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:40.350> transmitting<00:01:40.740> all

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
and that's where you're transmitting all

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
and that's where you're transmitting all
your<00:01:41.310> power<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:42.060> your<00:01:42.210> foot<00:01:42.479> through<00:01:42.990> your

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
your power from your foot through your

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
your power from your foot through your
boot<00:01:43.380> through<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.979> binding<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.670> into

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
boot through your binding and out into

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.840 
boot through your binding and out into
your<00:01:45.299> board<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> key<00:01:47.130> features<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
your board so one of the key features of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.780 
your board so one of the key features of
the<00:01:48.119> tripod<00:01:48.600> chassis<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
the tripod chassis is that it's

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.530 
the tripod chassis is that it's
biomechanically<00:01:50.790> correct<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
biomechanically correct that's a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.289 
biomechanically correct that's a
mouthful<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.430> intricate<00:01:54.210> way

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
mouthful but it's just an intricate way

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
mouthful but it's just an intricate way
of<00:01:54.450> saying<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.829> foot

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of saying that this is the way your foot

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
of saying that this is the way your foot
works<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.790> that's<00:01:56.909> why<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.049> end<00:01:58.200> we've

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
works and that's why in the end we've

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
works and that's why in the end we've
got<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> binding<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.070> flexes<00:01:59.700> with<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.329> foot

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
got a binding that flexes with your foot

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.920 
got a binding that flexes with your foot
and<00:02:00.869> almost<00:02:01.590> disappears<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.729> respect<00:02:03.210> so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
and how it transmits power the next step
was<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> mimic<00:02:11.069> how<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> human<00:02:11.910> foot<00:02:12.150> flexes

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
was to mimic how the human foot flexes

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.220 
was to mimic how the human foot flexes
and<00:02:12.959> how

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230

way<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> human<00:02:30.269> foot<00:02:30.510> does<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.769> have

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
way the human foot does so that you have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.039 
way the human foot does so that you have
a<00:02:31.950> perfect<00:02:32.489> transmission<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.180> power<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:33.930> you

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
a perfect transmission of power but you

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.890 
a perfect transmission of power but you
also<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.620> some<00:02:34.920> movement<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:36.120> mimics<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
also have some movement that mimics the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.530 
also have some movement that mimics the
human<00:02:37.260> foot<00:02:37.560> movement<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.940> find<00:02:39.299> new

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
human foot movement so you can find new

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.720 
human foot movement so you can find new
ways<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.200> reach<00:02:40.829> out<00:02:41.099> on<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:41.459> board<00:02:41.640> and

ways to reach out on your board and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.449 
ways to reach out on your board and
pressure<00:02:42.060> your<00:02:42.329> edge<00:02:42.510> farther<00:02:43.049> or<00:02:43.650> even<00:02:44.190> stay
