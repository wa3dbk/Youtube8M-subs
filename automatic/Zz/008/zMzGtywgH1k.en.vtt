00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
wrong was after the Ron and measure set

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.150 
wrong was after the Ron and measure set
us<00:00:31.230> 15<00:00:32.070> 16<00:00:32.910> well<00:00:33.480> after<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> seventeenth<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
us 15 16 well after the seventeenth and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.319 
us 15 16 well after the seventeenth and
eighteenth<00:00:35.219> measure<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> lento<00:00:37.559> portion

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
eighteenth measure with a lento portion

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
eighteenth measure with a lento portion
we're<00:00:39.329> supposed<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.719> back<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> tempo

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
we're supposed to go back into a tempo

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.819 
we're supposed to go back into a tempo
and<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.010> think<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.399> completely<00:00:41.879> lost<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.170> quite

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and I think I completely lost that quite

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.350 
and I think I completely lost that quite
frankly<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.960> suggest<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.649> do

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
frankly and so what I suggest you do

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.610 
frankly and so what I suggest you do
which<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.480> did<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.960> myself<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:51.590> when<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
which I did do myself is that when you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.410 
which I did do myself is that when you
get<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.230> last<00:00:55.760> measure<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.300> says

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
get to the last measure where it says

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.029 
get to the last measure where it says
return<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.840> down<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.170> there's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> whole<00:00:58.710> tier

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
return on down when there's a whole tier

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
return on down when there's a whole tier
and<00:00:59.190> there's<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.510> E<00:01:01.170> flat<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.739> holding

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and there's an E flat and you're holding

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
and there's an E flat and you're holding
at<00:01:02.160> E<00:01:02.250> flat<00:01:02.430> you've<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.359> while

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
at E flat you've got to think while

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
at E flat you've got to think while
you're<00:01:04.170> holding<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.769> you've<00:01:05.610> got<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> think

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you're holding that you've got to think

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.660 
you're holding that you've got to think
o<00:01:06.330> tempo<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.770> holding<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> you're

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
o tempo so you're holding it and you're

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.070 
o tempo so you're holding it and you're
thinking<00:01:10.189> 123456<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:11.939> count<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.299> double

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
thinking 123456 you can count it double

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
thinking 123456 you can count it double
time<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.380> always<00:01:13.619> saying<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:13.950> if

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
time that's always saying actually if

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.890 
time that's always saying actually if
you're<00:01:14.700> making<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> slower<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.750> you're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you're making it slower or you're

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.660 
you're making it slower or you're
holding<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> fermata<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:17.939> go

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
holding it with the fermata you could go

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.240 
holding it with the fermata you could go
123456<00:01:21.710> 123456<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.920> least<00:01:23.100> you're

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
123456 123456 but least you're

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
123456 123456 but least you're
establishing<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.850> tempo<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> came

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
establishing that tempo and when I came

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.929 
establishing that tempo and when I came
back<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.830> yesterday<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> was

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
back in yesterday I don't think that was

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.270 
back in yesterday I don't think that was

but<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.850> seems<00:04:48.090> very<00:04:48.300> flat<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:49.020> me<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.500> I'm

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
but it seems very flat to me so I'm

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.580 
but it seems very flat to me so I'm
going<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.040> add<00:04:50.220> at<00:04:50.850> least<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.330> G<00:04:51.510> sharp<00:04:51.750> key<00:04:54.590> ok

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
going to add at least the G sharp key ok

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830 
going to add at least the G sharp key ok
and<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:57.000> helps<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.330> little<00:04:57.510> bit<00:04:57.630> with<00:04:57.750> the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
and that it helps a little bit with the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.300 
and that it helps a little bit with the
intonation<00:04:58.080> sometimes<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.010> can<00:04:59.130> actually

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
intonation sometimes you can actually

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.450 
intonation sometimes you can actually
add<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.580> AMG<00:05:00.210> shop<00:05:00.420> if<00:05:00.600> it's<00:05:00.720> real<00:05:01.050> flat

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
add the AMG shop if it's real flat

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.650 
add the AMG shop if it's real flat
usually<00:05:02.460> it's<00:05:02.580> not<00:05:02.640> that<00:05:02.880> case<00:05:03.090> but<00:05:03.330> just<00:05:03.510> in

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
usually it's not that case but just in

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.020 
usually it's not that case but just in
case<00:05:03.690> also<00:05:04.560> I've<00:05:04.890> been<00:05:04.920> alternating<00:05:05.520> for

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
case also I've been alternating for

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.850 
case also I've been alternating for
myself<00:05:06.480> between<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:07.200> D<00:05:07.470> flat<00:05:07.710> at<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.100> end<00:05:09.860> ok

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
myself between this D flat at the end ok

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.200 
myself between this D flat at the end ok
or<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:13.880> or<00:05:16.070> without<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.280> top<00:05:17.490> finger<00:05:17.850> you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
or this or without the top finger you

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.030 
or this or without the top finger you
can<00:05:18.330> actually<00:05:18.510> use<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:19.020> e<00:05:19.260> flat<00:05:19.680> and

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
can actually use this e flat and

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.680 
can actually use this e flat and
sometimes<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:21.030> little<00:05:21.240> bit<00:05:21.570> better

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
sometimes it's a little bit better

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.190 
sometimes it's a little bit better
that's<00:05:22.380> my<00:05:22.650> opinion<00:05:22.950> um<00:05:23.700> just<00:05:24.630> another<00:05:24.990> little

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
that's my opinion um just another little

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.000 
that's my opinion um just another little
caveat<00:05:25.650> I<00:05:25.680> didn't<00:05:26.070> do<00:05:26.220> quite<00:05:26.550> well<00:05:26.670> um<00:05:27.450> I<00:05:28.440> was

piece<00:06:49.670> of<00:06:49.880> discrimination<00:06:50.270> for<00:06:50.900> you<00:06:51.080> there<00:06:52.660> um

listen<00:06:58.070> to<00:06:58.100> other<00:06:58.460> pieces<00:06:58.940> of<00:06:59.090> music<00:06:59.740> that

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
listen to other pieces of music that

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.200 
listen to other pieces of music that
relate<00:07:02.410> that<00:07:03.410> perhaps<00:07:03.620> could<00:07:03.890> relate<00:07:04.400> to<00:07:04.640> what

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210

you're<00:07:05.240> doing<00:07:06.040> it<00:07:07.040> might<00:07:07.370> help<00:07:07.700> you<00:07:07.880> a<00:07:07.910> lot<00:07:08.240> and
