00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.269
 member of the family of reptiles 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.359
 chameleons and mainly in africa 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.030
 and in the surrounding islands they are 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.100
 mostly encounters forest or in 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:48.970
 the humid scrub plains of 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:52.350
 preferably it's one of the scar guys that 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.449
 I approached this curious little animal 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.940
 their long tails that can wrap 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:06.429
 on them even allows them to strengthen 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:09.100
 their taken in arms the backs of 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.630
 pasta forms a pass that grasp 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.649
 securely the branches when 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.320
 moves three fingers one side of 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.160
 the other constitute the two jaws 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.160
 7.1 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.720
 chameleons are often equipped with 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.980
 helmets and pancakes 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.670
 this craze are more or less 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.020
 developed according to the species and some 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 present on the heads of large 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.420
 horns up to 3 cm 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.890
 smaller species make less 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 10 cm and the largest ones reach 70 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.270
 cm that contradict 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.840
 summer dresses but we loved them 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.350
 differentiate 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.350
 each having given rise to a familiar state 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.200
 but lyon one rather earthly have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.570
 usually a brown dress while 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 the arboreal species is no longer spoken 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.840
 often yellow green he says 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.390
 chameleons are best known for 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.080
 their ability to change quickly from 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.989
 colors they owe this faculty to the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.170
 presence of chromium soon cells 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.459
 of skin with pigments color it is 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.890
 not only of a method of 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.829
 camouflage but also a mechanism 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.230
 instinctive communication by these 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.319
 color variations the trucks make 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.970
 from their states to their congeners 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:52.810
 stress parry bridal gestation disease

 temperature submission the eyes of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.500
 chameleons his first mini is animated from 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.790
 independent movements this device 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.880
 allows animals to monitor all 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.569
 the sides both in convergence on 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.600
 their target 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.230
 it is to them now ensures their 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.540
 vision of a rare precision 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.700
 on the other hand being devoid of sticks 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.700
 they are hardly effective in black 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.570
 to hunt the insects they are 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.560
 fond of chameleons use their 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.470
 Proactive language is for the same good 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.230
 stowed in the mouth then this its strength 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:41.330
 in his propulsive muscles and 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:44.190
 retracting it is with a rare precision 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 that he projects his tongue on his prey 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.170
 and bring them back thanks to the burning mucus 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.610
 that garnish are extremely low 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.340
 depending on the species this language can 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:02.550
 reach the length of the animal and 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:05.910
 to be projected more than 20 km to some 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.300
 larger also consumes small 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.590
 birds or even small lizards he 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.920
 is small who feed on 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:19.940
 fruit and fun the chameleons will 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.959
 they survive deforestation 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.959
 only the future we learn it 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.360
