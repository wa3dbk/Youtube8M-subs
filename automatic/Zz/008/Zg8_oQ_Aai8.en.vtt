00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everyone i hope everything 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.359
 roll for you I find for a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.340
 little outfit of the day it's nothing 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.210
 Extraordinary ones a little styling 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
 since it's the end of the day a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.940
 hispano here I wanted to do a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 little outfit of the day because the sun 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 come back and inevitably when the sun 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.980
 come back except he comes out his orange colors 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.779
 and coral I want to say it's a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.010
 obsession 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.660
 then at the level of the hair then already 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 I changed I do not know if you 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.150
 make it clear that in fact I had 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.119
 the hair that's happening to me has shown up 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.430
 there and I had everything cut because they 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.059
 were too long so managed degraded 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.260
 managed dark my hair I will make you 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 maybe a little topo about 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070
 new colors that I use a 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 call so they use that is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.290
 dressing table 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.270
 what I really like this one you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.789
 do not see them close there are reflections 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.260
 super nice here is just cordoned off 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.079
 hair and make me alice and so you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.610
 do some volume then I have a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.260
 small milk check blouse 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.210
 Toussaint make tiles that are 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.229
 brown beige white orange coral 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.020
 here and down I have a little skirt in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.939
 jeans 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.299
 so I do not know if you're going to see who 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.250
 is my faith a little short 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.750
 beaucourt everything is relative it happens to me 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 not under the butt either but there 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.409
 see there at the level of the shoes I 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.500
 decided to put ballerinas a little 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.510
 Coral with a title that recalls Brown 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 because I know what to practice for 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.800
 I do not want to put too much talent 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.300
 and also because I wanted to 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.470
 after cutting it a little bit 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.960
 silhouette it was not the best 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.370
 shoes to be to appear for 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 to have slender legs macha all that 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.770
 but it's also my style to be a little 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 relaxed so that's not it 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.590
 necessarily chose high heels 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.430
 levels of sludge dredged from the ends of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 rec and my month cottage offered 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.940
 it's super beautiful at the level of thyme there 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.729
 I am very very hot because I 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.100
 come back from work so I took a 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.750
 sweated in the car but I had put 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.560
 concretely foundation avesnes that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.790
 I introduced you to my favorites 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.170
 a little bit of blush a little bit of 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.510
 avesnes powder this time I have not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.640
 1000 to 38.6 djemila shine that makes a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.370
 effect maybe - malta but I like 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 well a little quick mascara a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.489
 little bit of quick pencil and on 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.380
 lips of a lipstick of the brand 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.800
 flow bitrate I know more where of 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.350
 thunderstorms do not know anymore it's a species 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.250
 of orange is great I say that I put 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.700
 all the time because he's a good 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.190
 moisturizer for the lips here otherwise 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.630
 level of the other accessories nothing of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.220
 especially it's my rings that I put 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.660
 all the time on the nails I have a 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.010
 thing that is all your notebooks and that he 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.840
 I have to change because here it is 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 got the trunk knows nothing to see there 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 is pink and more so that I did not have the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.880
 time of the exit otherwise for others 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.880
 accessories 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.070
 so this little purse that I bought 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.030
 with us a year or two ago who is 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.680
 coral that exist romy 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.450
 it's my little handbag confirming his 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.910
 close to the he has plenty of pockets plus he 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.190
 is cool and otherwise this morning as it is 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.800
 still a little cool I took out my super 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.680
 coral jacket 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.190
 it is too good i like last year 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.600
 or two he is too pretty I think 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.030
 the color is too beautiful for 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.280
 inside it's a bit in relays 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.050
 or by a dog by internet or by game 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.090
 not necessarily fan of the leopard pattern but 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:41.190
 the color he is really too 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:44.610
 today for so I like biron a 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.910
 rejected a little fast day outfit 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.460
 that's nothing extraordinary usually 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.710
 a biya it's just for cheap 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.330
 since having the jacket that had to me 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.420
 cost in the 30 euros and still you 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.550
 see it's not even very expensive we sweat the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.350
 rest is stuff that costs maximum 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.080
 20 euros finally whether it's in the water or 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.660
 in the edge c max 20 euros in may 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.830
 and my side shoes 10 euros so me 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.000
 I always manage to get out of bed and 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.600
 finally my edge we can get dressed 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.530
 for years we buy crazy stuff 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.310
