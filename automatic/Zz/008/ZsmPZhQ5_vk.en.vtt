 plans returns to open cargo 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.450
 quickly the number 6 she could 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 to cross or the spectacular race tico 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.100
 and what fantastic number driving 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.650
 nine juan curuvija cats just to be 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.709
 finished the fixed I know if definitely 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.750
 a foal has really shown a 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.970
 tremendous quality was very brave what 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.240
 indicated today a decision of Gonzalez 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.800
 that they have to take at the tip just 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.120
 formalized the development the others 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.370
 they came means stopping half wanting 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.380
 grab her decided to just go forward 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.250
 is missing 20 meters and inside 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.410
 he got on the planet and he really won 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 It won very well inside but you know 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.350
 that one of the things that called me the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.910
 villagra's attention was that he always 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.710
 he brought inside even though they came 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.440
 many horses together he always the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.840
 worked inside the sun planet what 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.480
 it has really been an excellent management 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.660
 of this jockey is not true what happens 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.350
 that Pedro Miguel one of started already 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 we all know in the room the conditions 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.940
 that they have miguel pérez to train and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.280
 he likes to run close to the sticks 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.500
 because he says it is always shorter 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.730
 travel and is really right what 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.620
 what happens that sometimes greeting 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.930
 complicated in this case when villagra 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.030
 it was impeccable he was freed a lot 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.590
 traffic when entering the right and took advantage 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 the very professional foal inside 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.310
 had returned 20 days ago if 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.530
 he really stayed with this 2012 support 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.260
 in a remarkable way and also thinks well 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.210
 marcelo because he told you clearly when 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.200
 went out into the hall to remember what you 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.770
 He said 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.450
 do not talk to me define that fantastic 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.930
 because in a colt of foals you speak 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.920
 that way really 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.450
 definitely not definitely 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.359
 hugs from all the pawn team 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.540

 veterinarian gustavo gatti and really 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.730
 a huge joy for the whole team 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.740

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.640
 vick casanova 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.050
 and we are seeing the joy of the self that 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.510
 I 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.440
 and I do not know I do not think it won many groups 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.440
 one villagrán 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.770
 We are going to look for Walter who we 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.820
 are coming to the pictures this is almost 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.300
 I would almost tell you about a movie, there's no 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.430
 way to retain it happened from 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.950
 long the photo deserved will be taken if 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.470
 they have incredible joy here 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.220
 images are crystal clear and truly 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.020
 he threw a whip a friend hugged us 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.730
 good to pay the 66 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.760
 definitely but they all pass 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.180
 running like a horse hug 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.090
 hug villagra 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.530
 to hug me give me a jiffy that had 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.479
 some data marcelo 1 3436 cents that 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.400
 I find it very good time for the cock 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.639
 yes definitely set aside and remember 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.860
 that the wind against the straight 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:03.490
 the ideal climate and really really was 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.379
 the time for extraordinary support 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.270
 let's go to a little parenthesis already 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:12.340
 we come back immediately with the reflections 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.340
 on the target already of positive 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.129
 we are seeing viewers we are 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.620
 watching the replay of the 2012 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.389
 exactly what is it 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.000
 had had repressing he had won 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.280
 porcine and good after running another 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.430
 race very well and with honey we decided 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.990
 run to support 4 which means for you 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.580
 this height of your professional life with 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.630
 the support do not go miguel the truth 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.340
 that is very nice they are not giving me 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.740
 things very fast do not have to follow 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.620
 working for these triumphs with 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.389
 a good step this one help I did not have much 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.919
 rotten to keep close to the stick not yes 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.810
 the truth that yes over there half ate 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.120
 a little box but the horse is very 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.229
 light and he gets good that you're like that 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.229
 that the truth that helped me a lot 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.639
 we go with Miguel Perez norberto let me 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.680
 that we chatted before the race and 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:14.470
 now after imagine how uruguay 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.940
 the owners by nicola santander and 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.070
 walter velázquez 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.920
 the horse that I chose because 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.990
 when you can use the foal before 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.310
 debutar the mother was sold but look and 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.350
 walter that the same as going forward 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.160
 we have a puncture and there is a sister the 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.160
 I buy tomorrow 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.840
 and this is a foal that always when 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.760
 it flew from little one is another thing and the 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.950
 true that a barbarian horse with very 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.080
 good horse and to cheer up and what 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.170
 I said that before the blank this but look 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.490
 when he also won the other day I 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.300
 I doubted and I was more inclined to 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.150
 the martínez and osvaldo martínez tells me 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.190
 you know the mess attending queues 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.990
 but we started and there were many doubts 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.880
 but good is a great horse 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.700
 probably very good horse what 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.800
 it means for you to win it together and what 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.990
 most important thing that I had in my life is my 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.380
 son and that what I am most grateful 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.070
 thank God and supports good I always 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.320
 I say those who run are horses one 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.780
 with a good horse I have always said 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.249
 I have been touched with good horses all 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.349
 they are very good ratings thank you 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:27.899
