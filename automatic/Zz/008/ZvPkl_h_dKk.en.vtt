blending<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.250> out<00:05:03.490> with<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:04.060> same

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
blending this out with the same

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.870 
blending this out with the same
foundation<00:05:05.410> brush<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.800> had<00:05:06.010> used<00:05:06.280> earlier

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
foundation brush I had used earlier

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.820 
foundation brush I had used earlier
because<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.540> just<00:05:07.570> helps<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.320> foundation

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
because that just helps the foundation

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.640 
because that just helps the foundation
and<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.070> concealer<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:10.030> meld<00:05:10.540> in<00:05:10.840> together<00:05:11.140> I

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
and the concealer to meld in together I

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.350 
and the concealer to meld in together I
think<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.520> most<00:05:12.850> perfect

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
think this is the most perfect

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.420 
think this is the most perfect
combination<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:14.350> concealer<00:05:14.740> with<00:05:15.280> that

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
combination this concealer with that

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.160 
combination this concealer with that
foundation<00:05:15.790> they<00:05:16.240> really<00:05:16.540> do<00:05:16.720> work<00:05:16.900> well

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
foundation they really do work well

with some bronzer to contour out those
cheekbones<00:06:08.380> and<00:06:09.070> I<00:06:10.030> also<00:06:10.300> used<00:06:10.780> some<00:06:11.350> blush<00:06:11.620> as

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
cheekbones and I also used some blush as

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.680 
cheekbones and I also used some blush as
well<00:06:12.070> but<00:06:12.490> this<00:06:12.580> was<00:06:12.760> a<00:06:12.790> really<00:06:13.060> really<00:06:13.330> light

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
well but this was a really really light

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.780 
well but this was a really really light
pink<00:06:13.990> shade<00:06:14.260> with<00:06:14.470> a<00:06:14.500> little<00:06:14.800> bit<00:06:14.950> of<00:06:14.980> shimmer

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
pink shade with a little bit of shimmer

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.120 
pink shade with a little bit of shimmer
in<00:06:16.060> it<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.420> it<00:06:16.570> kind<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:16.810> worked<00:06:17.020> as<00:06:17.200> a<00:06:17.470> blush

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
in it so it kind of worked as a blush

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.370 
in it so it kind of worked as a blush
and<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.580> highlight<00:06:19.030> mixed<00:06:19.450> into<00:06:19.780> one<00:06:19.810> just<00:06:20.260> you

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.080 
massaging this area to make it look more
smoky<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:35.590> going<00:06:35.950> over<00:06:36.130> once<00:06:36.460> again<00:06:36.790> with

smoky and going over once again with
more<00:06:37.300> color<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:38.230> way<00:06:38.440> the<00:06:38.920> outer<00:06:39.280> corner<00:06:39.820> of

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
more color that way the outer corner of

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
the under eye area is smoked out but

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.510 
the under eye area is smoked out but
still<00:06:43.300> there<00:06:43.510> is<00:06:43.690> some<00:06:44.050> definition<00:06:44.770> to<00:06:44.980> it<00:06:45.130> and

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
still there is some definition to it and

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.880 
still there is some definition to it and
then<00:06:45.730> I<00:06:45.760> decided<00:06:46.240> that<00:06:46.390> I<00:06:46.540> wanted<00:06:46.990> to<00:06:47.050> bring

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
then I decided that I wanted to bring

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.950 
then I decided that I wanted to bring
that<00:06:47.950> liner<00:06:48.430> all<00:06:48.730> the<00:06:48.910> way<00:06:49.030> into<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.810> inner

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
that liner all the way into the inner

00:06:49.960 --> 00:07:03.720 
that liner all the way into the inner
corner<00:06:50.500> so<00:06:50.710> I<00:06:50.770> went<00:06:51.010> ahead<00:06:51.160> and<00:06:51.370> did<00:06:51.940> that

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.520 

going<00:07:04.730> back<00:07:04.880> in<00:07:05.090> with<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:05.630> same<00:07:05.810> mascara<00:07:06.260> once

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
going back in with the same mascara once

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.170 
going back in with the same mascara once
again<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:07.100> applying<00:07:07.370> this<00:07:07.520> to<00:07:07.730> the<00:07:07.850> lower
