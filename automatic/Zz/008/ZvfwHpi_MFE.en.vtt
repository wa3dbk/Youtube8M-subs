00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.589
 no hi the frenchy so today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 I will introduce you to a character 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.620
 you already know so bruno you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.030
 have already seen it in life must 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 to support these torches so 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.490
 today is going to spit us out of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.049
 slow motion 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.059
 I had already done it on one of my 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.350
 personal choice but hey I'm going to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.670
 to share with you so seeing that in this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.480
 moment we do not hurt this volume at 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 so that's so bruno explains everything 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.789
 what to spit fire how that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 works 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.650
 the goal is to have it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.239
 a lot of pressure to take as much 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.329
 de fla or recent things back 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.250
 that but it's also because compared to 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.809
 Memorandum of wind and suddenly it would be the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.610
 with a product as special actually 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.010
