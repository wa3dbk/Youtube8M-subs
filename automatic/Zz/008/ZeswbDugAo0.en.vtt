forty from audio line these things are

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
forty from audio line these things are
pretty<00:00:44.190> basic<00:00:44.430> they're<00:00:45.110> three<00:00:46.110> kilometer

headsets<00:01:03.979> it's<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.159> particular<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
headsets it's not particular that's it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.780 
headsets it's not particular that's it
it's<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.500> something<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> clock

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it's just like something like a clock

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's just like something like a clock
and<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:10.500> microphone<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:12.450> your

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and a microphone you know this from your

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.249 
and a microphone you know this from your
cell<00:01:13.080> phone<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.830> they're<00:01:14.340> safe<00:01:14.610> PTT<00:01:15.210> button

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
cell phone and they're safe PTT button

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.929 
cell phone and they're safe PTT button
push-to-talk<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> push<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
push-to-talk so you have to push it and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.310 
push-to-talk so you have to push it and
you<00:01:18.479> hold<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.310> talk

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
you hold it down and then you talk

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.289 
you hold it down and then you talk
generally<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> would<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.670> great<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.150> when

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
generally this would be great but when

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.399 
generally this would be great but when
you're<00:01:24.420> playing<00:01:24.540> paintball

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you're playing paintball

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.760 
you're playing paintball
it's<00:01:26.090> none<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> useful<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.320> you're

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's none not so useful because you're

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
it's none not so useful because you're
holding<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.220> weapon<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.479> press<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
holding the weapon and you can press the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.530 
holding the weapon and you can press the
button<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.310> need<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.640> our

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
button when you really need it so our

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.069 
button when you really need it so our
fort

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
fort

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.600 
fort
voice<00:01:34.500> recognition<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> good

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
voice recognition would be a good

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.670 
voice recognition would be a good
feature<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.479> phones<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> feature

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
feature and these phones have a feature

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.100 
feature and these phones have a feature
like<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.939> called<00:01:39.150> box<00:01:39.420> voice<00:01:39.869> recognition

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
like it's called box voice recognition

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.289 
like it's called box voice recognition
and<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.840> trick<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.310> modify<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and the trick is you have to modify the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.399 
and the trick is you have to modify the
remote<00:01:45.770> -<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:50.270> walkie-talkie

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
remote - and actually the walkie-talkie

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
remote - and actually the walkie-talkie
recognize<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.710> talking<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.579> switch

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
recognize that you're talking and switch

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.499 
recognize that you're talking and switch
on<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.130> push-to-talk<00:01:56.130> button<00:01:56.310> by<00:01:56.670> itself<00:01:57.000> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
on the push-to-talk button by itself so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.139 
on the push-to-talk button by itself so
the<00:01:58.320> basic<00:01:58.710> trick<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> modify<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> circuit

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the basic trick is to modify the circuit

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.840 
the basic trick is to modify the circuit
in<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.659> I'll<00:02:00.869> show<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.469> second<00:02:01.850> and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
in here I'll show you in a second and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.209 
in here I'll show you in a second and
then<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.780> glue<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.140> inside<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.009> mask

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
then you just glue it inside the mask

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.429 
then you just glue it inside the mask
and<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> great<00:02:06.329> system<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.869> intercom

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and you have a great system for intercom

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.830 
and you have a great system for intercom
when<00:02:07.619> you're<00:02:07.770> playing<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:09.020> -<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> March

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
when you're playing so - the March

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.090 
when you're playing so - the March
okay<00:02:12.840> let's<00:02:13.050> check<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.440> hack<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
okay let's check the hack we have this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.220 
okay let's check the hack we have this
little<00:02:17.100> remote<00:02:17.940> here<00:02:18.210> with<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> push-button

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
little remote here with the push-button

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.180 
little remote here with the push-button
switch<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:21.030> bridge<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.690> switch

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
switch and we have to bridge the switch

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
switch and we have to bridge the switch
doesn't<00:02:23.190> run<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.820> well<00:02:24.810> here's<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.190> circuit

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
doesn't run so well here's the circuit

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.090 
doesn't run so well here's the circuit
board<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> switch<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
board and this is the switch and you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.400 
board and this is the switch and you
have<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.580> make<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> connection<00:02:30.510> from<00:02:30.840> here<00:02:30.930> to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
have to make a connection from here to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.910 
have to make a connection from here to
here<00:02:31.650> or<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.820> here<00:02:32.940> or<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.680> these

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
here or here to here or just just these

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.830 
here or here to here or just just these
two<00:02:35.220> pins<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.730> switch<00:02:36.090> needs<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.660> be

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
two pins of the switch needs to be

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.400 
two pins of the switch needs to be
bridged

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
bridged

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.740 
bridged
so<00:02:37.590> take<00:02:37.890> your<00:02:38.040> soldiering<00:02:38.490> iron<00:02:38.700> already<00:02:39.510> did

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
so take your soldiering iron already did

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.330 
so take your soldiering iron already did
that<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:41.030> make<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.210> connection<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.340> then

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that and make that connection and then

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.530 
that and make that connection and then
yeah<00:02:45.180> reattach<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.110> cover<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.860> can

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
yeah reattach the cover you can

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.280 
yeah reattach the cover you can
alternatively<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.750> wrap<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
alternatively just you know wrap the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.730 
alternatively just you know wrap the
switch<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.990> dressed<00:02:54.990> all<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.500> time

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
switch so it just dressed all the time

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.120 
switch so it just dressed all the time
but<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.850> electronic<00:02:57.450> approach<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.770> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
but I think the electronic approach is a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.300 
but I think the electronic approach is a
little<00:02:59.280> bit<00:02:59.610> sturdier<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:01.260> take<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:01.830> more

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
little bit sturdier and can take up more

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.540 
little bit sturdier and can take up more
abuse<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.320> can<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.770> mask<00:03:08.010> I've

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
abuse so here you can see the mask I've

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.180 
abuse so here you can see the mask I've
just<00:03:09.390> use<00:03:10.290> these<00:03:10.920> nipples<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.890> attach<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
just use these nipples to attach the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.090 
just use these nipples to attach the
microphone<00:03:14.400> with<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> cable<00:03:15.180> tie<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:16.500> guess

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
microphone with a cable tie and I guess

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.750 
microphone with a cable tie and I guess
well<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.180> easily<00:03:18.540> do<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.020> as<00:03:19.260> well<00:03:19.440> just

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
well you can easily do it as well just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.970 
well you can easily do it as well just
put<00:03:20.760> some<00:03:21.060> some<00:03:21.540> tape<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.930> there<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.470> secure

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
put some some tape in there and secure

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.800 
put some some tape in there and secure
it<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.730> microphone<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.390> actually

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
it so the microphone is actually

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.560 
it so the microphone is actually
important<00:03:25.200> pointing<00:03:25.680> downwards<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.570> just

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
important pointing downwards and just

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.600 
important pointing downwards and just
secure<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.080> cables<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.580> a

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
secure the cables so you have the a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.310 
secure the cables so you have the a
piece<00:03:29.970> which<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.600> easily<00:03:30.780> put<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.200> your

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
piece which you can easily put in your

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.650 
piece which you can easily put in your
ear<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:32.250> other<00:03:32.280> cable<00:03:32.760> hanging<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
ear and the other cable hanging on the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.710 
ear and the other cable hanging on the
downside<00:03:34.140> yeah<00:03:34.590> I'll<00:03:35.280> show<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.120> look<00:03:36.630> at

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
downside yeah I'll show you you look at

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.940 
downside yeah I'll show you you look at
it<00:03:36.870> done<00:03:37.260> quite<00:03:37.650> quickly

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.900 

to<00:03:47.950> play<00:03:48.160> without<00:03:48.490> putting<00:03:48.880> funds<00:03:49.210> thank<00:03:49.720> you
