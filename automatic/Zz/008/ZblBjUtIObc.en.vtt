00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
could fix this easily with a slight

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.249 
could fix this easily with a slight
black<00:01:13.950> marker<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:16.729> permanent<00:01:17.729> marker

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
black marker or a permanent marker

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.390 
black marker or a permanent marker

looks a straight line and that's the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.440 
looks a straight line and that's the
