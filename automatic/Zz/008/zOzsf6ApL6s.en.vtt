designer<00:00:33.210> when<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> first<00:00:33.780> saw<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.530> case<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
designer when I first saw this case I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.590 
designer when I first saw this case I
really<00:00:35.309> wasn't<00:00:35.489> sure<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
really wasn't sure what to make of it I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
really wasn't sure what to make of it I
was<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.710> interesting

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
was like this is this is interesting

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
was like this is this is interesting
it's<00:00:38.550> definitely<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> loom<00:00:39.450> tech<00:00:39.690> watch<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
it's definitely a loom tech watch it

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
it's definitely a loom tech watch it
fits<00:00:40.410> within<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> brand<00:00:41.040> personality<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
fits within the brand personality but

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.360 
fits within the brand personality but
it's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> different<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.620> design<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it's a different kind of of design the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
it's a different kind of of design the
case<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.760> 44<00:00:45.239> millimeters<00:00:45.750> wide<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
case is 44 millimeters wide this one is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.690 
case is 44 millimeters wide this one is
in<00:00:47.100> steel<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.989> dark<00:00:49.440> gray<00:00:50.100> almost

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
in steel with a kind of dark gray almost

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.630 
in steel with a kind of dark gray almost
black<00:00:51.239> PVD<00:00:52.230> coating<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.129> say<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
black PVD coating and they say it's a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
black PVD coating and they say it's a
titanium<00:00:54.030> carbide<00:00:54.719> coating<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.379> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
titanium carbide coating so it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
titanium carbide coating so it's
supposed<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.640> very<00:00:56.760> scratch<00:00:57.090> resistant<00:00:57.660> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
supposed to be very scratch resistant it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
supposed to be very scratch resistant it
looks<00:00:57.930> cool<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.590> bezel<00:00:58.949> almost

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
looks cool actually the bezel almost

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830 
looks cool actually the bezel almost
looks<00:00:59.460> ceramic<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
looks ceramic because what they do is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.189 
looks ceramic because what they do is
they<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.309> brushed<00:01:03.000> finish<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> top

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
they have a brushed finish on the top

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
they have a brushed finish on the top
and<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> sides<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.549> polished<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and on the sides there it's polished and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.120 
and on the sides there it's polished and
that's<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.630> nice<00:01:06.840> usually<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> have

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's it's nice usually when you have

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.940 
that's it's nice usually when you have
watches<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.850> PVD<00:01:09.299> coated<00:01:09.770> what<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:10.890> do

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
watches that are PVD coated what they do

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
watches that are PVD coated what they do
is<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> whole<00:01:11.549> thing<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> same<00:01:12.210> tone<00:01:12.479> all

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
is the whole thing is the same tone all

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
is the whole thing is the same tone all
around<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.040> sucks<00:01:14.220> because

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
around and that kind of sucks because

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
around and that kind of sucks because
when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.659> cool<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.080> black<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
when you have it's cool to be black or a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
when you have it's cool to be black or a
dark<00:01:16.740> color<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.640> usually<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
dark color but usually when it's you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.969 
dark color but usually when it's you
know<00:01:18.689> naked<00:01:18.869> steel<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:19.890> those

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
know naked steel you get all those

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.530 
know naked steel you get all those
polishes<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.700> when<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.299> type<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
polishes so when they do this type of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.700 
polishes so when they do this type of
detailing<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.409> different

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
detailing where you have different

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
detailing where you have different
polishes<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.909> PVD<00:01:24.270> coated<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
polishes but it's also a PVD coated I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
polishes but it's also a PVD coated I
like<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> actually<00:01:26.640> looks

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
like that so what this actually looks

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.870 
like that so what this actually looks
like<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> me<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.900> an<00:01:28.290> evolution<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> design

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
like to me is an evolution on the design

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
like to me is an evolution on the design
of<00:01:30.119> something<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> Audemars<00:01:31.860> Piguet

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
of something like the Audemars Piguet

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
of something like the Audemars Piguet
Royal<00:01:32.790> Oak<00:01:33.119> where<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.780> 12<00:01:34.079> sided

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
Royal Oak where they have that 12 sided

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.830 
Royal Oak where they have that 12 sided
case<00:01:34.799> designed<00:01:35.220> by<00:01:35.400> Gerald<00:01:35.970> jente<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.600> one's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
case designed by Gerald jente this one's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
case designed by Gerald jente this one's
been<00:01:37.020> sort<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.530> stretched<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.430> little<00:01:38.700> bit

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
been sort of like stretched a little bit

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
been sort of like stretched a little bit
so<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.119> longer<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> like

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so it's longer so it's not kind of like

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.850 
so it's longer so it's not kind of like
a<00:01:40.920> perfectly<00:01:41.520> symmetrical<00:01:41.729> circle<00:01:42.860> that's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
a perfectly symmetrical circle that's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.319 
a perfectly symmetrical circle that's
interesting<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> look<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> that

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
interesting and if you look at it that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:45.740 
interesting and if you look at it that
way

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
way

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
way
I<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.320> understand<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> lot<00:01:47.070> about

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I think you can understand a lot about

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.980 
I think you can understand a lot about
where<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> design<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> bezel<00:01:48.509> came<00:01:48.810> from

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
where the design of the bezel came from

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.260 
where the design of the bezel came from
the<00:01:49.500> dial<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.950> very<00:01:49.979> deep<00:01:50.430> set<00:01:50.759> there's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> very

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the dial is very deep set there's a very

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.060 
the dial is very deep set there's a very
deep<00:01:53.060> deeply<00:01:54.060> richly<00:01:54.720> curved<00:01:55.070> philandering

there and then the dials down there this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.569 
there and then the dials down there this
is<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> phantom<00:02:00.600> version<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> one

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
is the phantom version and this is one

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.920 
is the phantom version and this is one
of<00:02:02.610> those<00:02:02.729> sort<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.329> call<00:02:03.479> black<00:02:03.719> on

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
of those sort of what they call black on

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.709 
of those sort of what they call black on
black<00:02:04.049> watches<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:05.130> lunatic<00:02:05.640> does<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.299> has<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
black watches what lunatic does is has a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
black watches what lunatic does is has a
sapphire<00:02:07.020> crystal<00:02:07.710> which<00:02:07.829> has<00:02:07.979> been<00:02:08.690> smoked<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
sapphire crystal which has been smoked a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.980 
sapphire crystal which has been smoked a
little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.619> it's

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
little bit so it's

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.360 
little bit so it's
little<00:02:11.110> bit<00:02:11.200> darker<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.860> same<00:02:12.100> thing<00:02:12.280> is

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
little bit darker and the same thing is

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.340 
little bit darker and the same thing is
in<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> movement<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.420> also<00:02:13.630> been<00:02:13.900> smoked<00:02:14.230> a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
in the movement it's also been smoked a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.630 
in the movement it's also been smoked a
little<00:02:14.530> bit<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.800> things<00:02:15.070> look<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.460> bit

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
little bit so things look a little bit

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.450 
little bit so things look a little bit
darker<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.240> gray<00:02:16.870> they're<00:02:17.650> still<00:02:17.890> luminance

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
darker and gray they're still luminance

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.670 
darker and gray they're still luminance
and<00:02:18.610> loom<00:02:18.910> tech<00:02:19.150> has<00:02:19.330> their<00:02:19.570> own<00:02:19.680> luminance

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and loom tech has their own luminance

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.390 
and loom tech has their own luminance
that<00:02:20.830> they<00:02:20.950> use<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:22.570> luminance<00:02:23.190> dark<00:02:24.190> it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
that they use the luminance dark it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.340 
that they use the luminance dark it
still<00:02:24.640> works<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.270> not<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.690> be<00:02:25.780> as<00:02:25.960> good

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
still works it's not going to be as good

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.680 
still works it's not going to be as good
as<00:02:26.680> their<00:02:27.220> other<00:02:27.370> luminance<00:02:27.970> loom<00:02:28.210> tech<00:02:28.420> makes

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
as their other luminance loom tech makes

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.900 
as their other luminance loom tech makes
their<00:02:28.870> own<00:02:28.900> loom<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.530> they<00:02:30.460> do<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.640> good<00:02:30.850> job

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
their own loom and they do a good job

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.390 
their own loom and they do a good job
that<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.390> really<00:02:31.630> good<00:02:31.750> luminance<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:33.130> here

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
that have really good luminance but here

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520 
that have really good luminance but here
it's<00:02:33.550> not<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.940> be<00:02:34.060> as<00:02:34.210> sort<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.230> bold

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it's not going to be as sort of bold

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.590 
it's not going to be as sort of bold
because<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.250> kind<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.820> dark<00:02:37.030> colored<00:02:37.420> one

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
because it's kind of a dark colored one

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.970 
because it's kind of a dark colored one
but<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.900> cool<00:02:38.140> when<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.710> thing

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
but it's cool when you have this thing

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.710 
but it's cool when you have this thing
in<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.460> light<00:02:39.640> for<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.910> long<00:02:39.940> time<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.450> it'll

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
in the light for a long time and it'll

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.900 
in the light for a long time and it'll
glow<00:02:41.020> kind<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.830> dull<00:02:42.100> gray<00:02:42.400> color<00:02:42.700> which

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
glow kind of this dull gray color which

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.210 
glow kind of this dull gray color which
is<00:02:43.060> kind<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.330> neat<00:02:43.570> still<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.800> legible

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
is kind of neat still it's a legible

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.950 
is kind of neat still it's a legible
watch<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.970> when<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.210> wear<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.750> wrist

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
watch so when you wear it on the wrist

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.800 
watch so when you wear it on the wrist
you<00:02:47.620> still<00:02:47.950> basically<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.540> kind

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
you still basically see that it's kind

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.900 
you still basically see that it's kind
of<00:02:49.960> black<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.440> black<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.920> dark<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.520> little

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
of black on black and dark and a little

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.850 
of black on black and dark and a little
bit<00:02:52.030> mysterious<00:02:52.210> but<00:02:53.140> when<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.380> look<00:02:53.590> at<00:02:53.740> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
bit mysterious but when you look at the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.130 
bit mysterious but when you look at the
watch<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.570> you're<00:02:55.720> not<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.020> have

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
watch you know you're not going to have

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.560 
watch you know you're not going to have
a<00:02:56.170> problem<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.830> determining<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:58.090> time<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.480> is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
a problem in determining what time it is

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.600 
a problem in determining what time it is
unless<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.680> know<00:02:59.800> really<00:03:00.160> really<00:03:00.250> dark

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
unless it's you know really really dark

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
unless it's you know really really dark
or<00:03:00.760> something<00:03:01.060> like<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.750> again<00:03:02.380> if

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
or something like that and again if

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.750 
or something like that and again if
you're<00:03:02.680> really<00:03:02.950> concerned<00:03:03.340> about<00:03:03.430> dark

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
you're really concerned about dark

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.340 
you're really concerned about dark
concealing<00:03:04.210> there<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.660> little<00:03:05.260> man

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
concealing there is that little man

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.020 
concealing there is that little man
there<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.100> wrist<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.460> looks<00:03:06.640> nice<00:03:06.820> it

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
there on the wrist it looks nice it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.570 
there on the wrist it looks nice it
actually<00:03:07.510> feels<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.080> little<00:03:08.110> bit<00:03:08.500> smaller<00:03:08.890> than

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
actually feels a little bit smaller than

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.400 
actually feels a little bit smaller than
44<00:03:10.180> millimeters<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> lot<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.020> loom<00:03:11.200> tech

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
44 millimeters a lot of loom tech

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.760 
44 millimeters a lot of loom tech
watches<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:11.920> I've<00:03:12.130> owned<00:03:12.460> are<00:03:13.020> larger<00:03:14.020> than

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
watches that I've owned are larger than

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.900 
watches that I've owned are larger than
this<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:14.980> but<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.460> one<00:03:15.640> feels<00:03:15.850> very

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
this one but this one feels very

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.240 
this one but this one feels very
reasonable<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.900> like<00:03:17.500> out<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.800> strap<00:03:18.070> here

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
reasonable I like out the strap here

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.440 
reasonable I like out the strap here
there's<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.460> couple<00:03:18.580> people<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.060> bow<00:03:19.180> strap

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
there's a couple people like bow strap

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.970 
there's a couple people like bow strap
it<00:03:19.570> looks<00:03:19.690> like<00:03:19.810> sort<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.050> an<00:03:20.170> evolved<00:03:20.530> aviator

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
it looks like sort of an evolved aviator

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.560 
it looks like sort of an evolved aviator
you<00:03:21.130> have<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.430> rivet<00:03:21.640> right<00:03:21.910> there<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.480> have

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
you have that rivet right there you have

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.300 
you have that rivet right there you have
the<00:03:22.690> contrast<00:03:23.200> stitching<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.800> then<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.160> have

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
the contrast stitching and then you have

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.550 
the contrast stitching and then you have
this<00:03:24.400> nice<00:03:24.610> kind<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.210> tapering<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.410> goes

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
this nice kind of a tapering that goes

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.120 
this nice kind of a tapering that goes
on<00:03:26.770> there

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
on there

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.710 
on there
it<00:03:27.190> makes<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:28.000> cool<00:03:28.270> look<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.690> think

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
it makes for a cool look and I think

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.420 
it makes for a cool look and I think
they<00:03:28.990> did<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.170> nice<00:03:29.410> job<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.860> trip<00:03:30.130> they

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
they did a nice job of this trip they

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.590 
they did a nice job of this trip they
could<00:03:30.610> have<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:30.730> throw<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.240> boring

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
could have just throw it on a boring

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.720 
could have just throw it on a boring
strap<00:03:31.960> there<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.650> moon<00:03:32.950> tech<00:03:33.160> didn't<00:03:33.430> do<00:03:33.550> that

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
strap there but moon tech didn't do that

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.680 
strap there but moon tech didn't do that
they<00:03:34.000> did<00:03:34.150> something<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.450> little<00:03:34.600> bit

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
they did something a little bit

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.600 
they did something a little bit
interesting<00:03:35.170> which<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.590> feel<00:03:35.830> really<00:03:36.040> matches

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
interesting which I feel really matches

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.430 
interesting which I feel really matches
the<00:03:36.820> case<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.570> makes<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.990> little<00:03:38.080> bit<00:03:38.290> more

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the case it makes it a little bit more

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.200 
the case it makes it a little bit more
military<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.070> little<00:03:39.310> bit<00:03:39.400> more<00:03:39.520> interesting<00:03:40.030> I

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
military a little bit more interesting I

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.060 
military a little bit more interesting I
think<00:03:40.840> they<00:03:40.990> did<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> good<00:03:41.350> job<00:03:41.410> inside<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
think they did a good job inside the

movement there are not a lot of loom
tech<00:03:48.520> watches<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.180> have<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:50.230> Swiss<00:03:50.470> Edda

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
tech watches that have the Swiss Edda

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.930 
tech watches that have the Swiss Edda
movements<00:03:51.160> in<00:03:51.250> there<00:03:51.370> but<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.640> one<00:03:51.910> of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
movements in there but this is one of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.550 
movements in there but this is one of
them<00:03:52.150> which<00:03:52.270> makes<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.720> considered<00:03:53.500> a

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
them which makes it considered a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.220 
them which makes it considered a
higher-end<00:03:54.220> piece<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.810> think<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.080> looks

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
higher-end piece and I think it looks

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.280 
higher-end piece and I think it looks
nice<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.560> dial<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:58.270> dial<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.600> growing<00:03:58.960> on<00:03:59.080> me

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
nice to dial the dial is growing on me

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.750 
nice to dial the dial is growing on me
at<00:03:59.560> first<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.040> wasn't<00:04:00.190> sure<00:04:00.400> what<00:04:00.490> to<00:04:00.550> make<00:04:00.730> of

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
at first I wasn't sure what to make of

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.310 
at first I wasn't sure what to make of
it<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.090> very<00:04:01.240> legible<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:01.840> very<00:04:01.990> easy<00:04:02.170> to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
it it's very legible it's very easy to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.580 
it it's very legible it's very easy to
see<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:03.370> wasn't<00:04:04.030> sure<00:04:04.300> if<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.480> hands<00:04:04.930> were<00:04:05.230> a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
see I wasn't sure if the hands were a

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.290 
see I wasn't sure if the hands were a
little<00:04:06.010> bit<00:04:06.130> too<00:04:06.250> much<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.850> type<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.209> would

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
little bit too much the type that would

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.270 
little bit too much the type that would
blend<00:04:07.600> in<00:04:07.780> with<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.020> our<00:04:08.140> indicators<00:04:08.770> but

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
blend in with the our indicators but

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.370 
blend in with the our indicators but
after<00:04:09.700> living<00:04:10.330> with<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.750> for<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> while<00:04:11.080> that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
after living with it for a while that

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.290 
after living with it for a while that
really<00:04:11.590> hasn't<00:04:11.950> proved<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:12.640> be<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.790> concern<00:04:13.150> at

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
really hasn't proved to be a concern at

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.330 
really hasn't proved to be a concern at
all<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.080> like<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.500> said<00:04:14.560> legible<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:15.250> an

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
all and it is like I said legible and an

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.979 
all and it is like I said legible and an
attractive<00:04:15.820> piece<00:04:16.000> I'd<00:04:16.420> like<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.690> see<00:04:16.840> them

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
attractive piece I'd like to see them

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.690 
attractive piece I'd like to see them
play<00:04:17.170> with<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.470> dial<00:04:17.709> as<00:04:17.950> well<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.549> future

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
play with the dial as well in the future

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.830 
play with the dial as well in the future
I<00:04:18.850> think<00:04:19.090> they<00:04:19.150> could<00:04:19.330> do<00:04:19.450> different<00:04:19.810> things

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
I think they could do different things

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.020 
I think they could do different things
with<00:04:20.080> future<00:04:20.530> v-series<00:04:21.010> watches<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.700> there's

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
with future v-series watches and there's

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.750 
with future v-series watches and there's
different<00:04:22.210> version

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
different version

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.120 
different version
the<00:04:23.000> v-series<00:04:23.330> there's<00:04:23.570> an<00:04:23.660> orange<00:04:23.960> one<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.290> I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
the v-series there's an orange one and I

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.340 
the v-series there's an orange one and I
don't<00:04:25.430> think<00:04:25.580> they're<00:04:25.790> all<00:04:25.940> PVD<00:04:26.420> dark<00:04:27.170> gray

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
don't think they're all PVD dark gray

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.570 
don't think they're all PVD dark gray
there's<00:04:27.590> different<00:04:27.830> versions<00:04:27.980> but<00:04:28.250> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.760 
there's different versions but the
