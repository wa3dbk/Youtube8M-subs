00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.300
 He also has my name compared to that of club as they welcome you 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.449
 the IDC White 2011 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.509
 for entertaining entertainment 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.239
 because my new model 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:18.220
 a test with 50 before, ZÃ© was one and Mountain 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.730
 for Le Monde 50 mm travel 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.999
 with the super light Volker Frohne 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.320
 we plan to have here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.339
 our proven are to be seen 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.519
 used several more goals so we have 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.290
 allow for all 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.380
 the same 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.650
 the same mistakes and characteristics concerning 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.650
 slows neutrality drive neutrality 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 transmission ratio 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.090
 for all the ladies left here soon 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.650
 Pam course technologies like 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.539
 DB Regio 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.539
 we have completely earned the moves in the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.620
 how important is 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 I wanted to under 2 kilos name so we now have 11 pounds 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.190
 Total weight is August Wyk with 450 mm travel 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.620
 We also have to get new ones for 2012 for the 15th time 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.080
 Name is program 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.690
 the bike has eight and a half should travel so 215 millimeters 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.290
 we have it at approx 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.320
 started planning three years ago 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.780
 Office at the beginning already 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.750
 with fox 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 Tesla have developed 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 how can we implement the optimal damping performance? 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.410
 are up then 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.590
 Tests optimal translation ratio of this damper get to Fox 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.040
 Deix rc4 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.040
 UN have been around this damper the whole thing was dismayed 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.240
 when dialing tight 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.320
 At the suspension travel was clear with one or two bellcrank 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.630
 we will be back 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.490
 too strong variations translation ratio what is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.960
 negative to the EM to stages 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.200
 can affect 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.760
 That's why we have 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.730
 this is triple for Turkey now he is one 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.690
 developed by pity lever reach because here 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.790
 over the entire the in disrepute at the Supercup is at Tesla 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.700
 Translation ratio with slight increase 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.139
 and so can the rebound over the whole 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.289
 to optimally realize 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.419
 Spycher 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.249
 Of course, it has all the features of the modern download 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.619
 flat steering angle 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.499
 FC is active lamentation 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.499
 compact rear triangle 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:28.359
 in this equipment costs 4699 euros complete Fox has different suspension 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.389
 and stabbed for the Dow 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.759
 Of course we should also have a topic for 2012 around us and names 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.979
 has stops from 599 euros 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.029
 Parma on one in front of him and the three outfits 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.029
 at 1120 2 Engine 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.439
 what was our objective we want the benefits 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.419
 use with big wheels 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.469
 But we want all the demands we have on our anesthesiology 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.539
 also implement 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.219
 it's called behind building plans Martic 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.599
 more for the same requirements in 26 inch range we have it between wide 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.599
 and should 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.259
 that means you and kinematics 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.349
 but it is said that all ladies behave with goose feather behavior 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:12.539
 we tried 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:13.999
 in rear triangle 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.019
 Wegner is deprived of keeping driving behavior relatively short 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.849
 very deep 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.729
 There is much more to it 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.909
 and we work 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.449
 also with special 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.619
 with special processing 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.879
 Mumbai Tibetan steering behavior to have 26 inches 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.369
 but for example on the PC in freedom 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.369
 Bandman him one with the larger tires 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:38.820
 Heinze 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.320
 120 plates start there at 1699 euros 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:44.889
 then go up 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.479
 to 3000 999 euros in the top version 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.779
 neither with 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.929
 like Sven Hedin's wheelset set 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.569
 Beat Zberg complete equipment and VOX the theme of color
