 poste 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.700
 scenes from other teeth on the fourth day of the 6 days 2012 the rain 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.180
 she's a copiosa in the night made the journey even more difficult 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.950
 especially the first lap so that the race direction decided to cancel the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.960
 first special 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.840
 then with the sun the wind the passage of the motorcycles the ground has gone yesterday to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.650
 to dry 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.120
 the blues stoically fought in the mud getting the second place of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.490
 day and recovering an 18 minute lead to the road in the general classification 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.560
 let's hear directly from the sea's voice rinaldi menager of the trophy 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.940
 blue as it was to follow space interviews pilots 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.010
 I hope they had a real classic enduro race they had 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.030
 it is announced the refusal ask for yours here. ornella zonkey shuppa how do you 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.790
 course 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.800
 I remember mountains 2004 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.939
 really hard 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.600
 good morning I'm the rain 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.960
 I wanted to do a little exemption so it was% 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.830
 classic routes in southwest roots and pine and stone roots 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.010
 and key with the moist soil you continue to dig 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.970
 and well these insidious roots come to bloom and I have seen pilots of the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.719
 caliber of the best 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.690
 has combined all the colors 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.690
 and today ro.linkedin.com post in Libya where 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.490
 we have now seen h2o episodes as printers like the French themselves 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.520
 I don't remember the names a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.380
 to having her already the motorcycles and resume the vision the momentum for 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.139
 go back to these from these slopes 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.099
 because however without any particular problem for the others I want to say the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.659
 race had regular development however 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.190
 d who did today 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.220
 or the result really deserved 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.139
 and not for nothing flights of Italy deserved seconds 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.439
 in front of the table chaos very strong roads that the football show 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.940
 and I believe that the Italians do 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.660
 and I believed you already from the beginning perhaps a little more to have or moreover 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.479
 had a little more confidence 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.679
 and the second place does not exclude 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:45.309
 and at this point in the situation or on the fourth day 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.679
 100 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:49.499
 third place and well deserved 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:54.289
 and we hope. to end with these two days that are missing and always succeeding 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:58.529
 at least tomorrow this good position to fight to earn money 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.219
 something more about the amazing Australians to have 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.350
 and that crumbs more confidence to 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.350
 said on the site 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.149
 miniclip as soon as the difficult days open 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:21.409
 if this year I started really badly I still don't know why today 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.579
 luckily I recovered a bit with some nice specials but you still can't hear me 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.039
 safe with the bike e 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.589
 really compare last year end 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:36.319
 the tao of twentieth place now is the type 50 pantheism 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.939
 absolute is really ugly 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.699
 I'm with another day 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.349

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.559

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.059
 Yes today 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.369
 I'm really tired in data center or later 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.330
 with the rain crisis 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
 a disaster. and it was hard
