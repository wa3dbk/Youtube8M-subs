00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
seen some interesting games on this map

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.469 
seen some interesting games on this map
and<00:01:15.350> we<00:01:16.350> saw<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.070> come<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and we saw not as to come when when it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.880 
and we saw not as to come when when it
looked<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.840> he<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.320> could<00:01:19.860> have

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
looked like he could have could have

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
looked like he could have could have
done<00:01:20.070> well<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> same<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.689> think

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
done well but at the same time I think

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.060 
done well but at the same time I think
this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.170> map<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
this is a map that you would have

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.410 
this is a map that you would have
thought<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.520> favor<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> Terran<00:01:24.299> player

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
thought would favor the Terran player

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
thought would favor the Terran player
because<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> positioning<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.710> rap

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
because of the positioning of that rap

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.560 
because of the positioning of that rap
especially<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> natural<00:01:26.700> Expo<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
especially about the natural Expo you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.760 
especially about the natural Expo you
thought<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.290> ideal<00:01:28.409> position

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
thought that would be an ideal position

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
thought that would be an ideal position
for<00:01:29.040> dropship<00:01:29.579> play<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.119> siege<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
for dropship play and for siege and the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
for dropship play and for siege and the
like<00:01:31.500> vs<00:01:31.920> protoss<00:01:32.220> players<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.000> be

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
like vs protoss players so be

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550 
like vs protoss players so be
interesting<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.810> how<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.110> game<00:01:34.259> turns

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
interesting to see how this game turns

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700 
interesting to see how this game turns
out<00:01:35.570> certainly<00:01:36.570> seems<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.020> more<00:01:37.200> balanced

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
out certainly seems to be more balanced

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.499 
out certainly seems to be more balanced
between<00:01:38.280> protons<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> taryn<00:01:39.150> than<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
between protons and taryn than it is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
between protons and taryn than it is
with<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.470> there's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> zerg<00:01:40.890> involved

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
with when there's a zerg involved

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
with when there's a zerg involved
clearly<00:01:41.909> clearly<00:01:42.119> horrible<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.899> deserved

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
clearly clearly horrible I'm deserved

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
clearly clearly horrible I'm deserved
nap<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.759> how<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> map<00:01:45.180> like

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
nap and I just don't know how a map like

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.480 
nap and I just don't know how a map like
this<00:01:45.360> got<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:45.840> testing<00:01:46.290> into<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> into

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this got through testing into the into

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.499 
this got through testing into the into
the<00:01:47.579> state<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> league<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.210> it'll<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the state of the league so it'll be to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.700 
the state of the league so it'll be to
see<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.780> sort<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> gameplay<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.590> from

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
fast expansion it has gone straight away

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.200 
fast expansion it has gone straight away
for<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> Nexus<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:56.880> interesting

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
for the Nexus that's an interesting

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
for the Nexus that's an interesting
strategy<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.719> Belize<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.070> be

strategies this isn't the map that you

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.559 
strategies this isn't the map that you

down<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.790> he's<00:02:48.880> gonna<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.330> he's<00:02:49.630> gonna

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
down and he's gonna see that he's gonna

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.330 
down and he's gonna see that he's gonna
see<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.110> fast<00:02:50.320> axis<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.830> as<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> comes<00:02:51.220> up

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
see that fast axis just as it comes up

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.460 
see that fast axis just as it comes up
any<00:02:52.030> times<00:02:52.209> got<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> gateway<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:52.900> as<00:02:53.019> well<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.350> he

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
any times got a gateway up as well so he

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.570 
any times got a gateway up as well so he
and<00:02:53.650> he's<00:02:53.739> now<00:02:53.890> looks<00:02:54.100> like<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.280> setting<00:02:54.430> up<00:02:54.519> a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
and he's now looks like you setting up a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.710 
and he's now looks like you setting up a
cybernetics<00:02:55.000> core<00:02:55.120> that's<00:02:55.269> exactly<00:02:55.600> what

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
cybernetics core that's exactly what

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.540 
cybernetics core that's exactly what
he's<00:02:55.810> doing<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.470> it'll<00:02:56.950> be<00:02:56.980> interesting<00:02:57.070> and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
he's doing so it'll be interesting and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.729 
he's doing so it'll be interesting and
froze<00:02:57.970> Ian<00:02:58.120> Usher's<00:02:58.420> away<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:58.959> probe<00:02:59.560> so

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
froze Ian Usher's away that but probe so

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.410 
froze Ian Usher's away that but probe so

I think time is not but I have too many

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.150 
I think time is not but I have too many

I'm surprised by posing this choice to

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.500 
I'm surprised by posing this choice to
put<00:03:55.600> that<00:03:55.750> command<00:03:56.049> center<00:03:56.320> down<00:03:56.440> now<00:03:57.510> giving

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
put that command center down now giving

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.970 
put that command center down now giving
up<00:03:58.630> almost<00:03:58.870> giving<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.320> his<00:03:59.440> technique<00:03:59.769> is<00:03:59.799> now

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
up almost giving up his technique is now

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.229 
up almost giving up his technique is now
putting<00:04:00.160> on<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.400> machine<00:04:00.640> shop<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:00.940> maybe<00:04:01.090> he

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
putting on the machine shop so maybe he

he's<00:05:21.520> gonna<00:05:21.640> see<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.910> sea<00:05:22.030> chance<00:05:22.270> anytime<00:05:22.480> as

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
he's gonna see the sea chance anytime as

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
he's gonna see the sea chance anytime as
accomplished<00:05:23.500> what<00:05:23.620> he<00:05:23.650> wanted<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.890> do<00:05:23.980> with

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
accomplished what he wanted to do with

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.800 
accomplished what he wanted to do with
the<00:05:24.160> season<00:05:24.400> he's<00:05:24.580> got<00:05:24.760> four<00:05:25.000> inches<00:05:25.480> is<00:05:25.630> gone

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
the season he's got four inches is gone

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.600 
the season he's got four inches is gone
for<00:05:25.960> siege<00:05:26.140> tech<00:05:26.440> first<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:26.860> he<00:05:26.920> hasn't<00:05:27.460> gone

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
for siege tech first so he hasn't gone

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.330 
for siege tech first so he hasn't gone
for<00:05:28.380> spider<00:05:29.380> mines<00:05:29.620> he's<00:05:29.800> gone<00:05:29.980> for<00:05:30.160> seat

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
for spider mines he's gone for seat

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.970 
for spider mines he's gone for seat
check<00:05:30.580> first<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.510> he<00:05:31.600> seized<00:05:31.870> up<00:05:32.080> outside<00:05:32.830> me

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
check first and he seized up outside me

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.290 
check first and he seized up outside me
so<00:05:33.070> he's<00:05:33.220> gonna<00:05:33.310> be<00:05:33.460> able<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.670> defend<00:05:33.790> that<00:05:34.090> and

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
so he's gonna be able to defend that and

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.060 
so he's gonna be able to defend that and
now<00:05:34.390> he's<00:05:34.540> put<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.750> on<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.870> couple<00:05:35.110> of<00:05:35.140> racks<00:05:35.380> and

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
now he's put it on a couple of racks and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.320 
now he's put it on a couple of racks and
that's<00:05:36.250> why<00:05:36.430> he's<00:05:36.610> put<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.910> Academy<00:05:37.210> down

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
that's why he's put the Academy down

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.670 
that's why he's put the Academy down
because<00:05:37.630> he<00:05:37.690> wants<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.020> have<00:05:38.260> something<00:05:38.620> to

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
because he wants to have something to

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.870 
because he wants to have something to
defense<00:05:38.920> he's<00:05:39.100> not<00:05:39.220> gonna<00:05:39.340> defend<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.700> siege

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
defense he's not gonna defend the siege

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.520 
defense he's not gonna defend the siege
tanks<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:40.420> that's<00:05:40.810> why<00:05:40.900> he<00:05:40.990> went<00:05:41.140> for<00:05:41.230> that's

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
tanks and that's why he went for that's

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.480 
tanks and that's why he went for that's
why<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:41.710> went<00:05:41.830> for<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.010> Academy<00:05:42.250> because<00:05:42.310> he

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
why you went for the Academy because he

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.890 
why you went for the Academy because he
went<00:05:42.670> for<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.820> siege<00:05:43.000> tank<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.390> he<00:05:43.510> wanted<00:05:43.780> to

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
went for the siege tank and he wanted to

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.150 
went for the siege tank and he wanted to
have<00:05:44.020> obviously<00:05:44.290> unis<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.560> defend<00:05:44.890> his<00:05:45.010> siege

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.020 
stomp over frozen I think there's gonna
be<00:07:05.710> one<00:07:05.800> of<00:07:05.860> those<00:07:05.920> no<00:07:06.130> contest<00:07:06.640> starcraft

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
be one of those no contest starcraft
