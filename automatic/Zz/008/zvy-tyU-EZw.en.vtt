she's starting to land something there's

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.830 
she's starting to land something there's
a<00:03:01.320> good<00:03:01.560> right<00:03:02.400> kind<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.790> glances<00:03:03.330> off<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:03.720> she

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
a good right kind of glances off if she

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.810 
a good right kind of glances off if she
catches<00:03:04.050> one<00:03:04.410> more<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> believe<00:03:05.010> right<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:05.640> oh

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
catches one more I believe right here oh

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.180 
catches one more I believe right here oh
I<00:03:05.880> got<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.720> right<00:03:06.960> behind<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.590> year<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.950> wind

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I got it right behind the year that wind

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.830 
I got it right behind the year that wind
it's<00:03:08.400> solid<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.450> did<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's solid and I think that did it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.660 
it's solid and I think that did it
it's<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.080> good<00:03:10.260> delayed<00:03:10.650> action<00:03:10.860> there<00:03:11.280> well

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it's a good delayed action there well

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.460 
it's a good delayed action there well
she<00:03:12.030> was<00:03:12.240> hurt<00:03:12.420> she<00:03:12.450> was<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.900> her<00:03:12.990> way<00:03:13.020> down<00:03:13.440> I

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
she was hurt she was on her way down I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.140 
she was hurt she was on her way down I
think<00:03:13.710> she<00:03:14.010> was<00:03:14.100> trying<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.460> stay<00:03:14.670> up<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:14.970> she

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
think she was trying to stay up but she

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.990 
think she was trying to stay up but she
was<00:03:15.270> disoriented<00:03:15.780> she's<00:03:16.470> yeah<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.610> guess

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
was disoriented she's yeah I guess

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.370 
was disoriented she's yeah I guess
