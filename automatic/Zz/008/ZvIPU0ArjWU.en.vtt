okay<00:00:02.750> we<00:00:03.750> will<00:00:03.780> apply<00:00:04.740> nano<00:00:05.310> tech<00:00:06.210> coating<00:00:06.750> on

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
okay we will apply nano tech coating on

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:23.279 
okay we will apply nano tech coating on
the<00:00:07.440> car<00:00:07.740> pain<00:00:08.660> there<00:00:09.660> are<00:00:09.960> three<00:00:10.469> areas

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
the second area we will apply nanotech

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.709 
the second area we will apply nanotech
coating<00:00:39.430> with<00:00:40.430> screen<00:00:41.300> method<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:44.449> third

area<00:00:45.219> we<00:00:46.219> will<00:00:46.460> apply<00:00:47.260> nanotech<00:00:48.260> coating<00:00:48.859> with

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
area we will apply nanotech coating with

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:11.850 
area we will apply nanotech coating with
wipe<00:00:50.059> method<00:00:51.879> ok<00:00:52.930> let's<00:00:53.930> begin

we<00:03:50.310> finished<00:03:51.080> applying<00:03:52.080> nanotech<00:03:52.950> coding

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
we finished applying nanotech coding

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.729 
we finished applying nanotech coding
after<00:03:54.900> 48<00:03:55.620> hours<00:03:55.860> we<00:03:56.760> will<00:03:56.940> test<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:58.230> usage

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
after 48 hours we will test the usage

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.580 
after 48 hours we will test the usage
