00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.000 
they say that because they've hired they
hide<00:03:51.269> Garcia<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.959> do<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.260> investigation<00:03:52.980> that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
hide Garcia to do the investigation that

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.039 
hide Garcia to do the investigation that
they<00:03:53.310> are<00:03:53.489> somehow<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.970> knights<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.019> shining

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
they are somehow the knights in shining

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.190 
they are somehow the knights in shining
armor<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:55.889> I<00:03:56.130> think<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> truth<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.420> probably

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
armor but I think the truth is probably

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.460 
armor but I think the truth is probably
the<00:03:58.380> opposite<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.160> that's<00:03:59.370> in<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:01.049> instance

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
the opposite and that's in that instance

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.309 
the opposite and that's in that instance
okay<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.790> what<00:04:03.000> will<00:04:03.180> be<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.230> think

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
okay so what will be the do you think

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.229 
okay so what will be the do you think
the<00:04:04.620> knock-on<00:04:04.889> effect<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:06.000> this
