00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.150 
just a list of 10 things that have got
in<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:46.410> doesn't<00:00:46.620> matter<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.829> which<00:00:46.950> order

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
in and it doesn't matter in which order

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
ridiculous because I did not expect it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
ridiculous because I did not expect it

so it started off like that and is

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.510 
so it started off like that and is
eventually<00:01:15.450> become<00:01:16.110> pretty<00:01:17.040> big<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.430> I'm

runescape<00:01:20.490> thing<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.000> my<00:01:21.150> runescape<00:01:21.360> channel

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
runescape thing on my runescape channel

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.490 
runescape thing on my runescape channel
is<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.470> last<00:01:23.220> year<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.759> made<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.689> hundred<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
is that last year I made a hundred and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
is that last year I made a hundred and
eighty<00:01:25.770> seven<00:01:26.640> videos<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:28.009> cannot<00:01:29.009> believe

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
eighty seven videos I cannot believe

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.620 
eighty seven videos I cannot believe
that<00:01:29.520> I've<00:01:29.610> done<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> many<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.270> thought<00:01:30.570> maybe

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that I've done that many I thought maybe

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.740 
that I've done that many I thought maybe
a<00:01:31.110> hundred<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.060> worked<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.600> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a hundred or so but it worked out on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
a hundred or so but it worked out on
average<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.439> made<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.680> three<00:01:35.040> videos

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
average that are made about three videos

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.390 
average that are made about three videos
per<00:01:36.210> week<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.710> pretty<00:01:38.189> ridiculous

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
per week which is pretty ridiculous

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.870 
per week which is pretty ridiculous
that's<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.240> every<00:01:39.360> two<00:01:39.659> days<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:41.369> means<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's one every two days which means I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.550 
that's one every two days which means I
must<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.390> spent<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:43.020> say<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.259> about<00:01:43.409> an

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
must have spent just say it was about an

hoping maybe eight nine billion i
remember<00:04:24.849> talking<00:04:24.969> about<00:04:25.210> this<00:04:25.389> right<00:04:25.750> at<00:04:26.380> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
remember talking about this right at the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.940 
remember talking about this right at the
beginning<00:04:26.560> of<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
beginning of the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.440 
beginning of the
year<00:04:27.100> on<00:04:27.130> how<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.430> wanted<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> flip<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.270> much

adding<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:00.760> into<00:05:01.000> about<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.210> billion<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:01.810> then

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
adding up into about a billion and then

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.220 
adding up into about a billion and then
other<00:05:03.340> things<00:05:03.610> you<00:05:04.000> know<00:05:04.120> daily<00:05:04.810> stuff<00:05:05.020> just

other things you know daily stuff just

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.410 
other things you know daily stuff just
losing<00:05:05.590> here<00:05:05.740> losing<00:05:05.950> their<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:07.090> anyway

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
losing here losing their but anyway

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.820 
losing here losing their but anyway
things<00:05:07.630> like<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.840> happen<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.800> just

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
things like that happen and you just

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.330 
things like that happen and you just
move<00:05:09.160> on<00:05:09.600> this<00:05:10.600> year<00:05:10.900> also<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.470> managed<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.830> gain

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
move on this year also I managed to gain

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.400 
move on this year also I managed to gain
87<00:05:13.330> levels<00:05:13.690> which<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.920> was<00:05:15.370> reaching<00:05:15.580> max<00:05:16.410> cape

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
87 levels which I was reaching max cape

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.820 
87 levels which I was reaching max cape
but<00:05:18.630> once<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.720> get<00:05:19.840> closer<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.290> it<00:05:20.320> gets<00:05:20.620> a<00:05:20.680> lot

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
but once you get closer to it gets a lot

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.650 
but once you get closer to it gets a lot
harder<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.280> get<00:05:21.370> certain<00:05:21.700> levels<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.240> it

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
harder to get certain levels and it

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.470 
harder to get certain levels and it
takes<00:05:22.840> extremely<00:05:23.470> long<00:05:23.710> so<00:05:24.280> 87<00:05:24.820> levels<00:05:25.090> for<00:05:25.360> me

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
takes extremely long so 87 levels for me

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600 
takes extremely long so 87 levels for me
is<00:05:25.690> quite<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:25.960> lot<00:05:26.200> which<00:05:26.710> is<00:05:26.740> about<00:05:26.980> to<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.310> week

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
is quite a lot which is about to a week

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.400 
is quite a lot which is about to a week
or<00:05:27.820> one<00:05:28.060> every<00:05:28.330> three<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.780> half<00:05:28.810> days<00:05:29.080> which

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
or one every three and a half days which

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.760 
or one every three and a half days which
is<00:05:29.620> pretty<00:05:30.220> good<00:05:30.600> also<00:05:31.600> this<00:05:31.720> year<00:05:31.780> which<00:05:32.200> I'm

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
is pretty good also this year which I'm

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.500 
is pretty good also this year which I'm

I don't know how long I've spent on the
computer<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:44.230> year<00:05:44.470> but<00:05:44.650> it's<00:05:44.770> definitely

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
computer this year but it's definitely

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.390 
computer this year but it's definitely
in<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.520> thousands<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:47.110> few<00:05:47.800> thousands

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400

pretty<00:06:38.830> crazy<00:06:39.100> and<00:06:39.520> I'm<00:06:39.940> pretty<00:06:40.060> psyched

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
pretty crazy and I'm pretty psyched

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.900 
pretty crazy and I'm pretty psyched
about<00:06:40.480> that

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
about that

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.820 
about that
and<00:06:41.060> it's<00:06:41.660> definitely<00:06:41.960> not<00:06:42.110> going<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.620> be<00:06:42.710> my

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830
