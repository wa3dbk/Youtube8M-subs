00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.950
 Unfortunately, the survey showed that more 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.430
 half of you 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.210
 familiar with this poison in the form of beer wine 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.789
 and vodka 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.049
 but few know how to do it and I know 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.079
 and I will tell you with pleasure 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.489
 people learned to make alcohol lands 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.900
 times following the original way 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.659
 moral suzuki 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.659
 and grape juice was poured into the vessel 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.629
 cat water solution of vitamins sugar 

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.849
 enzymes by the way are very useful for 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.009
 human 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.199
 and launched in kind juice exchange 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.490
 bacteria 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.400
 and more expensive and not very big sweets and 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.380
 under the microscope you can see here it is bacteria but 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.010
 about her eyes you an example from 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.920
 here she eats sugar 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 and for the whole approach to put up tents about her 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 just goes on ethyl alcohol 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.750
 just two points pilarzh 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.670
 so alcohol is not that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.650
 other than match a cadres live bacteria 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.850
 but according to scientific experiments 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.120
 and here these bacteria devour sugar 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.960
 urinate urine 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.299
 and when the concentration of matches in the barrel 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.970
 reaches 11 percent 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.940
 like any living organism of a building 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.020
 own shit for a different type of rest 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.190
 if it's swill right there bottled 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.710
 something called updated dry 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 ordinary 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.369
 kindly moscow on all corners of it 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.350
 sell 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 and if two years 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.360
 tracking the sole of the tropics if vayu 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.500
 just a match with the remnants of juice 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620
 but this drink is already called a wine 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.210
 dry vintage 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.439
 cost two times more expensive order signs yes 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.439
 scores comes true it is much more successful 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.080
 very many people especially girls and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.430
 young women 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.910
 why does she like champagne 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 but how to make champagne do not know 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.640
 but I know 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.380
 with pleasure too 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 will tell 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.770
 I specifically went on excursions to Abrau 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.670
 durso 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 this is the birthplace of Soviet champagne 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.229
 Krasnodar Krasnodar Territory 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560
 champagne is done next 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.070
 original people special 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.420
 green thick-walled 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.329
 a bottle 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.150
 and pour her bouquet of grape juice in 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.609
 five different varieties 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.019
 main grape variety is champagne 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.049
 depending on their ratio of these 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.749
 terms get champagne dry 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.879
 semi-dry semi-sweet 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.459
 trousers 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.519
 five varieties of champagne 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.189
 pour deadlines start the yeast 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.829
 and temporarily fill the bottle with special 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.759
 wooden cork 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.699
 and their mountains have a long reading currency 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.719
 the walls that allen retired for 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.559
 bottles 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.779
 and here they are delivered to the harvest in these holes 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.089
 laid out what they close 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.369
 sealed up 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.339
 year-round adit temperature 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.079
 plus 14 degrees 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.069
 winter does not change in winter 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.479
 and two years in complete darkness and peace 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.019
 these bacteria recycle sugar 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.589
 in this very windowing series a 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.179
 and when two years later the process is already coming 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:05.409
 by the end and it's time the plan is executed 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.859
 they open this data rolls 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.629
 there is a powerful spotlight 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.029
 and cut down the bright and strong mark 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.029
 by surprise and fear 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.379
 these banks 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.699
 City Hall is putting the lip 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.079
 and they from this fear and tray don 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.279
 but before you die the border from 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:26.800
 fear is also called 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.390
 leg gold extracted gas injection pass 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.249
 and that's why niece more 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:35.499
 total champagne prices just these here 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.479
 gases 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.589
 how is it for the face to drink champagne how are they 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:40.939
 us Shibanova 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.680
 but not at all mate is good
