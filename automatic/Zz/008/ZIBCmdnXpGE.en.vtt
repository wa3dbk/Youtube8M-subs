00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it can breathe and count on such I think

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:27.039 
it can breathe and count on such I think
so<00:01:08.760> let's<00:01:08.970> try<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:20.299> spa<00:01:21.860> let's<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:23.130> here

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:36.050 

what<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> sheet<00:01:30.079> okay<00:01:31.369> how<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:35.159> can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
what I was on the sheet okay how you can

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.789 
what I was on the sheet okay how you can
get<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> very<00:01:36.720> small<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:38.180> mouth<00:01:39.180> shut<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:40.290> my

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
get a very small and mouth shut if my

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
get a very small and mouth shut if my
part<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.869> now<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> particles<00:01:44.090> well<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
part is now that the particles well you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.730 
part is now that the particles well you
notice<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.770> result<00:01:46.979> Elaine<00:01:48.740> part

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
notice that the result Elaine part

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.499 
notice that the result Elaine part
effects<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.159> should<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.770> say<00:01:55.799> no

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
effects but you should be as you say no

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.749 
effects but you should be as you say no
but<00:01:57.509> then<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.350> works<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.829> chicken

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.010 

let's<00:02:02.759> see<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.299> there's<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:05.810> cool<00:02:06.810> down<00:02:06.990> i

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
let's see and there's a cool down i

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
let's see and there's a cool down i
think<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:08.640> we're<00:02:08.879> still<00:02:09.090> getting<00:02:09.539> their

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
think but we're still getting their

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.460 
think but we're still getting their
hearts<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.690> shouldn't<00:02:12.959> overuse<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.490 

work<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.650> she<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:23.050> doesn't<00:02:23.410> work<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.710> villagers

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
work so she it doesn't work on villagers

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:39.060 
work so she it doesn't work on villagers
pigs<00:02:29.460> cows<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:34.210> move<00:02:34.660> use<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:38.680> quite

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
pigs cows and move use it quite

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.580 
pigs cows and move use it quite
expensive<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.940> make<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.760> when<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.970> use<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.590> use

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
expensive to make so when you use it use

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.020 
expensive to make so when you use it use
numb<00:02:44.980> big<00:02:45.220> array<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:45.910> line<00:02:46.750> by<00:02:46.960> line<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.030> I

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
numb big array but line by line and I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.450 
numb big array but line by line and I
should<00:02:49.300> note<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:50.320> test<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.980> not

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
should note that this test is not

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.780 
should note that this test is not
complete<00:02:52.300> because<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> shipping<00:02:54.520> could

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
complete because the shipping could

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.930 
complete because the shipping could
maybe<00:02:55.570> stand<00:02:55.960> here<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.350> get<00:02:57.220> red<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.610> then

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
maybe stand here and get red and then

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.970 
maybe stand here and get red and then
the<00:02:58.450> range<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.960> 11<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.680> involved<00:03:00.540> life<00:03:01.980> so

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the range is 11 and involved life so

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.490 
the range is 11 and involved life so
that's<00:03:03.190> something<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> think<00:03:03.640> about<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:05.350> you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that's something to think about when you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.470 
that's something to think about when you
build<00:03:05.680> things<00:03:05.860> i<00:03:06.100> recommend<00:03:06.640> line<00:03:06.880> because<00:03:07.300> i

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
build things i recommend line because i

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.320 
build things i recommend line because i
know<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.810> works<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.970> have<00:03:10.150> any

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
know that works if you have any

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.500 
know that works if you have any
