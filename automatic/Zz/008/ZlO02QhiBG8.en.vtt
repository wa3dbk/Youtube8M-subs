00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.959 

this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> plattekill<00:00:10.950> waterfall<00:00:11.550> right<00:00:11.730> here

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
this is plattekill waterfall right here

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.629 
this is plattekill waterfall right here
the<00:00:12.630> main<00:00:12.900> tube<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> thing<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.130> kind<00:00:14.549> of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the main tube is the thing that kind of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
the main tube is the thing that kind of
comes<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.179> towards<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.630> center<00:00:15.990> there<00:00:16.230> but

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
comes out towards the center there but

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.609 
comes out towards the center there but
so<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.850> stuff<00:00:18.270> might<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.690> easier<00:00:19.230> as<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
so that that stuff might be easier as it

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
so that that stuff might be easier as it
kind<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.890> comes<00:00:20.070> around<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> waterfall<00:00:21.090> but

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
kind of comes around the waterfall but

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.480 
kind of comes around the waterfall but
you<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> stuff<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:22.949> off<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you can see the stuff that's off to the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.660 
you can see the stuff that's off to the
right<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.000> much<00:00:24.600> steeper<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> learning<00:00:26.490> curve

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
right is much steeper the learning curve

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
right is much steeper the learning curve
for<00:00:26.730> climate<00:00:27.269> ice<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.720> actually<00:00:28.260> quite<00:00:28.349> good

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
for climate ice is actually quite good

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.890

rock climbing you can manipulate the ice

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.139 
rock climbing you can manipulate the ice
different<00:00:33.570> than<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.110> rock<00:00:34.910> rock<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
different than you can with rock rock is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.660 
different than you can with rock rock is
very<00:00:36.360> sequential<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.260> ice<00:00:37.920> climbing<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.489> can

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
very sequential and ice climbing you can

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
very sequential and ice climbing you can
basically<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:40.079> hand<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> footholds
