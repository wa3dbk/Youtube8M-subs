00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.230
 no one will come because more than that 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.560

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.120
 a huge horde that I won't be able to 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.370
 manage we have already prepared the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.750
 average figures because when I see them I 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.639
 I turn into an imbecile 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.030

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.520
 hidden because you did n't want to do it 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.490
 to believe 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.980
 I thought I could not talk 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.540

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.510

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.390
