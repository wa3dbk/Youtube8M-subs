upgrade<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.010> bit<00:02:23.190> worse<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.670> my

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
upgrade is actually a bit worse in my

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.190 
upgrade is actually a bit worse in my
opinion<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.210> his<00:02:24.300> normal<00:02:24.600> car<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.930> quite

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
opinion in his normal car just quite

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.860 
opinion in his normal car just quite
strange<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.340> overall<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.420> get<00:02:27.630> that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
strange but overall I kind of get that

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.289 
strange but overall I kind of get that
feeling<00:02:28.140> I've<00:02:28.260> used<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.530> lot<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.700> wasn't

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
feeling I've used a lot and it wasn't

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.539 
feeling I've used a lot and it wasn't
very<00:02:30.330> impressive<00:02:31.080> at<00:02:31.409> all<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.860> storage<00:02:32.280> gets

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
very impressive at all but storage gets

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.880 
very impressive at all but storage gets
through<00:02:32.700> here<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.090> he<00:02:33.510> gets<00:02:33.690> taken<00:02:33.959> out<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.560> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
through here and he gets taken out so it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.589 
through here and he gets taken out so it
is<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> second<00:02:36.120> yellow<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
is going to be a second yellow for the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.360 
is going to be a second yellow for the
guy<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.959> took<00:02:37.080> me<00:02:37.290> out<00:02:37.379> because<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.159> in

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
guy that took me out because it's in

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.440 
guy that took me out because it's in
quite<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.580> good<00:02:38.670> position<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:39.090> was<00:02:39.150> through<00:02:39.390> on

quite a good position I was through on
goal<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:39.810> obviously<00:02:40.590> he'd<00:02:40.769> previously<00:02:40.950> been

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
goal and obviously he'd previously been
