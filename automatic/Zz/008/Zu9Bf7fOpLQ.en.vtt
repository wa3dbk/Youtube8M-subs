00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.159

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.559
 but that's what we talk about that, not 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.390
 because they tell you that you're not going to stay 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.430

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.650
 Peru peru bolivia and as we enter 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.150
 now if we arrived on June 11 in the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.770
 night to brazil why the tears 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.970
 when the first game against Cameroon 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.710
 that exceed even those of the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.020
 tricolor elimination was the feeling 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.090
 on entering the game of cameron I swear 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.150
 I go to court with light and anthem 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.190
 it made me cry it went so much trip so much 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.060
 that you left behind we miss the family 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.680
 and the food that work we give up and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.570
 that feeling was very beautiful and without 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.250
 money have been around for a while so 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.720
 to live the solution is to sing although the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.950
 guitar amplifier that they brought 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.950
 they were swiped in cali colombia 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.290
 I'll take it as if they were the last of 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 this country 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.289
 tacuba coffee everything like a hostel we 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.149
 is sponsoring the costumes then 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.490
 literally after the door of the hostel is 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.410
 the one that has been here we were dealing with 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.750
 leave it at our dinner I lie but as 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.250
 they charged you for 12 hours tried 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.200
 put it in as late as we were 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.670
 awake then I was going out 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.800
 just put it in and I saw that it was 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.780
 open and in addition or me and so I 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.950
 It extends throughout life so I had it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.950
 stolen the broad and mirror 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.940
 then we also have to improvise 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.070
 every policy that stopped us we told them 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.860
 that they just stole from me 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.450
 of stealing now I have eliminated the tri the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.040
 problem will be to return because the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.320
 pockets or real weights or dollars 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.000
 they occupy space work in river maybe in 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.350
 Uruguay or whatever to get a 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.540
 push to return them to the neighborhood 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.580
 we had nothing else to get here according to 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.930
 we reached reach basile nothing 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.900
 more we reach reach Colombia I do not know 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.640
 how a survived but the return 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.130
 we can work in river continue with the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.260
 project and visit children's foundations 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.530
 same in Uruguay in Argentina and in Chile 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.540
 and well now and see if we send the truck 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.440

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.440
 to veracruz and fly hopefully and we can fly
