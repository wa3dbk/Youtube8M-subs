00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
without further ado let's get started

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.810 
without further ado let's get started
okay<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.139> pilots<00:00:16.949> notes<00:00:17.190> then<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
okay so we have pilots notes then on the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
okay so we have pilots notes then on the
top<00:00:18.270> left<00:00:18.750> hand<00:00:18.869> corner<00:00:19.109> by<00:00:19.619> pressing<00:00:20.130> shift

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
top left hand corner by pressing shift

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.140 
top left hand corner by pressing shift
too<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:22.230> says<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> few<00:00:22.800> things<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.340> number<00:00:23.490> one

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
too it says a few things here number one

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.870 
too it says a few things here number one
is<00:00:24.480> ground<00:00:24.779> speed<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> actual<00:00:26.130> speed<00:00:26.430> your

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
is ground speed is the actual speed your

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
is ground speed is the actual speed your
aircraft<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> moving<00:00:27.720> over<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.619> ground

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
aircraft is moving over the ground

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910 
aircraft is moving over the ground
surface<00:00:29.400> okay<00:00:30.390> endurance<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.590> amount<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
surface okay endurance is the amount of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.650 
surface okay endurance is the amount of
time<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.369> aircraft<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.969> fly<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
time your aircraft can fly at the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
time your aircraft can fly at the
current<00:00:33.960> rate<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> fuel<00:00:34.559> consumption<00:00:35.219> take

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
current rate of fuel consumption take

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.569 
current rate of fuel consumption take
into<00:00:36.510> account<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.530> climbing<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.399> your

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
into account as you are climbing to your

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.810 
into account as you are climbing to your
cruise<00:00:38.879> altitude<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:40.379> estimated<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.370> joints

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
cruise altitude this estimated in joints

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
cruise altitude this estimated in joints
will<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.120> less<00:00:42.420> than<00:00:42.719> once<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.620> level<00:00:43.980> off

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
will be less than once you level off

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.279 
will be less than once you level off
throttle<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> settle<00:00:46.200> into<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> cruise

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
throttle back and settle into a cruise

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.060 
throttle back and settle into a cruise
okay<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.350> next<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.950> range<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.420> distance

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
okay so next is range is the distance

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.010 
okay so next is range is the distance
your<00:00:53.070> aircraft<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:54.000> fly<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.660> current

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
your aircraft will fly at the current

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.310 
your aircraft will fly at the current
speed<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.590> rate<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.340> fuel<00:00:56.550> consumption<00:00:57.320> again

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
speed and rate of fuel consumption again

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.619 
speed and rate of fuel consumption again
take<00:00:59.070> into<00:00:59.370> account<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.149> change<00:01:00.329> based

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
take into account this will change based

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.820 
take into account this will change based
on<00:01:00.840> Klein<00:01:01.140> Cruz<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.100> descent<00:01:02.760> operations

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
on Klein Cruz and descent operations

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
on Klein Cruz and descent operations
okay<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.100> fuel<00:01:05.519> economy<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.510> current<00:01:07.170> rate

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
okay so fuel economy is the current rate

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.899 
okay so fuel economy is the current rate
of<00:01:07.770> fuel<00:01:08.250> consumption<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.150> gallons<00:01:09.750> per<00:01:09.990> hour

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
of fuel consumption in gallons per hour

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
of fuel consumption in gallons per hour
alright<00:01:11.909> high<00:01:12.390> temperature<00:01:12.930> warning<00:01:13.140> will

the cockpit as well ok so we have now
the<00:03:02.910> controls<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.810> shift<00:03:04.799> three<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.450> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the controls for shift three so this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.900 
the controls for shift three so this

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.310 
while in external view so if your summer
guys<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.690> would<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> fly<00:03:19.170> on

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
guys if you would like to fly on

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.990 
guys if you would like to fly on
external<00:03:19.620> views<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.160> can<00:03:20.310> still<00:03:20.519> operate<00:03:20.760> all

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
external views you can still operate all

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910 
external views you can still operate all
that<00:03:21.150> information<00:03:21.390> from<00:03:22.019> your<00:03:22.170> cockpit<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.709> on

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that information from your cockpit in on

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.770 
that information from your cockpit in on
the<00:03:23.010> outside<00:03:23.040> view<00:03:23.370> there<00:03:23.730> ok<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.329> next<00:03:24.600> we

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the outside view there ok so next we

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.410 
the outside view there ok so next we
have<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> payload<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.920> fuel<00:03:26.250> manager<00:03:26.730> by

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
have the payload and fuel manager by

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.979 
have the payload and fuel manager by
pressing<00:03:27.780> shift<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.160> bring<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.489> up

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
pressing shift for you can bring this up

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.410 
pressing shift for you can bring this up
ok<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> real-time<00:03:32.609> payload<00:03:33.269> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
ok so this is a real-time payload and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.360 
ok so this is a real-time payload and
fuel<00:03:33.720> monitor<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.260> allows<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.069> visually

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
click on load your aircraft so therefore

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.830 
click on load your aircraft so therefore
you<00:03:38.400> can<00:03:38.519> actually<00:03:38.670> load<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.120> these<00:03:39.239> services

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
you can actually load up these services

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.330

initially is prepared for a standard

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.920 
initially is prepared for a standard
flight<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.430> also<00:04:05.730> all<00:04:05.880> comes<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.660> with<00:04:06.780> the
