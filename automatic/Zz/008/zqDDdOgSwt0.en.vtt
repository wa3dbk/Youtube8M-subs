00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
of jumping into these copper heat fins

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.009 
of jumping into these copper heat fins
and<00:02:24.519> all<00:02:24.879> these<00:02:25.000> nice<00:02:25.269> copper<00:02:25.569> heat<00:02:25.810> pipes

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
and all these nice copper heat pipes

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.270 
and all these nice copper heat pipes
right<00:02:26.200> here<00:02:26.379> everybody's<00:02:26.769> kinda<00:02:26.980> using<00:02:27.160> that

design<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.390> their<00:02:28.510> new<00:02:28.629> design<00:02:28.750> with

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
design this is their new design with

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.630 
design this is their new design with
their<00:02:29.349> wind<00:02:29.620> force<00:02:29.860> cooling<00:02:30.220> as<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.400> stated

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
their wind force cooling as I stated

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.240 
their wind force cooling as I stated
earlier<00:02:31.379> it's<00:02:32.379> a<00:02:32.440> really<00:02:32.620> nice<00:02:32.769> car<00:02:33.069> has

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
earlier it's a really nice car has

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.220 
earlier it's a really nice car has
almost<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.700> vapor-x<00:02:34.060> cooling<00:02:34.569> I'm<00:02:35.019> gonna

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
almost like vapor-x cooling I'm gonna

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.479 
almost like vapor-x cooling I'm gonna
try<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.410> spin<00:02:35.709> around<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.190> guys<00:02:36.280> get<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
try to spin around so you guys get a

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.509 
try to spin around so you guys get a
really<00:02:36.700> good<00:02:36.790> look<00:02:36.879> at<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.060> side<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.390> card
