00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and you run it to the quarter mile that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.330 
and you run it to the quarter mile that
you<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.480> working<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
you do that this all working for that

you do that this all working for that
it's<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:02.879> good<00:01:03.239> order<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.280> prior<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's a very good order now prior to this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's a very good order now prior to this
we<00:01:05.880> might<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.180> used<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> racing<00:01:06.900> oil<00:01:07.049> right

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770 
flat down the track that kind of thing
it'll<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.790> good<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.000> those<00:01:54.299> two

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it'll be good for those two

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.100 
it'll be good for those two
but<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> only<00:01:55.350> 5,000<00:01:56.159> miles<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.810> year

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
but it's only 5,000 miles or one year

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.770 
but it's only 5,000 miles or one year
now<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.409> nice<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.920> set<00:01:59.189> one

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
now it's nice that they set one

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.050 
now it's nice that they set one
six<00:01:59.960> months<00:02:00.380> because<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.310> formulated<00:02:01.670> in

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
six months because it's formulated in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.869 
six months because it's formulated in
the<00:02:02.150> year<00:02:02.330> will<00:02:02.510> not<00:02:02.540> hurt
