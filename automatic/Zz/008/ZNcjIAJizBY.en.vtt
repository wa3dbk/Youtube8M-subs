00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.779
 circle tv and today we will talk about such 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 car asasu 57 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.590
 and I will have for you specifically 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.360
 gift but tomorrow honored video on 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 this machine in full stock it is so 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.260
 it's terrible that I didn't just spit 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
 exorbitant, I never imagined something 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.520
 what could be in the east 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.380
 misery but to you once again 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.660
 so suddenly not to take away from the beautiful 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 branches from a beautiful car in the top I 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 I decide to first put the video on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 the top configuration of this machine and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.800
 after that the next day I will show 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 you all the suffering and all the teachings on it in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.250
 stock because there really is everything 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.350
 pretty sad and so what do we have 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.629
 in the top as you see the dynamics just 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 great 45 maybe maximal 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.969
 but but she drives the car quickly because 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.660
 she is very very light she weighs 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.390
 literally 5 6 tons and it is very small 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.670
 armor we have 6 millimeters funny us 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.100
 blows all types of tanks with land mines 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.250
 usually opponents do not shoot bombs 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.260
 but in any case should be afraid, and certainly 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 definitely not for any miracle ricochets and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.850
 no penetration should not count 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.890
 the armor of this car can only be dad 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 wipe excuse me because her 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.430
 there is simply no yes and cutting 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 open in general beee not want but 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.140
 here did not lose with the instrument to break through 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 160 millimeters may not be so 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 much but at the sixth level it is quite 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 adequate breakthrough may not be the most 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.950
 big one-time damage 100 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.700
 units but rate of fire 2.8 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 seconds and good mix 2.9 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.770
 of course it is recommended to put here 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.329
 aiming and stabilizer drives 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 be sure to think about putting 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.409
 rammer and or not better not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.450
 because the rate of fire and so wild 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 well and if you will be reduced longer than 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 recharge no sense from this 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.329
 to shoot milk is also a little joy also 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.810
 Spending money on shells is easy 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.119
 wasted therefore put on this car 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.070
 better all on note this is a stabilizer 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.530
 this drives aiming it compute or 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.460
 trajectories to that kind of thing and on 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.619
 overview 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.990
 on you can put the module necessarily my 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.420
 father said be sure to put 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.040
 module on a review on how it will help 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.870
 you unleash this potential data 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.470
 better machines are very, very 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 small and very inconspicuous nimble and in 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.890
 general such a flea which hurts 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.660
 bite ambush best tactics 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.380
 on her this how to act along with 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.600
 bipod 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.790
 or surreptitously gnaw as you see in 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.770
 this fight i do when opponents 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 distracted I give them a pink walk on 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.520
 distracts me and at this time gives 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.350
 Pendel them ally not distracted in 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.720
 ally and they give it to Andy Ulyan 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.120
 or more it turns out here such 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.380
 here is the tactic is very suitable asus is very 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.660
 I want to note that the instrument 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.519
 goes down just gorgeous you can 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.500
 shoot such mountains from which you and not 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.000
 dreamed just yes and milestone but in principle 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.980
 also good to raise but not from 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
 outstanding achievements of other machines too 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.350
 all this in order but down very well 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.780
 you're very good at dropping guns and this 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.120
 Of course, plus and this machine 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 plus is of course speed 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.019
 and indeed the guns are generally very nice 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.420
 and speedy just to eerie and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.170
 able to post opponents just 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.620
 once or twice 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.750
 the gameplay on it is very nice yes it can 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.060
 to be no armor but not so important if 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.000
 you want fun then this car 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.640
 just perfect for you she quickly 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.400
 rides quickly shoots for storage and 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.470
 what kind of armor but here is the battle foil just 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.750
 wonderful so we won't 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.459
 be distracted by it we will drive on the map 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 inflict crazy damage from there from 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.720
 where we were not expected to constantly change 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.950
 what positions are 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.299
 snipers with some speed 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.120
 sniper rifle 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.120
 we run everywhere on the map put the enemy 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.130
 lyuley big big basket of people but 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.550
 they won't thank you for it but we 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.160
 the prince and him 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.440
 ACS is generally defined by the machine 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.240
 which is worth pumping up in stock you 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.780
 you will simply not water from it 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.720
 I know how but in general the car turns out 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.550
 top wonderful well as of course and 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.840
 the branch itself is quite interesting and 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.870
 unusual if you really want 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.520
 something like that but you don't 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.290
 you decide there is nothing to do uchudit 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.660
 real life then asu is suitable for 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.460
 experiments for experiments in the game and 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.250
 and it will perfectly lift you up 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.769
 mood and your silver reserves 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.750
 because as far as she is also wonderful 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.970
 especially in such battles where you could 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.900
 good good ride and fill 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.450
 not bad 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.120
 damage with data machines make it easier 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.250
 simple edge you kvass which times 15 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.830
 seconds pushed and missed and left for 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.780
 wall so go ahead buy 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.340
 pump over I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.950
 this video and you will wait for the post 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.870
 sensible hell and torment but with you 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.380
 canu finished of course lucky you 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.380
 bend
