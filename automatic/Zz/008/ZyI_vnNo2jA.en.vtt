00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
I use my little pH reader to test the pH

I use my little pH reader to test the pH
this<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.300> very<00:01:46.170> important<00:01:46.800> because<00:01:46.920> good

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
this is very important because good

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.330 
this is very important because good
quality<00:01:47.880> hydrosols<00:01:48.630> need<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> pH

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
quality hydrosols need to have a pH

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.180 
quality hydrosols need to have a pH
between<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:51.270> four<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.170> five<00:01:52.590> point<00:01:52.950> five

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
between about four and five point five

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
once it starts getting higher than five

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.220 
once it starts getting higher than five
point<00:01:55.890> five<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.430> may<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.760> more<00:01:57.540> water<00:01:57.900> than

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
Hydra song and also it won't have it's

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.960 
Hydra song and also it won't have it's
good<00:02:02.820> keeping<00:02:03.360> qualities<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.700> checking

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
good keeping qualities so I'm checking

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.370 
good keeping qualities so I'm checking
my<00:02:06.390> pH<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:09.360> seeping<00:02:09.600> at<00:02:10.080> around

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
my pH now and it's seeping at around

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.490 
my pH now and it's seeping at around
four<00:02:11.010> point<00:02:11.310> nine<00:02:11.600> five<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:13.140> I'm<00:02:13.230> quite<00:02:13.440> happy

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
four point nine five so I'm quite happy
