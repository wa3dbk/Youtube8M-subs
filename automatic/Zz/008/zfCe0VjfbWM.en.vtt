think<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> sort<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.850> from

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
think I think the the the sort of from

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.880 
think I think the the the sort of from
what<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.090> seeing<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.840> slight<00:01:40.380> older

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
what I'm seeing and the slight older

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.469 
what I'm seeing and the slight older
generation<00:01:41.430> seems<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> had<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> worse

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.740 
and there's like a younger sort of new

him<00:02:46.480> well<00:02:46.780> very<00:02:47.320> totally<00:02:48.190> there<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.430> that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
him well very totally there is that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.150 
him well very totally there is that
there<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.880> an<00:02:49.030> argument<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
there is an argument for that but you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.650 
there is an argument for that but you
know<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.310> think<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.820> goes<00:02:51.910> beyond<00:02:52.240> just<00:02:52.330> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
know I think it goes beyond just the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.200 
know I think it goes beyond just the
sort<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.280> vulnerable<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.490> say<00:02:54.880> maybe

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
sort of a vulnerable and say maybe

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.360 
sort of a vulnerable and say maybe
slightly<00:02:55.510> physically<00:02:56.050> weaker<00:02:56.530> character

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
slightly physically weaker character

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.010 
slightly physically weaker character
that<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.880> only<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.390> person<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.720> gets<00:02:58.780> picked

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
that is only the person that gets picked

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.870 
that is only the person that gets picked
on<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.230> think<00:02:59.350> in<00:03:00.010> our<00:03:00.160> culture<00:03:00.520> especially<00:03:00.610> in

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
on I think in our culture especially in

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.640 
on I think in our culture especially in
England<00:03:01.210> we<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:02.020> problem

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
England we have a problem

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.800 
England we have a problem
we're<00:03:02.950> not<00:03:03.010> problem<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.880> laddish<00:03:04.510> got<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
we're not problem the laddish got the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.640 
we're not problem the laddish got the
reason<00:03:04.930> why<00:03:05.050> I'm<00:03:05.110> doing<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.350> for<00:03:05.470> boys

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
reason why I'm doing this for boys

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.230 
reason why I'm doing this for boys
because<00:03:05.950> there's<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.340> laddish<00:03:06.700> culture<00:03:07.090> of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
because there's this laddish culture of

because there's this laddish culture of
banter<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.470> have<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.400> locker<00:03:09.640> room<00:03:09.910> sort

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.670 
of jokes and I think what are the joke
but<00:03:13.060> my<00:03:13.780> point<00:03:13.960> is<00:03:14.110> though<00:03:14.320> with<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
but my point is though with it is that

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.810 
but my point is though with it is that
the<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.660> said<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.020> jest<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:17.980> then<00:03:18.160> two

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
the it's all said in jest but then two

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.380 
the it's all said in jest but then two
boys<00:03:19.330> find<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.690> difficult<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.020> then<00:03:20.170> bring<00:03:20.440> up

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
boys find it difficult to then bring up

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.850 
boys find it difficult to then bring up
if<00:03:22.390> they've<00:03:22.840> kind<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.200> feel<00:03:23.410> actually<00:03:23.740> it's

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
if they've kind of feel actually it's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.500 
if they've kind of feel actually it's
gone<00:03:23.980> going<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.400> little<00:03:24.460> bit<00:03:24.640> deeper<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:25.270> hard

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
gone going a little bit deeper it's hard

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.790

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
the difference between taking the mick

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.030 
the difference between taking the mick
having<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.020> bit<00:03:50.140> of<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.290> joke<00:03:50.500> between<00:03:50.620> friends

having a bit of a joke between friends
and<00:03:51.100> what<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.370> bullying<00:03:51.670> bullying<00:03:52.240> has<00:03:52.480> three

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
and what is bullying bullying has three

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.690 
and what is bullying bullying has three
elements<00:03:53.170> it's<00:03:53.380> repetitive<00:03:54.010> it's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
elements it's repetitive it's

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.190 
elements it's repetitive it's
intentional<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.600> there's<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:55.990> power

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
intentional and there's a power

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.590 
intentional and there's a power
imbalance<00:03:56.770> between<00:03:56.950> two<00:03:57.490> parties<00:03:57.970> or<00:03:58.120> two

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
imbalance between two parties or two

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.420 
imbalance between two parties or two
individuals<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.590> have<00:03:59.710> done<00:03:59.860> all<00:04:00.040> three

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
individuals and you have done all three

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.980 
individuals and you have done all three
for<00:04:00.670> that<00:04:00.760> for<00:04:01.090> something<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.480> bullying

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
for that for something to be bullying

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.840 
for that for something to be bullying
right<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.710> set<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.190> be<00:04:03.340> elevated<00:04:03.760> from

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
right and set it to be elevated from

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.040 
right and set it to be elevated from
just<00:04:04.120> taking<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.450> mick<00:04:04.600> from<00:04:04.780> something

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
just taking the mick from something

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.720 
just taking the mick from something
because<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:05.590> it's<00:04:05.740> intentional<00:04:06.070> repetitive

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
because if it's intentional repetitive

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.340 
because if it's intentional repetitive
but<00:04:07.180> also<00:04:07.420> there's<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.600> power<00:04:07.810> imbalance<00:04:07.900> there

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
but also there's a power imbalance there

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.230 
but also there's a power imbalance there
that<00:04:08.740> person<00:04:08.980> who's<00:04:09.340> weaker<00:04:09.820> in<00:04:10.030> that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
that person who's weaker in that

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.000 
that person who's weaker in that
relationship<00:04:10.600> has<00:04:10.990> is<00:04:11.320> really<00:04:11.709> uncomfortable

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
relationship has is really uncomfortable

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.670 
relationship has is really uncomfortable
is<00:04:12.459> often<00:04:13.030> sort<00:04:13.240> of<00:04:13.300> under<00:04:13.690> psychological

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
is often sort of under psychological

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.590 
is often sort of under psychological
pressure<00:04:14.890> or<00:04:15.160> emotionally<00:04:15.850> tormented<00:04:16.420> and

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
pressure or emotionally tormented and

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.360 
pressure or emotionally tormented and
and<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.410> very<00:04:17.530> difficult<00:04:17.890> for<00:04:18.100> them<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.250> say

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
and it's very difficult for them to say

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.250 
and it's very difficult for them to say
stop<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.060> when<00:04:19.510> they<00:04:19.600> do<00:04:19.660> say<00:04:19.900> stop<00:04:20.109> they're

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
stop and when they do say stop they're

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.750 
stop and when they do say stop they're
not<00:04:20.350> listened<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:20.980> you<00:04:21.340> have<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.549> have<00:04:21.609> all

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
not listened to so you have to have all

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.190 
not listened to so you have to have all
three<00:04:22.060> elements<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.510> think<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.810> be<00:04:22.900> for<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.169> to

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
three elements I think to be for it to

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.450 
three elements I think to be for it to
be<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.680> other<00:04:23.800> thing<00:04:23.890> with<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.280> is<00:04:24.340> that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
be the other thing with this is that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.890 
be the other thing with this is that
it's<00:04:24.700> really<00:04:25.120> not<00:04:25.450> taken<00:04:25.930> seriously

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
it's really not taken seriously

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.499 
it's really not taken seriously
as<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.229> kind<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.680> genuine<00:04:28.130> concern<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:29.030> should

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
as a kind of genuine concern so should

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.629 
as a kind of genuine concern so should
it<00:04:29.540> be<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.900> think<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.680> should<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.979> mean<00:04:31.100> it's<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
it be I think it should I mean it's the

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.100 
it be I think it should I mean it's the
fact<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.030> we're<00:04:32.570> talking<00:04:32.750> about<00:04:32.810> hair

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
fact is that we're talking about hair

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.350 
fact is that we're talking about hair
color<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.710> think<00:04:33.740> people<00:04:34.550> therefore<00:04:34.880> kind

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
color and I think people therefore kind

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.180 
color and I think people therefore kind
of<00:04:35.479> talk<00:04:36.139> about<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.410> with<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.530> bit<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.889> snigger

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
of talk about it with a bit of a snigger
