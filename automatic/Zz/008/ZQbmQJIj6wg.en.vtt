with that as well look I get your point

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
with that as well look I get your point
I<00:00:38.570> yeah<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> Middle<00:00:39.989> East<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.950> place<00:00:41.640> which

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I yeah the Middle East is a place which

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.260 
I yeah the Middle East is a place which
is<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.379> turmoil<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:44.730> been<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
is in which is in turmoil has been for a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
is in which is in turmoil has been for a
while<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.440> depends<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
while but I think it depends on what the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
while but I think it depends on what the
nature<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.140> particular

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
nature of it is and in this particular

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.819 
nature of it is and in this particular
case<00:00:49.800> by<00:00:50.789> backing<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.780> opposition<00:00:52.350> side<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
case by backing the opposition side of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.290 
case by backing the opposition side of
Syria<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> trying<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> understand<00:00:54.989> them

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
Syria and trying to understand them

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.510 
Syria and trying to understand them
you're<00:00:57.300> able<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.840> bear<00:00:58.289> affect<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.100> outcome

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you're able to bear affect the outcome

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.250 
you're able to bear affect the outcome
in<00:00:59.670> Syrian<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> Assad<00:01:00.840> regime<00:01:01.109> is

would be a major blow for Iran's ability

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
would be a major blow for Iran's ability

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to project its power the region so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
to project its power the region so
strategically<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.650> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
strategically I think this is one of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370 
strategically I think this is one of
these<00:01:32.130> times<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.610> our<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:33.420> our<00:01:33.540> values<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
these times when our when our values and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
these times when our when our values and
our<00:01:34.500> interests<00:01:34.860> line<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
our interests line up now how you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.440 
our interests line up now how you
achieve<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.320> another<00:01:37.500> matter<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
achieve that is another matter and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.670 
achieve that is another matter and
that's<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.229> Syria<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that's but because Syria is so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
that's but because Syria is so
complicated<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.700> reason<00:01:42.000> why<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.240> taken

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
complicated is the reason why it's taken

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
complicated is the reason why it's taken
so<00:01:42.570> long<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> administration<00:01:44.250> to
