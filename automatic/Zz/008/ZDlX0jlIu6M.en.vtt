well<00:01:36.500> Casey<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.220> course<00:01:37.460> absolutely<00:01:37.909> rolled

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
well Casey of course absolutely rolled

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.780 
well Casey of course absolutely rolled
the<00:01:39.229> past<00:01:39.470> two<00:01:39.680> weeks<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.100> they<00:01:40.220> did<00:01:40.369> dominate

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
the past two weeks but they did dominate

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.130 
the past two weeks but they did dominate
two<00:01:40.970> teams<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.630> know<00:01:41.750> we're<00:01:41.840> having<00:01:41.930> a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
two teams that you know we're having a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.410 
two teams that you know we're having a
lot<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.320> problems<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.799> little<00:01:43.009> bit<00:01:43.100> suspect<00:01:43.420> you

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
lot of problems a little bit suspect you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.330 
lot of problems a little bit suspect you
know<00:01:44.540> Indianapolis<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.500> course<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.920> playoff

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
know Indianapolis of course is a playoff

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.340 
know Indianapolis of course is a playoff
team<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.700> bit<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> different<00:01:47.720> situation<00:01:47.869> here

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
team a bit of a different situation here

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.080 
team a bit of a different situation here
although<00:01:48.740> Indianapolis<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.790> know<00:01:49.909> they've

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
although Indianapolis you know they've

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.460 
although Indianapolis you know they've
been<00:01:50.119> hit<00:01:50.360> hard<00:01:50.600> by<00:01:50.689> injuries<00:01:51.170> they're

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
been hit hard by injuries they're

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.960 
been hit hard by injuries they're
already<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> playoffs<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.790> know<00:01:52.909> you

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
already in the playoffs so you know you

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.819 
already in the playoffs so you know you
can<00:01:53.060> pretty<00:01:53.329> much<00:01:53.420> assume<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.799> know

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
can pretty much assume that you know

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.080 
can pretty much assume that you know
they're<00:01:55.130> going<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.310> be<00:01:55.430> looking<00:01:55.460> towards<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
they're going to be looking towards the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.819 
they're going to be looking towards the
playoffs<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.689> maybe<00:01:56.930> not<00:01:57.140> giving<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.710> know<00:01:57.799> a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
playoffs and maybe not giving you know a

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.219 
playoffs and maybe not giving you know a
full<00:01:58.189> effort<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:58.700> these<00:01:59.240> these<00:01:59.719> next<00:02:00.110> two

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
full effort in these these next two

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.560 
full effort in these these next two
weeks<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:01.610> know<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.270> know<00:02:02.299> if

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
weeks and you know so you know if

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.480 
weeks and you know so you know if
Indianapolis<00:02:03.409> comes<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:03.799> here<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.159> just<00:02:04.250> kind

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
Indianapolis comes in here and just kind

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.010 
Indianapolis comes in here and just kind
of<00:02:04.549> males<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.299> looking<00:02:05.630> ahead<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
of males it in looking ahead to the

of males it in looking ahead to the
playoffs<00:02:06.469> then<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.100> guess<00:02:07.310> que<00:02:07.520> si<00:02:07.579> minus<00:02:07.969> six

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
playoffs then I guess que si minus six

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.630 
playoffs then I guess que si minus six
and<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.479> half<00:02:08.509> or<00:02:08.810> seven<00:02:09.200> at<00:02:09.380> home<00:02:09.619> has<00:02:10.399> good

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
and a half or seven at home has good

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.670 
and a half or seven at home has good
value<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.060> totals<00:02:11.390> also<00:02:11.660> 44<00:02:12.170> which<00:02:12.290> has<00:02:12.500> gone

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
value the totals also 44 which has gone

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.920 
value the totals also 44 which has gone
up<00:02:12.829> significantly<00:02:13.010> since<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.030> opener<00:02:14.329> of<00:02:14.390> 41

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
up significantly since the opener of 41

up significantly since the opener of 41
and<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.110> half<00:02:15.230> what<00:02:15.410> do<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.650> your<00:02:15.799> Scott

it<00:02:57.290> plays<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:57.860> really<00:02:58.160> good<00:02:58.370> teams<00:02:58.610> late<00:02:59.060> in

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
it plays on really good teams late in

this<00:03:02.630> situation<00:03:02.900> with<00:03:03.440> Denver<00:03:03.769> over

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
they did this against i guess if San

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.310 
they did this against i guess if San
Diego<00:04:17.150> defense<00:04:17.539> which<00:04:17.660> isn't<00:04:17.959> great<00:04:18.019> in<00:04:18.260> a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
Diego defense which isn't great in a

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.870 
Diego defense which isn't great in a
Denver<00:04:18.620> defense<00:04:18.979> which<00:04:19.130> maybe<00:04:19.370> isn't<00:04:19.579> great

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
Denver defense which maybe isn't great

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.789 
Denver defense which maybe isn't great
either<00:04:19.910> but<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.780> Indy<00:04:20.989> defense<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.440> not<00:04:21.590> good

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
either but the Indy defense is not good

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.560 
either but the Indy defense is not good
either<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.520> think<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.240> know<00:04:23.330> in<00:04:23.479> a

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
either so I think you know in a

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.210 
either so I think you know in a
combination<00:04:24.110> with<00:04:24.560> with<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.860> strong

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
combination with with the strong

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.580 
combination with with the strong
situation<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.240> make<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.960> number<00:04:27.200> six<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
situation I make the number six and a

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.990 
situation I make the number six and a
half<00:04:27.620> seven<00:04:28.039> points<00:04:28.340> i<00:04:28.400> think<00:04:28.610> we're<00:04:28.729> firing

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
on the line and then you combine that

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.260 
on the line and then you combine that
with<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.190> Indy<00:04:31.460> teen<00:04:31.669> but<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.000> you<00:04:32.120> said

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270

they may just kind of mail it in a
little<00:04:33.710> bit<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.760> they've<00:04:35.360> just<00:04:35.390> played

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
little bit and they've just played

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.380 
little bit and they've just played
horrible<00:04:36.169> when<00:04:36.349> they've<00:04:36.470> stepped<00:04:36.650> up<00:04:36.860> to

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
horrible when they've stepped up to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.800

the<00:04:39.200> road<00:04:39.350> this<00:04:39.530> year<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.950> think<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.400> fiction

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
the road this year I think the fiction

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.670 
the road this year I think the fiction
that<00:04:40.730> 47<00:04:41.120> ends<00:04:41.419> up<00:04:41.510> being<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.720> cheap<00:04:41.900> number<00:04:42.260> and

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
that 47 ends up being a cheap number and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.800 
that 47 ends up being a cheap number and
Kansas<00:04:43.040> City's<00:04:43.250> not<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.400> roll<00:04:43.639> right<00:04:43.669> now<00:04:43.850> and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
Kansas City's not a roll right now and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.960 
Kansas City's not a roll right now and
if<00:04:44.900> they<00:04:44.990> can<00:04:45.169> score<00:04:45.380> 30<00:04:45.740> 32<00:04:46.040> points<00:04:46.520> again<00:04:46.730> i

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
if they can score 30 32 points again i

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.000 
if they can score 30 32 points again i

quickly<00:04:58.460> what<00:04:58.700> do<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:58.820> think<00:04:59.000> about<00:04:59.060> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
quickly what do you think about the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.820 
quickly what do you think about the
total<00:04:59.660> because<00:04:59.870> i<00:04:59.990> looked<00:05:00.230> at<00:05:00.350> this<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.710> know

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
total because i looked at this you know

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.950 
total because i looked at this you know
i<00:05:01.040> actually<00:05:01.250> bet<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.760> over<00:05:01.940> at<00:05:02.210> 42<00:05:02.690> not

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
i actually bet the over at 42 not

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.030 
i actually bet the over at 42 not
because<00:05:03.260> i<00:05:03.350> thought<00:05:03.470> it<00:05:03.620> was<00:05:03.680> necessarily

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
because i thought it was necessarily

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.530 
because i thought it was necessarily
good<00:05:04.280> bet<00:05:04.460> but<00:05:04.580> because<00:05:04.790> i<00:05:04.820> was<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:05.180> sure<00:05:05.389> the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
good bet but because i was so sure the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.180 
good bet but because i was so sure the
total<00:05:05.840> was<00:05:05.900> going<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.110> go<00:05:06.230> up<00:05:06.470> because<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.860> you

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
total was going to go up because of you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.010 
total was going to go up because of you
know<00:05:07.280> like<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.760> said<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:08.030> change<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.450> kc<00:05:08.660> how

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
know like you said the change in kc how

know like you said the change in kc how
explicitly<00:05:09.590> been<00:05:09.770> on<00:05:09.950> offense<00:05:10.669> recently<00:05:11.180> now

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
it's up to 44 i think i think in this

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.400 
it's up to 44 i think i think in this
game<00:05:14.510> I<00:05:14.540> mean<00:05:14.810> what<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.050> always<00:05:15.139> have<00:05:15.320> to

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
game I mean what you always have to

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.960 
game I mean what you always have to
worry<00:05:15.530> about<00:05:15.620> in<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.130> applicants<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.850> them

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
worry about in the applicants to them

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.879 
worry about in the applicants to them
you<00:05:17.060> know<00:05:17.210> although<00:05:17.720> most<00:05:18.290> all<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:18.680> game

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
you know although most all that game

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.800 
you know although most all that game
down<00:05:19.100> and<00:05:19.490> then<00:05:19.610> I'm<00:05:19.760> kind<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.060> mammography<00:05:20.360> go

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
down and then I'm kind of mammography go

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.390 
down and then I'm kind of mammography go
through<00:05:21.050> go<00:05:21.350> through<00:05:21.380> their<00:05:21.680> office<00:05:22.010> but

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
through go through their office but

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.560 
through go through their office but
honest<00:05:22.580> you<00:05:22.669> think<00:05:22.850> it<00:05:22.940> behind<00:05:23.270> they're<00:05:23.450> not

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
honest you think it behind they're not

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.330 
honest you think it behind they're not
going<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.780> be<00:05:23.870> able<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.080> do<00:05:24.200> that<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.680> don't<00:05:25.070> see

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
going to be able to do that I don't see

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.890 
going to be able to do that I don't see
Kansas<00:05:25.550> City<00:05:25.850> slowing<00:05:26.180> enough<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:26.540> mean<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
Kansas City slowing enough I mean I

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.270 
Kansas City slowing enough I mean I
think<00:05:27.080> they'll<00:05:27.380> just<00:05:27.560> keep<00:05:27.680> going<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.130> it's

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
think they'll just keep going and it's

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.820 
think they'll just keep going and it's
kind<00:05:28.940> of<00:05:29.000> Andy<00:05:29.240> Reid<00:05:29.419> style<00:05:29.720> I<00:05:29.870> think<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.350> and

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
kind of Andy Reid style I think and and

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.320 
kind of Andy Reid style I think and and
they're<00:05:31.430> kind<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.669> moving<00:05:31.850> along<00:05:32.090> right<00:05:32.270> now

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
they're kind of moving along right now

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.460 
they're kind of moving along right now
why<00:05:32.720> would<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:32.960> want<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.139> break<00:05:33.290> that

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
why would you want to break that

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.290 
why would you want to break that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
momentum it you know I like at this

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.580 
momentum it you know I like at this
