00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.879
 hello welcome to our choice chain 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.600
 of parents today we take you 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.070
 in an amazing world the world and 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.259
 it's a very Gothic universe like 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.700
 you can see on them on these dolls 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.290
 so has complained of dolls 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.210
 that it seems a little bit to 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.000
 barbies even in a very black universe 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.830
 this is the end monster winter here 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.410
 tell you and it's going a lot of success 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.150
 so if you have girls between 6 and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.420
 10 years you will necessarily hear 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.560
 speak 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.939
 we will immediately show you 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610
 exactly what it's all about 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.589
 terrible dolls then the huge field 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 they were invented in 2010 actually 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.390
 to create a different range of 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.440
 madam barbie and madam barbie try 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.030
 to be perfect madam 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.920
 that's when they follow like you 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.150
 can see the monsters rice on it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040
 is not trying to look like reality 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.269
 so they can not look like the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.100
 reality because hold these are 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.030
 monster girls of terrible creature 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.180
 we have frankenstein's daughter with her 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.250
 scar in these patients there see one 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.170
 to the daughter of dracula we have the daughter of a 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.519
 werewolf to the letter in which he 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.369
 grow on the side of the mouth 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.020
 in short my a terrible challenge here then 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.910
 compared to barbie so they have 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.610
 stems from a skin color that 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.660
 do not exist are blue green 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.610
 violet they have colors of 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.100
 hair so very colorful and l 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.630
 undresses so much more wacky 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.660
 firewall him more gothic 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.300
 it's really the Gothic universe then 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.610
 the wings are plastic they are 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.380
 articulated unlike barbie they 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 are articulated from all over the hands the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.090
 elbows the knees which allows it to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.770
 this way and so that's nice 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.290
 because it makes them more alive when 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.420
 even to be able to move the head and the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.210
 arm and all that's really the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 hold very well alone so as 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.520
 dolls classic 1 we can 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.050
 Undress and undress 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.610
 especially since they have lots of accessories 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.080
 so suddenly we can really do 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.020
 a lot of things tell us about the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.900
 belt here we can remove the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.520
 earrings and put them back very 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.500
 easily you can take off the clothes 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 it's pretty simple so it's just 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.850
 little scratch actually there that get rid 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.769
 all alone so here I undress and 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.590
 so I'm going to show you this too 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.000
 doll foot to the measurements it seems 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.470
 perfect finally as you can the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.330
 notice it's questionable because it 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.010
 is a little what titles that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.290
 ethics what else then she 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.750
 vehicle painted the goal obviously this is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.830
 to tell millions of stories 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 or so stories of girls who 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.019
 is assumed 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.840
 because they are different 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.220
 are not necessarily very beautiful are 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.590
 defied monsters we told you already 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.790
 but she does not care she's assuming 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.519
 as they are they can 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.170
 say goal is not beautiful ben me I am 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.060
 still maybe very very ugly 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 but it does not matter I assume myself as 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.730
 it's your life your teeth makes this 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.900
 scar 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.570
 yeah but at the same time here we are 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.930
 beautiful like that we assume as we are 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.000
 we are different and it does not matter 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.470
 this is the message denouncing rails for 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.120
 finish on 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.460
 we will still tell you that this is a 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.350
 true universe of monster high ago 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.090
 full of things there are drawings 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.010
 animated course that's of course but 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.750
 also accessories from the games of 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.070
 makeup lots of things had a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.450
 event like something works 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.460
 usually we decline but 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.950
 essence even when the mr has and this 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.080
 are the dolls that they are who are 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.060
 still reveals in the drawings 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.550
 animated much wiser than she has 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.010
 the air like that looks terrible and we 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.480
 do not tie too much fear finally 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.310
 finally then of course when your 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.930
 7 year old girl will come to see you for 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.910
 tell you mom I would like or dad I 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.770
 would like me gothic doll like that who 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.300
 okay you're going to be surprised 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.709
 like all parents because they say 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.920
 waow even so it's scary but 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.990
 it's a little following all the universes 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 fantastic kind twilight genus harry 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.580
 potter etc 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.270
 it follows this trend but here in 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.170
 final is harmless or not or not eh 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.250
 Well, we let you judge a good courage 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.740
 we in any case we will have presented 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.740
