00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.360
 years we are going to solve feels movement exercise of the movement of 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:06.310
 france companies 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.959
 the quarry exercise 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.030
 two raids section of the city have to transmit an act of 105 horses 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.209
 steam 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.900
 the coefficient of friction 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.939
 d 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.080
 of the surface of zone 7 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 but as I am 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 the distance between the axes of bs 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.289
 relations the mission 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.710
 zero point five 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.380
 what it raises to us is calculates the force that will be exerted between the axes 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.900
 between the two countries knowing that citizens can lead to 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.630
 it's fifteen hundred according to be per minute 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.630
 let's start 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.840
 what we are being asked is the strength with which it is sold 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.010
 that should be will be between 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.050
 is the official 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.120
 to the two axes in this sense for what 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.950
 does not exist of the hoisting and can be transmitted 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.310
 the indicated power at the indicated speed 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.660
 per hundred so that the data we have is the power we want 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.040
 transmit are five horsepower 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.050
 is important after remembering the equivalences one gentleman for three 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.290
 attackers are 75 kilograms meter per second 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.540
 two or if we achieve hamilton to have it the whole international system 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.409
 does not walk 725 like 75 so in watts 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 multiply that the five horses of steam 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.200
 p by 785 like 75 and we have a power of 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.760
 three thousand 3 678 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 how does 75 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.160
 the prescient decision 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.790
 p 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.320
 but like that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.310
 the distance between the axes 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.990
 is equal to one meter 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
 in this case as it is about 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.270
 of network decision the exterior after we would have to if to the diameter one more 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.320
 in diameter two parties is one thing 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.329
 the island transmission ratio is zero point five 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.770
 the birds not only of themselves as home and the exit speed lost 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.749
 entry speed 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.789
 and in this case considering the average to 1 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.689
 by one 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.769
 is equal assembled by two as this reason this mission is also 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.629
 equal 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.899
 from one match of two 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.839
 equaled zero with five 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.849
 comes raising easy too is it feels at full speed of the roda 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.499
 driven that is to say the n2 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.670
 to transform enumerated the n2 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.309
 is to equal ekin while 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.009
 revolutions 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:41.759
 per minute 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.959
 for consultations by calling everyone 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.999
 p a revolution 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.359
 two leaks 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.259
 one minute 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.819
 it's 60 seconds so 500 the world's thing and multiply 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.779
 by two 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.949
 p 60 divided 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.540
 1 of the 52 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.549
 eat 36 balearic joseph 1 52 with 36 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.249
 Dalian is 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:15.709
 efe let's see the shadow we need to calculate this xx and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 then turned over we continue doing operations with all this data 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.409
 ps on the one hand remember that the power 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.689
 it's energy party time 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.509
 it's also time for the triangulars and also strive for speed 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.689
 is this his last founded that we want to look on the one hand the strength that 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.689
 is involved in this one minute transmission the throwing 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.449
 vargas fosado friction remembers that it's the same 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.740
 to the quotient vocento pobla 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.390
 normal to the contact surface in this case is to force we orient 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.319
 called fx 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.299
 I'm good because the speed is a linear speed as good as 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.589
 this system from us but it took 2 hours we worked as it looked sambulÃ¡ 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:59.259
 time 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.620
 let's remember that the equation that relates speed or colombo 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.909
 with the ambulance 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.879
 the line of the eel 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.019
 so that this last formula 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.099
 force by speed equals 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.449
 coefficient of friction by force standard contact surfaces co 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.519
 comedy 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.919
 And power 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.990
 clearing this formula the imposing we hold it calculate sx will be equal to the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.289
 power 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.219
 I lived 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:30.219
 of coefficient of friction per omega and that's why 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.120
 of conventional width we have the vocento quotient we have it and now the 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.309
 data we have with varied we know averaged 6 52 with 36 networks per second 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.460
 well, percent 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.350
 colpisa the formula if we know the denied we can see and we have to 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.229
 use 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.639
 the radio 2 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.719
 percent 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.839
 another option would be to state formula 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:00.029
 kayseri equal to the power 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.900
 by the profile of rose entered by omega 2 by r 2 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.180
 and also be equal to the power by the president of vocento by omega one 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.939
 by three rebounds and 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.069
 Well we work with the parameters of the wheel has driven well we work 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.370
 with the to help the driver to 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.710
 in this case well let's clear for a hundred of these equations 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.520
 let's see how much user 2 is and we will use this formula not to hold 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.430
 we see here 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.810
 that diameter 1 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.870
 would be equal to zero as five diameter two 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.030
 it is useless we are in the equation described above of the distance between 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.309
 axes we do not fear that two is equal to one's 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:38.580
 I sent 2 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.919
 Well, we'll have to 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.789
 percent one like five fingers 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.259
 is equal to the dead we will see 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.569
 an instant of two being equal to two matches one to five 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.729
 percent 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.069
 2009 +5 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.089
 the city 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.089
 p one like to 33 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 one as train first period 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.949
 very good and in this case the measures are 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.999
 that's why subway 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.619
 we are interested in working with the radio 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.279
 filmus the previous measurement between two 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:24.039
 I will not doubt the zero point 6 period 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.749
 meters and good and now we can already use this formula we have said fx 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.839
 if the equality between the power 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.809
 we hold that the power is 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:40.270
 remis and being 78 with more than 25 3 thousand 678 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.139
 like 75 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.559
 conscious party of the encouraged the steel as cho 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.590
 the lotion lasted denied 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.409
 52th coma 36 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.370
 i the user know zerocomesiete lions to others and bad 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.469
 to zero 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:58.030
 667 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.030
 let's see the result of this 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.159
 of this operation 3678 as a 75 divided from 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:10.249
 but like rust 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:13.240
 by 152 as 36 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.240
 because that goal as there are two sentences 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.940
 knowing a value of bank mergers in the ssm of 131 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.119
 The 6 169 500 pieces came with the solution 

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.559
 to our problem 161 as to 600 end
