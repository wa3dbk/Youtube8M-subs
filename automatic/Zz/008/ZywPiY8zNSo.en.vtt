00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.199
 games start with 10 places 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.439

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.990
 number nine seems to me but I have 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.620
 small problem place number eight 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.650
 what a jump 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.570
 war what happened in my just 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.350

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.380
 centaur football player in seventh place 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.560

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.340
 it seems but it is not clear this is football 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.400
 hockey parody 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.940

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.710

 that's really cool 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.670
 here it is a turn place number five apparently 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.370
 football players decided to kick the ball across the field 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.260
 too dumb so they decided to replace 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.490
 habitual ball for something more 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.760
 fascinating cup and why not 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.800
 place number four terrifying surprise 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.270
 I still do not cease to torment the question that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.060
 so could it surprise so much 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.170
 giant ball 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.090
 the street during the rain you surely 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.429

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.900

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.590
 football players are increasing by several 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.599
 time no you just look at it like 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.849
 so you can play as a judge 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.870
 his red card can be seen from 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.290
 space in the first place is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.780
 gigantic cheating mayhem nothing 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.390
 foreshadowed trouble say more match 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.790
 started off just fine like here on 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.860
 The field goes out a giant cheat 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.170

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.410
 match

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 play against ten meters 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.530
 football players if the Russian team 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.290
