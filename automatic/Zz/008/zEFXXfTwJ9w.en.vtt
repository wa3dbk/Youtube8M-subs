00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.470
 hello today we are going to make some earrings and 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.440
 I said mini 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.990
 to start we need a bit of 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.990
 black pasta we make a little ball 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.610
 and we crush it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.720
 Y 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.720
 let's make two more but smaller 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.920
 all right 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.920
 let's take this red 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.530
 a bit 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.840
 and we are going to lengthen the ball a little 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 let's go 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.530
 and we crush him a little 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.270
 we take some scissors 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.579
 and we cut in the middle 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.579
 but without separating the two sections 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.579
 now let's mark 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.579
 two lines on each side 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960
 A) Yes 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.530
 what 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.030
 this time 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.700
 let's go back to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.180
 operate 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.180
 ah 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.150
 to the little ears and the little monkey 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.380
 let's do it three times 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.670
 since we have our three ready 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.600
 pieces 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.430
 we are going to 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.430
 to put your dots 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.480
 and we will have something like that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.160
