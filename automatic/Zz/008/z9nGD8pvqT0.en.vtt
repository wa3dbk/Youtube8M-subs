loop there and I think that this waltz
is<00:02:46.660> sort<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.930> easy<00:02:47.260> music<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.940> sort<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.210> falls

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.589 

is<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.190> different<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.330> hard<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
is so different that it's hard to

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.350 
is so different that it's hard to
believe<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.260> same<00:02:56.290> skater<00:02:57.269> she<00:02:58.269> had

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
believe it's the same skater she had

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.910 
believe it's the same skater she had
such<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.569> ferocity<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.349> short<00:02:59.560> program<00:02:59.680> it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
such a ferocity in the short program it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040 
such a ferocity in the short program it
really<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.370> uplifted<00:03:01.209> by<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.390> music<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.900> feel

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
really was uplifted by the music I feel

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.160 
really was uplifted by the music I feel
like<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.379> puts<00:03:02.920> her<00:03:03.010> down<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.190> bit

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.900 

most<00:03:10.470> feel<00:03:10.620> her<00:03:10.770> fault<00:03:11.069> out<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.520> program

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
most feel her fault out of the program

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.460 
most feel her fault out of the program
once<00:03:12.150> she<00:03:12.300> starts<00:03:12.630> missing<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.140> jumps

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
once she starts missing the jumps

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.110 
once she starts missing the jumps
because<00:03:13.830> she<00:03:14.010> knows<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.520> her<00:03:14.760> strength

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
because she knows that's her strength

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.900
