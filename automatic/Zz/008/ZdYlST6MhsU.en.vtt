00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.710
 hi youtube are hypercubes welcome in 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 this new episode of how where 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 when the series where I talk about one 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.470
 certain weapon you choose in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.590
 case in point from the facebook fan page 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.650
 when I offer you some options you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.019
 work and the most voted one comes 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.189
 we say reviewed in the next video 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.219
 first of all this episode as 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.300
 summer noting is aired on Saturday 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.070
 because I'd like to succeed in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 add one more video per week 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.690
 let's see if I can do it without rushing 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.120
 and therefore without making bad videos 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.850
 quality i hope i can make it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 because on Saturday you will have yours 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 content always starting at 2pm 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.090
 so let's see how it goes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.739
 speaking of today's weapon you have chosen 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.620
 from the fan page by voting more than the others 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 lemme 416 a weapon that we already know 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 good from battlefield 3 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.039
 let's start with statistics 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 always taken from the site simtek dot com e 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.030
 we immediately see that the m4 xvi is a weapon 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.890
 with an average fire rate of 750 rounds 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 per minute with a traveling bullet 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.150
 600 meters per second therefore also 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.820
 rather slow if we want is the usual 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.159
 capacity limit of 900 meters the damage 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.210
 initial always 25 is a drop of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.549
 damage starting from 15 meters from 25 to 18 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 18 that the damage it will hold up to 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.939
 kilometric distances for how much 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 it's about his bullets 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.490
 regarding the recoil instead 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 we have a vertical 0.32 and 10.1 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.070
 to the left 0.3 to the right then 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 a slight asymmetry just starting 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.180
 from this asymmetry 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.899
 let's see right away what about 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.820
 accessories might be useful 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.590
 compensator but we'll see later in the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 but now let's talk about when 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.969
 use it from the statistics my four 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.100
 16 prove to be rather versed e 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.079
 I mean go to medium heat of the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.520
 bullet city averages damage 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.710
 same as all the other rifles 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.110
 of assault aside from the ska racca that also 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.739
 less shocks in the issue charger at 31 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.319
 he ska racca has 21 to be able to shoot 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.930
 towards the enemy therefore a weapon indeed 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.260
 versatile and proves it perfectly in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.730
 game 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.790
 we will often see that many weapons have 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.370
 statistics from an excellent weapon then 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.260
 in reality they are not as practical as 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.970
 it looks like a m4 know says okay by either 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.010
 near that the distant is a weapon 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.310
 rather simple to use and that throws 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.420
 down the enemy with a discreet ease 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.459
 what i think is about accessories 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.330
 and the accessories as usual yes 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.769
 divided into merini cane handle e 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.269
 what I can advise you 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.860
 about the viewfinder is always usual 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.629
 reflex or cobra I prefer 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.950
 the latter will at least use it when 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.590
 I will unlock it because what from one 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.030
 better visibility and the coyote and that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.560
 which I absolutely like the most from 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.360
 see and play I'm using it in 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.030
 this time on iss 23 another 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.159
 great weapon for now on this one 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.409
 game you should see a good reflex 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.120
 who still plays his role as 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.769
 takes away a little more screen than the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.659
 cobra then a little more visual 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.510
 busy but nothing at all 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.790
 of evil instead as regards 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.010
 the barrel the grip definitely the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.379
 speech becomes more interesting for the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.590
 cane I noticed that the heavy barrel 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.750
 usually should give 50 percent 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.659
 more precision on the fire 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.640
 automatic and targeted and should 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.430
 penalize slightly recoil 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.290
 increasing the vertical one instead the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.569
 compensator and mouth brakes leaving 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.549
 aside the silencers they damage 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.560
 a little the damage of the weapon makes it a 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.870
 more precise but they hide you from the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.540
 minimum with regard to compensator 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.090
 heavy barrel and mouth brake between me 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.069
 these I choose the compensator and vi 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.110
 I also explain why the mouth brake 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.840
 takes away the vertical recoil but 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.290
 it damages precision on targeted fire 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.310
 while the compensator reduces the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.109
 the horizontal recoil, however, penalizes 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.329
 slightly with regards to new 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.500
 the focus precision instead focuses on the 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.170
 heavy barrel improves accuracy 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.640
 as we have said it is the worst recoil 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.620
 vertical increasing 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.870
 I noticed that regarding 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.579
 heavy barrel even if it is increased 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.669
 the accuracy from distant increase of 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.699
 recoil is high enough to get me 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.009
 prefer the compensator than in this one 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.160
 case serves because the recoil is 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.840
 horizontal asymmetric of 0.3 and 0.1 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.330
 so your weapon will be straighter 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.430
 I also tried the mouth brake and not 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.800
 it seems to me absolutely bad is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.169
 the accessory I used from the goal of 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.830
 this game maybe forward too 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.840
 before 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.389
 and in any case I noticed the recoil 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.400
 vertical practically resets because 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.830
 it is reduced by 15 percent therefore from 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.849
 10 32 we remove a 15 percent means 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.430
 having 10 20025 something similar remains 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.039
 really low and shoot super 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.349
 easy even over 20 25 meters thing 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.169
 which is absolutely not evil for a 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.849
 versatile assault rifle as m4 xvi 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.320
 I suggest you try that too 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.740
 compensator that could go 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.080
 absolutely fine the heavy rod 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.330
 it is perhaps dedicated to whom or to an extreme 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.919
 recoil control but I don't think so 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.050
 absolutely crappy in checking 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.940
 in that of weapons and I must say that 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.970
 it almost seems that even you lose the 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.650
 precision instead of gaining it then 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.300
 this is a bit the setup that it will go into 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.970
 around the handle 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.680
 we have the usual ergo grip grip 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.720
 angled and all the others 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.570
 I prefer that as usual 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.090
 angled because it removes practically in 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.919
 total recoil of the first blow 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.409
 so as soon as you start shooting you have 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.110
 the same precision you will have in everything 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.030
 the charger while wide grip of from a 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.770
 little less is indicated in the shoot while 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.630
 you are running what I do not do 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.430
 usually when I shoot I stop or 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.440
 I even kneel to be 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.180
 just more precise because I remind you 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.789
 which inside battlefield 4 was 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.070
 reinserted the advantage with any 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.009
 weapon to shoot from kneeling in the 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.780
 in this case we have a handicap of three 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.880
 let's shoot on our feet 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.160
 and a half if we shoot kneeling by two 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.630
 if we shoot from lying down then shoot 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.580
 from lying down definitely makes more 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.470
 precise but it takes away time so me 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.090
 I would definitely go to kneel 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.850
 simply an interesting option 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.650
 would definitely put a nice one 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.419
 laser pointer to be more precise i 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.100
 nip fire then on fire from the hip 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.040
 while you are not using the viewfinder 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.800
 but I find that the enemy of individuals 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.480
 really easy and therefore i'm 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.290
 trying to get around without 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.390
 absolutely use the laser sight for 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.490
 as for the m4 16 this was 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.640
 all now it's up to me to say what I think 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.950
 it's a weapon that I've used a lot 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.110
 my second weapon at the moment I find that 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.580
 is actually very versatile and in 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.440
 all those modes like racing 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.690
 conquest where we could find ourselves enemies 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.430
 both neighbors and absolutely distant a 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.350
 20 25 30 meters 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.120
 well it's a truly phenomenal weapon 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.250
 so I suggest you use it 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.620
 especially if you want to ring a little 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.139
 class assault unlock other weapons in 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.120
 waiting to try to use weapons 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.610
 more difficult for this as where 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.260
 when it was all we obviously feel 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.850
 on facebook for the next weapon
