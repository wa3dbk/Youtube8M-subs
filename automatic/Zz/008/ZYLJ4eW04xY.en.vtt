rates<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.060> as<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.300> can<00:04:59.419> see<00:04:59.479> from<00:04:59.720> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
rates and as you can see from the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.540 
rates and as you can see from the
footage<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.349> can<00:05:00.560> be<00:05:00.710> quite<00:05:00.919> heavy<00:05:01.160> at<00:05:01.310> times

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
footage it can be quite heavy at times

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.040 
footage it can be quite heavy at times
but<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.270> doesn't<00:05:02.510> really<00:05:02.630> make<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.020> game

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
but it doesn't really make the game

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.320 
but it doesn't really make the game
unplayable<00:05:03.639> because<00:05:04.639> of<00:05:04.760> course<00:05:05.000> whichever

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
unplayable because of course whichever

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.969 
unplayable because of course whichever
multiplayer<00:05:05.870> mode<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.289> play<00:05:06.409> having<00:05:06.889> the

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
multiplayer mode you play having the

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.620 
multiplayer mode you play having the
expansion<00:05:07.490> pack<00:05:07.669> will<00:05:07.880> make<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.120> whole<00:05:08.389> world

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
expansion pack will make a whole world

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.510 
expansion pack will make a whole world
of<00:05:08.810> difference<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.530> if<00:05:09.860> I'm<00:05:09.979> being<00:05:10.010> honest

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
of difference and if I'm being honest

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.070 
of difference and if I'm being honest
and<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.729> multiplayer<00:05:11.240> mode<00:05:11.510> should<00:05:11.780> only<00:05:11.930> be

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
and the multiplayer mode should only be

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.689 
and the multiplayer mode should only be
played<00:05:12.320> with<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.740> expansion<00:05:13.250> pack<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
played with the expansion pack in the

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.360 
played with the expansion pack in the
console<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:15.199> main<00:05:15.409> question<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:15.949> does<00:05:16.220> the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
console the main question is does the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.040 
console the main question is does the
multiplayer<00:05:16.909> mode<00:05:17.150> beat<00:05:17.360> Goldeneye<00:05:17.870> and

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
multiplayer mode beat Goldeneye and

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.110 
multiplayer mode beat Goldeneye and
frankly<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.770> gets<00:05:18.979> close<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:19.820> doesn't

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
frankly it gets close but it doesn't

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.300 
frankly it gets close but it doesn't
quite<00:05:20.240> feel<00:05:20.479> a<00:05:20.539> solid<00:05:21.050> whilst<00:05:21.860> Goldeneye

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
quite feel a solid whilst Goldeneye

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.980 
quite feel a solid whilst Goldeneye
allowed<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.610> fine<00:05:22.940> balance<00:05:23.300> between<00:05:23.449> stealth

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
allowed a fine balance between stealth

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.680 
allowed a fine balance between stealth
and<00:05:24.199> going<00:05:24.560> all-out<00:05:24.800> guns<00:05:25.220> blazing<00:05:25.789> quake<00:05:26.449> 2

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
and going all-out guns blazing quake 2

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.600 
and going all-out guns blazing quake 2
really<00:05:26.990> relies<00:05:27.320> on<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:27.590> fastest<00:05:28.039> finger<00:05:28.400> wins

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
really relies on the fastest finger wins

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.939 
really relies on the fastest finger wins
concept<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.479> it's<00:05:29.900> quite<00:05:30.080> honestly<00:05:30.409> expect

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
concept and it's quite honestly expect

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.589 
concept and it's quite honestly expect
too<00:05:31.070> cool<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.400> see<00:05:31.580> when<00:05:31.789> four<00:05:32.090> good<00:05:32.300> players

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
too cool to see when four good players

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.480 
too cool to see when four good players
duke<00:05:32.960> it<00:05:33.139> out<00:05:33.229> it's<00:05:33.979> certainly<00:05:34.310> more

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
duke it out it's certainly more

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.399 
duke it out it's certainly more
action-packed<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.360> faster<00:05:35.900> than<00:05:36.020> Goldeneye

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
action-packed and faster than Goldeneye

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.110 
action-packed and faster than Goldeneye
but<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.800> depth<00:05:37.039> isn't<00:05:37.430> quite<00:05:37.610> there<00:05:37.759> to<00:05:37.970> match

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
but the depth isn't quite there to match

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.950 
but the depth isn't quite there to match
it

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
it

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.320 
it
quake<00:05:40.650> 2<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:40.979> definitely<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.669> honestly<00:05:42.120> one

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
quake 2 is definitely and honestly one

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.879 
quake 2 is definitely and honestly one
of<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.539> best<00:05:42.750> games<00:05:42.990> on<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.229> console

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
of the best games on the console

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.740 
of the best games on the console
many<00:05:44.340> people<00:05:44.699> overlooked<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.270> thinking<00:05:45.630> it

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
many people overlooked it thinking it

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.870 
many people overlooked it thinking it
was<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.870> direct<00:05:46.259> port<00:05:46.410> of<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.680> PC<00:05:46.860> original<00:05:47.490> so

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
was a direct port of the PC original so

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.520 
was a direct port of the PC original so
may<00:05:48.060> missed<00:05:48.360> out<00:05:48.509> on<00:05:48.660> this<00:05:48.780> one<00:05:48.990> first<00:05:49.259> time

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
may missed out on this one first time

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.830 
may missed out on this one first time
around<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:50.160> urge<00:05:50.759> you<00:05:50.940> then<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.270> go<00:05:51.419> back<00:05:51.449> and

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
and easy to find on the retro scene is

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.260 
and easy to find on the retro scene is
one<00:05:55.830> which<00:05:56.009> has<00:05:56.160> hours<00:05:56.550> worth<00:05:56.699> of<00:05:56.880> gameplay

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
one which has hours worth of gameplay

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.850 
one which has hours worth of gameplay
and<00:05:57.600> pretty<00:05:57.780> much<00:05:57.960> unlimited<00:05:58.289> amount<00:05:58.770> of

multiplayer<00:05:59.430> awesomeness<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.389> picked<00:06:01.259> this<00:06:01.350> up

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
multiplayer awesomeness I picked this up

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.290 
multiplayer awesomeness I picked this up
on<00:06:01.680> day<00:06:01.860> one<00:06:02.100> but<00:06:02.310> when<00:06:02.460> did<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:02.789> first<00:06:03.000> play

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
on day one but when did you first play

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.999 
on day one but when did you first play
it<00:06:03.479> did<00:06:04.199> you<00:06:04.320> expect<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.860> be<00:06:04.889> another

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
it did you expect this to be another

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.800 
it did you expect this to be another
port<00:06:05.460> like<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.789> original<00:06:06.150> quake<00:06:06.389> when<00:06:06.630> the

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
port like the original quake when the

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.020 
port like the original quake when the
console<00:06:07.229> was<00:06:07.320> released<00:06:07.380> or<00:06:08.190> like<00:06:08.250> me<00:06:08.729> were<00:06:08.880> you

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030
