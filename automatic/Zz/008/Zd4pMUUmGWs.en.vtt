00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.970
 at angie for this tablet blog on the 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.860
 elz ii press conference on the mobile 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.780
 world congress in Barcelona this is the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.050
 first official day and we we 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.400
 the lg optimus pro we have presented 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.079
 quite a bit about the smartphone here 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.759
 Seen now we can finally 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.550
 adjust yourself 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.589
 the lg optimus pro as you see is one 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.300
 55 inch smartphone similar to the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.980
 Samsung Galaxy Note 2 The same 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.710
 display size the resolution is 1920 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.190
 x 1080 pixel is a bollard display 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.660
 the galaxy note 2 had 720p display 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.870
 That's why we have one here too 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.790
 pixeldichte of 400 ps is so completely 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.570
 nice is also a pretty good display 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.040
 I think 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.750
 the views are here from the side 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.380
 sometimes not so good because you 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.460
 from that we have a very clear one 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.850
 display brightness is not a bit 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.210
 but down otherwise 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.070
 Condition is also maxi tomorrow 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.810
 maybe it's a bit dark 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.850
 Here you can see everything 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.619
 Of course, lighting will also be on top 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.670
 we have to look up to 1 real in the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.100
 sun would look like 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.229
 we need more in it also a 1 ghz 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.710
 core core processor is running pretty well 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.180
 briskly 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.920
 there are two gigabytes 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.330
 RAM and 32 GB flash memory 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.860
 well let's go to the lg optimus 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.530
 jersey around 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.630
 we have around here my 2 1 megapixel 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.670
 front camera underneath the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.670
 speakers here below the three 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.119
 typical android companies continue to do business 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.399
 with for usb connection as well as the microphone 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.149
 of course here on the side have that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.259
 we even be so that a 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.580
 intervene but the cover 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.560
 can lose weight 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.700
 there should be synonymous micro SD card slot 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.770
 to be available 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.850
 unfortunately I can I stepped accurate watch 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.520
 early here 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.979
 this is with the fuse on housing run 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.120
 glued and you can still the lid 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.930
 do not make off but good 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.580
 Here we have the power button 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.340
 then up here once an antenna 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 that may either be it for them, though 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.790
 probably more for dvb t dvb t antenna 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.830
 but your south korea seems 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.300
 certainly not in germany so 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.160
 This antenna is likely in Germany 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.830
 at least I do not give it away 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.959
 next to it we have such an infrared then 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.660
 a headset connection on this page 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.300
 a photo button and such a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.580
 volume rocker back we said 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.560
 then the camera with 3 10 megapixel 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.959
 take the led lightning and again 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.530
 a speaker otherwise we are nothing 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.120
 except that lte logo and yes the plastic 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.360
 Surface The housing is completely made 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.210
 plastic 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.780
 is now like the galaxy note 2 too 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.730
 from plastic here everything but it feels 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 Okay, it's pretty easy 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.070
 I do not know now my pulse is a 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.710
 little bit of cover like you 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.780
 So losing weight is not perfect 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.240
 worked but it feels easy 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.730
 good on could say a little better but 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.480
 it okay 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.450
 good as I said 55 inches full HD display 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.430
 that has good education is pretty clear 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.959
 everything and we can see each other 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.080
 software bit we have a look 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.420
 now does not change 4.12 jelly bean yet 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.910
 4.2 but I hope they could 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.959
 if now a final appears and how 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.209
 you see and on which one 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.200
 bit adjusted by lg this 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.910
 we already know each other 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.829
 unfortunately we have no internet right now 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.650
 you can see here so much we can 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.319
 So try me but let's see 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.470
 Of course we are a few now 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.989
 apps is just a gag korea there 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.540
 pre-installed but of course here 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.910
 demi moore notebook app western 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.819
 galaxy note 2 stylus styled gives 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.660
 Of course it is not good that lg 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.940
 by the way, optimus pro with a 3000 140 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.379
 million batteries vacation time should the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.849
 also be ok with the big display 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.470
 lg optimus 7 do a good job 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.239
 obligatory could be from 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.670
 postprocessing to be a bit better 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.290
 but otherwise I think that it is here 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.419
 a decent times fries 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.139
 I am leading the apple blog of many 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.139
 thanks for seeing
