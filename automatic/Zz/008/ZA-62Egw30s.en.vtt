macbook pro laptops it's been a while

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.919 
macbook pro laptops it's been a while
since<00:00:10.130> you<00:00:10.280> seen<00:00:10.460> a<00:00:10.490> macbook<00:00:11.120> pro<00:00:11.389> refresh

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
since you seen a macbook pro refresh

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.150

although<00:00:12.230> at<00:00:12.349> first<00:00:12.380> glance<00:00:12.769> you<00:00:12.920> might<00:00:13.099> think

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
although at first glance you might think

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.919 
although at first glance you might think
these<00:00:13.460> look<00:00:13.490> pretty<00:00:13.849> much<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:14.360> same<00:00:14.480> as<00:00:14.750> the

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
these look pretty much the same as the

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.840 
these look pretty much the same as the
macbook<00:00:15.769> pros<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.129> already<00:00:16.460> know<00:00:16.580> that's

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
macbook pros you already know that's

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.340 
macbook pros you already know that's
because<00:00:17.090> on<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.390> outside<00:00:17.779> they<00:00:17.960> actually<00:00:18.230> are

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
because on the outside they actually are

pretty<00:00:18.590> much<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.920> same<00:00:19.100> there<00:00:19.850> are<00:00:20.029> however<00:00:20.269> a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
pretty much the same there are however a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.170

then on the 15-inch like this model and
the<00:00:52.160> 17-inch<00:00:52.760> there's<00:00:53.630> also<00:00:53.900> discrete

that's<00:01:01.520> kind<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.940> major<00:01:02.240> change<00:01:02.780> there<00:01:03.440> and

that's kind of a major change there and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.250 
that's kind of a major change there and
