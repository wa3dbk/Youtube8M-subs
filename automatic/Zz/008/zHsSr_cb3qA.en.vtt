00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
I should start cutting onions like that

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.149 
I should start cutting onions like that
yeah<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.530> should<00:01:27.020> olive<00:01:28.020> oil<00:01:28.109> is<00:01:28.320> warm<00:01:28.710> and

yeah you should olive oil is warm and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.919 
yeah you should olive oil is warm and
first<00:01:29.909> I'm<00:01:30.210> gonna<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> onion<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
first I'm gonna put in the onion so the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.889 
first I'm gonna put in the onion so the
reason<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.350> start<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> onions<00:01:35.700> first<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
reason we start with the onions first is

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.919 
reason we start with the onions first is
because<00:01:37.380> garlic<00:01:38.009> burns<00:01:38.549> right<00:01:39.479> high

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
because garlic burns right high

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.959 
because garlic burns right high
temperature<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.189> want<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.460> put<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
temperature so you want to put that in
