Lumia 800 and as you can see that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
Lumia 800 and as you can see that
they're<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:28.950> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.330> sort<00:00:30.570> windows

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
they're all on the the sort windows

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.930 
they're all on the the sort windows
phone<00:00:31.080> home<00:00:31.350> screen<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.770> I<00:00:32.399> put<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.699> all<00:00:32.789> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
phone home screen and I put them all to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
phone home screen and I put them all to
brightness<00:00:33.270> low<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.900> so<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.530> good

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
brightness low and so you can get a good

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.520 
brightness low and so you can get a good
idea<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.040> how<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> screens<00:00:36.150> actually<00:00:36.600> reactor

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
idea of how the screens actually reactor

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.110 
idea of how the screens actually reactor
and<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.640> take<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> look<00:00:38.970> at<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> focus<00:00:40.110> s<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
and if we take a look at the focus s and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
and if we take a look at the focus s and
the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.570> you'll<00:00:42.690> notice<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.350> just

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the first thing you'll notice is just

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.620 
the first thing you'll notice is just
how<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.120> finished<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.500> spin<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> over

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
how it's all finished so we spin it over

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.690 
how it's all finished so we spin it over
it's<00:00:48.630> extremely<00:00:49.050> thin<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.890> extremely<00:00:50.340> late

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it's extremely thin it's extremely late

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.540 
it's extremely thin it's extremely late
lightweight<00:00:51.450> as<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> screen

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
lightweight as well so then the screen

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
lightweight as well so then the screen
is<00:00:53.910> fairly<00:00:54.300> good<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:55.290> some<00:00:55.469> decent

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
is fairly good and get some decent

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
is fairly good and get some decent
colors<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:57.630> decent<00:00:58.079> brightness

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
colors on it and decent brightness

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
colors on it and decent brightness
there's<00:00:58.950> a<00:00:59.040> couple<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.399> options<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.910> actually

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
there's a couple of options to actually

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
there's a couple of options to actually
change<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> brightness<00:01:01.440> options<00:01:02.040> in<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> so

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
change the brightness options in this so

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.709 
change the brightness options in this so
you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.550> change<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.360> default

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you can change it with the default

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.800 
you can change it with the default
setting<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:05.030> Samsung<00:01:06.030> we've<00:01:06.179> also<00:01:06.329> added<00:01:06.539> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
setting and Samsung we've also added in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.620 
setting and Samsung we've also added in
sort<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> their<00:01:08.009> own<00:01:08.159> extra<00:01:09.030> setting<00:01:09.359> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
sort of their own extra setting to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.449 
sort of their own extra setting to
change<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.289> display<00:01:11.189> you're<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.299> assuming

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
change the display you're just assuming

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.959 
change the display you're just assuming
just<00:01:14.459> change<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.569> intensity<00:01:16.139> is<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.039> um

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
just change the intensity is there so um

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.959 
just change the intensity is there so um
overall<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.109> bad<00:01:19.229> device<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> edge<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
overall not a bad device the edge of

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.550 
overall not a bad device the edge of
back<00:01:21.329> cover<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.439> pull<00:01:22.679> this<00:01:22.740> off<00:01:23.039> a<00:01:24.560> little

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
back cover if we pull this off a little

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.879 
back cover if we pull this off a little
bit<00:01:25.740> flimsy<00:01:26.249> it's<00:01:26.399> very<00:01:26.639> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.679> looks<00:01:28.679> like

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
bit flimsy it's very you know looks like

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.279 
bit flimsy it's very you know looks like
it<00:01:29.009> could<00:01:29.130> snap<00:01:29.399> quite<00:01:29.759> easily<00:01:29.880> burn<00:01:30.289> other

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
it could snap quite easily burn other

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.349 
it could snap quite easily burn other
than<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.529> it's<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.029> what<00:01:33.179> we're

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
than that it's kind of what we're

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.679 
than that it's kind of what we're
expecting<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.319> focus<00:01:35.249> testing<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:36.479> let's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
expecting and focus testing now let's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.800 
expecting and focus testing now let's
have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.999> focus<00:01:38.999> flash<00:01:40.999> now<00:01:41.999> not

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
have a look at the focus flash now not

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
have a look at the focus flash now not
particularly<00:01:43.139> thin<00:01:43.499> and<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:44.669> compare<00:01:45.029> these

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
particularly thin and we compare these

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.319 
particularly thin and we compare these
together<00:01:46.429> yeah<00:01:48.200> not<00:01:49.200> fin<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:50.069> and

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
together yeah not fin at all really and

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.839 
together yeah not fin at all really and
if<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.419> compare<00:01:51.779> this<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:52.169> be<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:53.399> radar

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
if we compare this to be the radar

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:55.239 
if we compare this to be the radar
finger<00:01:54.179> around<00:01:54.299> about<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:54.719> sort<00:01:55.169> of

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
finger around about the same sort of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.760 
finger around about the same sort of
sort<00:01:56.249> of<00:01:56.279> thickness<00:01:56.669> there<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
sort of thickness there so and the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219 
sort of thickness there so and the
actual<00:01:58.889> build<00:01:59.219> quality<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.849> fairly<00:02:00.840> decent

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
actual build quality and fairly decent

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.129 
actual build quality and fairly decent
so<00:02:01.529> if<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.770> try<00:02:02.039> and<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.299> back<00:02:03.719> cover<00:02:03.989> off

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
so if we try and get the back cover off

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.749 
so if we try and get the back cover off
there<00:02:04.349> let's<00:02:04.979> try<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.209> the<00:02:06.270> corner

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.130 

you<00:02:09.759> can<00:02:09.880> see<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.030> that's<00:02:10.240> like<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.960> think

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
you can see that that's like I think

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.830 
you can see that that's like I think
it's<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.620> fills<00:02:12.280> metal<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> lot<00:02:13.810> more

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
it's that fills metal so it's a lot more

think<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.800> um<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.670> fair<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.910> say<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.240> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
think it's um it's fair to say that the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.220 
think it's um it's fair to say that the

also got the amyloid on both of these so

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.110

here<00:02:59.140> now<00:02:59.770> if<00:03:00.100> we<00:03:00.280> compare<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.020> focus<00:03:02.020> flash

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
here now if we compare the focus flash

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.979 
here now if we compare the focus flash
and<00:03:02.620> Lumia<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:08.410> terms<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.830> fitness<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
things on the focus flash is you've

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.729 
things on the focus flash is you've
actually<00:03:19.600> got<00:03:19.810> physical<00:03:20.230> button<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
actually got physical button on the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.580 
actually got physical button on the
bottom<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.400> that's<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.630> my<00:03:23.170> appeal<00:03:23.440> to

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
bottom there so that's a my appeal to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.850 
bottom there so that's a my appeal to
some<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.239> can<00:03:25.360> see<00:03:25.540> fairly<00:03:25.930> fairly

some so you can see fairly fairly

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.960 
some so you can see fairly fairly
similar<00:03:27.250> sort<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.519> screen<00:03:27.760> size<00:03:29.970> similar

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
thickness able to see the difference the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.030 
thickness able to see the difference the
unlock<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.170> can't<00:03:35.380> read<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.680> battery<00:03:36.010> on

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
unlock you can't read the battery on

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.700 
unlock you can't read the battery on
there<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.299> got<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> cameras<00:03:37.840> over<00:03:37.959> top

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.480 

now<00:03:43.400> compared<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.800> actual<00:03:45.800> radar<00:03:48.490> going

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
now compared to the actual radar going

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.770 
now compared to the actual radar going
facing<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.120> screen<00:03:50.390> size<00:03:51.880> thickness<00:03:52.880> there's

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
facing the screen size thickness there's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.650 
facing the screen size thickness there's
not<00:03:53.900> much<00:03:54.080> between<00:03:54.380> them<00:03:54.740> really<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.300> so<00:03:56.300> down

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
not much between them really and so down

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.230 
not much between them really and so down
to<00:03:56.690> preference<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.460> it<00:03:58.460> will<00:03:58.580> cavale<00:03:58.850> ability

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
to preference and it will cavale ability

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.710 
to preference and it will cavale ability
obviously<00:04:02.590> okay<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:03.670> comparing<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> samsung

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
obviously okay so comparing the samsung

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.310 
obviously okay so comparing the samsung
focus<00:04:06.020> s<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.700> HTC<00:04:08.420> Titan<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:08.990> these

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
focus s and the HTC Titan and these

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.940 
focus s and the HTC Titan and these
obviously<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.510> biggest<00:04:11.560> new<00:04:12.560> windows

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
obviously to the biggest new windows

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.460 
obviously to the biggest new windows
phone<00:04:12.980> 7.5<00:04:13.790> devices<00:04:14.360> available<00:04:15.020> at<00:04:15.410> the

phone 7.5 devices available at the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.040 
phone 7.5 devices available at the
moment<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.700> you'll<00:04:16.850> see<00:04:16.880> on<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.450> focus<00:04:17.870> s

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
moment and so you'll see on the focus s

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.070 
moment and so you'll see on the focus s
we've<00:04:18.260> got<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.380> AMOLED<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.010> on<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.150> HTC

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
we've got the AMOLED and on the HTC

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.250 
we've got the AMOLED and on the HTC
Titan<00:04:21.650> we've<00:04:22.220> got<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.490> super<00:04:23.240> LCD<00:04:23.690> display

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
Titan we've got the super LCD display

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.730 
Titan we've got the super LCD display
now<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:24.980> focus<00:04:25.850> s<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.360> 4.3<00:04:27.050> inch<00:04:27.170> device<00:04:27.380> and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
now the focus s is a 4.3 inch device and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.210 
now the focus s is a 4.3 inch device and
the<00:04:28.670> Titan<00:04:29.240> is<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.420> 4.7<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:30.740> there's<00:04:31.160> a

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
the Titan is a 4.7 so there's a

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.730 
the Titan is a 4.7 so there's a
difference<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.760> screens<00:04:32.330> or<00:04:32.780> size<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
difference in screens or size and the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.280 
difference in screens or size and the
screen<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:35.000> screen<00:04:35.090> quality<00:04:35.450> as<00:04:35.840> well<00:04:35.900> and

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
screen the screen quality as well and

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.470 
screen the screen quality as well and
you<00:04:37.070> can<00:04:37.130> see<00:04:37.370> you'll<00:04:37.670> see<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.910> colors<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.360> the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
you can see you'll see the colors on the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.470 
you can see you'll see the colors on the
focus<00:04:38.660> s<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.710> little<00:04:40.460> bit<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.850> little<00:04:40.940> bit<00:04:41.210> sort

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
focus s a little bit a little bit sort

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.650 
focus s a little bit a little bit sort
of<00:04:41.510> brighter<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.960> little<00:04:42.080> bit<00:04:42.320> bit<00:04:42.890> lighter<00:04:43.160> and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
of brighter a little bit bit lighter and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.730 
of brighter a little bit bit lighter and
again<00:04:44.660> this<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:44.930> pretty<00:04:45.140> down<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.500> preference

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
again this is pretty down to preference

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.570 
again this is pretty down to preference
on<00:04:46.480> over<00:04:47.480> whether<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.260> prefer<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:49.220> amyloid

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
on over whether you prefer the amyloid
