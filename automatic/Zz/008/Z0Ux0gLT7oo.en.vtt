things<00:01:40.910> such<00:01:41.150> as<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.470> think<00:01:42.560> that

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
things such as that so I think that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.200 
things such as that so I think that
means<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.040> unique<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.610> has<00:01:43.790> been<00:01:43.940> unique

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
means it unique and it has been unique

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.070 
means it unique and it has been unique
because<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.420> don't<00:01:44.570> really<00:01:44.690> know<00:01:44.869> anything

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
because I don't really know anything

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.430 
because I don't really know anything
that<00:01:45.350> does<00:01:45.560> exactly<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.160> same<00:01:46.220> thing<00:01:47.290> it's<00:01:48.290> a

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
that does exactly the same thing it's a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.430 
that does exactly the same thing it's a
great<00:01:48.560> practice<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.460> life<00:01:49.850> because<00:01:50.720> life<00:01:50.900> is

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
great practice of life because life is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.710

juggling juggling life that's where they

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.950 
juggling juggling life that's where they
get<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.900> from<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.650> know<00:01:54.740> they<00:01:54.920> thought<00:01:54.950> if
