here<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> if<00:00:40.410> you're<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> mount<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.340> motor

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
here so if you're going to mount a motor

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
here so if you're going to mount a motor
you<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.510> sure<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:43.200> frame

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you have to make sure that your frame

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.490 
you have to make sure that your frame
has<00:00:44.399> enough<00:00:44.789> area<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.930> here

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
has enough area right here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.029 
has enough area right here
this<00:00:47.129> particular<00:00:47.550> frame<00:00:48.239> does<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.770> here's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this particular frame does not so here's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.729 
this particular frame does not so here's
your<00:00:50.160> typical<00:00:50.430> two<00:00:51.090> stroke<00:00:51.449> engine<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.110> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
your typical two stroke engine and you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.639 
your typical two stroke engine and you
can<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> area<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.180> big<00:00:54.449> enough

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
can see that the area is not big enough

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.810 
can see that the area is not big enough
so<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> choose<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.840> your<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.170> frame<00:00:58.820> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so when you choose your your a frame it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
so when you choose your your a frame it
has<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.420> an<00:01:00.600> area<00:01:00.960> that's<00:01:01.020> large<00:01:01.440> enough

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
has to have an area that's large enough

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
has to have an area that's large enough
for<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.039> motor<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> here's<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> close-up<00:01:07.049> look

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
for the motor so here's a close-up look

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.300 
for the motor so here's a close-up look

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.420 
the right side is the freewheel sprocket
sitting<00:03:00.450> backwards<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.319> driving<00:03:01.709> forwards

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.690 

the<00:03:05.430> reason<00:03:05.760> there's<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.000> gap<00:03:06.299> here<00:03:06.620> from

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
the reason there's a gap here from

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.289 
the reason there's a gap here from
between<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.600> dropouts<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:11.760> use<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
between the dropouts and we use the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.129 
between the dropouts and we use the
extra<00:03:12.959> nuts<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.680> make<00:03:13.829> up<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> gap<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.549> because

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
extra nuts to make up the gap is because

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.090 
extra nuts to make up the gap is because
on<00:03:16.139> our<00:03:17.000> flip-flop<00:03:18.000> hub<00:03:18.269> or<00:03:18.870> flip-flop<00:03:19.859> heavy

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
on our flip-flop hub or flip-flop heavy

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.580 
on our flip-flop hub or flip-flop heavy
duty<00:03:20.430> wheel<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:22.430> use<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:24.260> single<00:03:25.260> speed

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
duty wheel we can use a single speed

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.870 
duty wheel we can use a single speed
freewheel<00:03:25.620> sprocket<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.900> might<00:03:28.109> have<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
freewheel sprocket but you might have a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.050 
freewheel sprocket but you might have a
disc<00:03:29.880> brake<00:03:30.150> wheel<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:31.350> accepts<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.340> rotor

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
disc brake wheel that accepts the rotor

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.690 
disc brake wheel that accepts the rotor
on<00:03:33.329> one<00:03:33.540> side<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.170> on<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.319> other<00:03:34.560> side<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
on one side and on the other side you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.479 
on one side and on the other side you
might<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:37.970> 10<00:03:38.970> speed<00:03:39.269> or<00:03:39.599> 15<00:03:40.019> speed

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
might have a a 10 speed or 15 speed

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.960 
might have a a 10 speed or 15 speed
whatever<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.639> is<00:03:42.049> cluster<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.579> sprocket<00:03:44.579> and

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
whatever it is cluster a sprocket and

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.720 
whatever it is cluster a sprocket and
then<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.049> would<00:03:46.260> not<00:03:46.440> need<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.709> make<00:03:47.040> up<00:03:47.220> any

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
then you would not need to make up any

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.680 
then you would not need to make up any
gap<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:51.030> here's<00:03:51.299> just<00:03:51.389> another

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
gap here so here's just another

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.839 
gap here so here's just another
perspective<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:53.010> I'll<00:03:53.400> give<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.669> wheel<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
perspective and I'll give the wheel a

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:02.300 
perspective and I'll give the wheel a
spin<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:58.069> so<00:03:59.069> again<00:03:59.819> this<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.480> a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
spin and so again this is a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.260 
spin and so again this is a
kit<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.569> for<00:04:03.989> people<00:04:04.440> who<00:04:04.620> can<00:04:05.270> customize

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
kit that is for people who can customize

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.370 
kit that is for people who can customize
bicycles<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.440> who<00:04:08.069> have<00:04:08.190> skills<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.730> welding

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
bicycles and who have skills and welding

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.240 
bicycles and who have skills and welding
so<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.830> make<00:04:10.980> necessary

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
so that you can make necessary

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.960 
so that you can make necessary
adjustments<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.750> frame<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.459> can<00:04:14.670> apply

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
adjustments to a frame so you can apply

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.420 
adjustments to a frame so you can apply
the<00:04:15.030> kit
