them<00:03:05.600> kappa<00:03:05.959> chance<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:08.180> know<00:03:08.269> these<00:03:08.600> are

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
them kappa chance and I know these are

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.620 
them kappa chance and I know these are
look<00:03:08.900> like<00:03:09.110> really<00:03:09.890> few<00:03:10.220> because<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.300> was<00:03:11.600> my

of<00:06:19.690> my<00:06:20.020> polymer<00:06:20.529> clay<00:06:20.650> stuff<00:06:21.039> and<00:06:21.340> i'll<00:06:22.060> be

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
of my polymer clay stuff and i'll be

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.540 
of my polymer clay stuff and i'll be
making<00:06:22.539> tutorials<00:06:23.320> really<00:06:23.650> soon<00:06:23.889> so<00:06:24.130> i<00:06:24.279> think

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
making tutorials really soon so i think

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.279 
making tutorials really soon so i think
i'll<00:06:24.789> most<00:06:25.029> probably<00:06:25.300> be<00:06:25.510> making<00:06:25.900> them<00:06:26.110> on
