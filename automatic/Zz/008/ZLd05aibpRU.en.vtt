this wonderful little moving peekaboo

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
this wonderful little moving peekaboo
pop-up<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:37.559> gonna<00:00:37.680> love<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
pop-up and I think you're gonna love the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
pop-up and I think you're gonna love the
mechanism<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> how<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> how<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> piece

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
mechanism and how the how the piece

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
mechanism and how the how the piece
works<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> male<00:00:41.399> piece<00:00:41.670> mailed<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
works so this is a male piece mailed in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.840 
works so this is a male piece mailed in
a<00:00:42.480> clear<00:00:42.719> envelope<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.190> eye<00:00:44.250> catching

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a clear envelope you know eye catching

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.020 
a clear envelope you know eye catching
and<00:00:44.969> fun<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> ships<00:00:45.840> flat<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.030> but

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and fun so it ships flat like this but

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
and fun so it ships flat like this but
when<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> opens<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> opens<00:00:53.100> like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
when it opens so much this so opens like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.740 
when it opens so much this so opens like
this<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.910> slides<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.480> fun<00:00:54.719> little

this and out slides this fun little

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
this and out slides this fun little
peekaboo<00:00:55.230> pop-up<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:55.829> by<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> way<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
peekaboo pop-up which by the way has a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
peekaboo pop-up which by the way has a
QR<00:00:56.670> code<00:00:56.840> reminds<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> town<00:00:58.469> for

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
QR code reminds them about the town for

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010 
QR code reminds them about the town for
the<00:00:58.680> section<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.100> save<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> date<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.840> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the section is save the date so I'm just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080 
the section is save the date so I'm just
got<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.440> fun<00:01:01.770> mechanism<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
got a really fun mechanism and when you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.320 
got a really fun mechanism and when you
look<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> side<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:03.989> watch<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.400> pops<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
look at the side here watch it pops up

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
look at the side here watch it pops up
you<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.900> how<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> dimension<00:01:07.740> turns<00:01:07.950> into

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you see how it the dimension turns into

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
you see how it the dimension turns into
kind<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> rectangle<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.080> there's<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
kind of a rectangle so this there's a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
kind of a rectangle so this there's a
little<00:01:10.710> tab<00:01:11.010> glued<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.299> glued<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
little tab glued here that's glued to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
little tab glued here that's glued to
the<00:01:13.590> cover<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> open<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.880> cover<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the cover so when you open the cover it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.380 
the cover so when you open the cover it
pulls<00:01:15.780> those<00:01:16.560> scores<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.970> turns<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
pulls those scores and it turns the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
pulls those scores and it turns the
piece<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.869> kind<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.470> dimensional

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
piece into kind of a dimensional

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
piece into kind of a dimensional
rectangle<00:01:20.610> also<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.659> has

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
rectangle also that you know has

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
rectangle also that you know has
dimension<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> stand<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> nice

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
dimension it can stand up which is nice

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580 
dimension it can stand up which is nice
so<00:01:23.850> how<00:01:24.210> does<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> work<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.500> gonna

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so how does it work I think you're gonna

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.910 
so how does it work I think you're gonna
love<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> simplicity<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.770> kind

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
love the simplicity of this so it's kind

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.499 
love the simplicity of this so it's kind
of<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.159> trifold<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.150> flag

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of like a trifold with a little flag

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.490 
of like a trifold with a little flag
attached<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> there's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.900> there's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
attached and so there's a little there's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
attached and so there's a little there's
a<00:01:34.560> tab<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> tab<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.210> glue<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
a tab here this was the tab that glue to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.609 
a tab here this was the tab that glue to
cover<00:01:36.750> score<00:01:37.579> diagonal<00:01:38.579> score<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.619> two

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
cover score diagonal score here two

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.780 
cover score diagonal score here two
scores<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.909> off<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.500> interior<00:01:44.220> panel<00:01:44.700> on

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
scores here off the interior panel on

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
scores here off the interior panel on
the<00:01:44.880> back<00:01:45.030> cover<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> single<00:01:46.200> score

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the back cover and then a single score

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.810 
the back cover and then a single score
here<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.880> happens<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.820> second

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
here and so what happens is this second

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.060 
here and so what happens is this second
score<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.840> inner<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> second

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
score not this inner one but the second

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.899 
score not this inner one but the second
one<00:01:53.299> folds<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> tabs<00:01:56.100> flat<00:01:56.490> here

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
one folds in and so the tabs flat here

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.359 
one folds in and so the tabs flat here
and<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> covers<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> cover

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and the covers right here so the cover

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.690 
and the covers right here so the cover
then<00:01:59.689> folds<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.840> glues<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.950> flat<00:02:02.340> tab

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
then folds and glues to that flat tab

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.190 
then folds and glues to that flat tab
and<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.149> what<00:02:03.299> happens<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.719> once<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.079> glued

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and so what happens is once it's glued

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.719 
and so what happens is once it's glued
as<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.189> pull<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.880> open<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.360> piece<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:07.799> that

as you pull to open the piece that that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.650 
as you pull to open the piece that that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
