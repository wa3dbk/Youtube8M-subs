my home page I did actually arranged

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.880 
my home page I did actually arranged
just<00:02:51.060> history<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.870> default<00:02:52.260> layout<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
just history to the default layout I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
just history to the default layout I
know<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.670> kind<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.910> preferred<00:02:54.270> over

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
know I just kind of preferred over

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.540 
know I just kind of preferred over
having<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.200> custom<00:02:55.500> layout<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.950> my<00:02:56.100> opinion<00:02:56.340> it

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
having a custom layout in my opinion it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
having a custom layout in my opinion it
just<00:02:56.820> looks<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.240> bit<00:02:57.690> better<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> as<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.480> can

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
just looks a bit better so as you can

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.270

see<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.290> have<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.830> explain<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.160> because

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
see I don't have to explain it because

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.390 
see I don't have to explain it because
it's<00:03:02.580> just<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.000> stock<00:03:03.900> iOS<00:03:04.350> layout<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.310> my
