activate it now the question is what

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.620 
activate it now the question is what
will<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.369> do<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.290> does<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.820> activates<00:02:10.450> it

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
will it do what it does it activates it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.590 
will it do what it does it activates it
and<00:02:10.810> compresses<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.590> entire<00:02:12.040> room<00:02:12.570> into<00:02:13.570> a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
this is the faith island that we just

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.080 
this is the faith island that we just
compressed<00:02:42.320> using<00:02:42.440> salvation<00:02:43.340> you'll<00:02:43.880> note

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
compressed using salvation you'll note

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.150 
compressed using salvation you'll note
the<00:02:44.240> file<00:02:44.450> name<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.960> direction<00:02:45.530> numerical

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
because the server does not know what it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.630 
because the server does not know what it
is<00:04:02.180> but<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:03.620> faith<00:04:03.830> signature<00:04:04.340> and

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
is but the faith signature and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.520 
is but the faith signature and
everything<00:04:05.180> should<00:04:05.420> still<00:04:05.720> be<00:04:05.870> working<00:04:06.110> as

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
everything should still be working as

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.740 
everything should still be working as
before<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.310> one<00:04:07.790> thing<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.060> note<00:04:08.240> is<00:04:08.270> because

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
bit temperamental still quick thing I

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.510 
bit temperamental still quick thing I
neglected<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.590> mention<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:31.130> what<00:04:31.580> will<00:04:31.730> happen

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
neglected to mention is what will happen

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.900 
neglected to mention is what will happen
there<00:04:32.849> are<00:04:33.090> collisions<00:04:33.780> or<00:04:34.080> if<00:04:34.949> there<00:04:35.370> if

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
there are collisions or if there if

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.249 
there are collisions or if there if
there<00:04:35.970> isn't<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.300> faith<00:04:36.509> that<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.840> signature

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
there isn't a faith that the signature

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
of the ER targeting well I'll move this

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.760 
of the ER targeting well I'll move this
one<00:04:39.539> out<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.780> way<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.110> i'll<00:04:40.440> give<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.710> a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
one out the way and i'll give you a

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.070 
one out the way and i'll give you a
quick<00:04:41.039> demo<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.550> happening<00:04:42.090> pegasus

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
quick demo of that happening pegasus

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.379 
quick demo of that happening pegasus
girls<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.979> we've<00:04:44.099> got<00:04:44.250> some<00:04:44.460> space<00:04:44.759> now

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
girls so we've got some space now

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.080 
girls so we've got some space now
whenever<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.990> faith<00:04:46.770> island<00:04:47.129> is<00:04:47.280> successfully

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
whenever a faith island is successfully

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.960 
whenever a faith island is successfully
imported<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:49.440> file<00:04:49.710> name<00:04:49.949> is<00:04:50.129> changed<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:50.819> it

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
imported the file name is changed so it

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.119 
imported the file name is changed so it
instead<00:04:51.449> of<00:04:51.599> being<00:04:51.780> docked<00:04:52.080> faith<00:04:52.319> it<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.650> dot

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
instead of being docked faith it is dot

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.119 
instead of being docked faith it is dot
faith<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.729> death<00:04:53.879> past<00:04:54.300> tense<00:04:54.509> and<00:04:55.039> there<00:04:56.039> is

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
faith to death past tense and there is

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.550 
faith to death past tense and there is
no<00:04:56.280> faith<00:04:56.550> here<00:04:56.729> time<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.270> signature<00:04:57.629> so<00:04:58.259> the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
no faith here time of a signature so the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.529 
no faith here time of a signature so the
reason<00:04:58.770> for<00:04:59.099> that<00:04:59.129> is<00:04:59.400> it<00:04:59.550> prevents<00:05:00.300> people

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
reason for that is it prevents people

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.210 
reason for that is it prevents people
from<00:05:00.750> duplicating<00:05:01.530> faith<00:05:01.770> spheres

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
from duplicating faith spheres

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.279 
from duplicating faith spheres
infinitely<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.479> also<00:05:03.599> allows<00:05:03.990> server

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
infinitely and it also allows server

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.070 
infinitely and it also allows server
admins<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:04.949> retain<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.580> backup<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.300> island

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
admins to retain a backup of the island

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.850 
admins to retain a backup of the island
