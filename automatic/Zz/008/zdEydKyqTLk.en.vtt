00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.710
 then this little rhyme popular 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.420
 very simple although two agreements from where 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.040
 he then goes out for the cold back 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.080
 normally the cold ground below 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.110
 or above, at the risk of hindering the hand 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.960
 right so we apply the god principle 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.419
 if there is a risk of confused bar ap 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.919
 we get rid of this difficulty for 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.059
 we're not at 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:33.000
 to handle both hands at the same time if 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:36.690
 they are in the same place so I play 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.579
 with the metronome and there are not ten 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.890
 subsidiaries and laundered to a round in 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.870
 middle of the piece 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 our customer four times there is no 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 particular difficulties in this 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.839
 piece the right hand does not move in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 any piece it is not necessary finally it is necessary 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.760
 do it with the metronome for not getting 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.769
 to deceive in the times precisely there are 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.699
 that two agreements so that's really the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.980
 moment to enjoy it for you 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 ensure that you have understood what 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.170
 it's the times so I'll get you from 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.300
 to play 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:17.540
 so 1 2 3 4 1 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.540
 2 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
 1 2 did not notice it's not that I 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.070
 mean is when I press on the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070
 note 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 1 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.570
 2 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.890
 or 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.850
 Oh 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.850
 2 3 4 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 or 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.340
 or 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.500
 1 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.500
 2 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.520
 2 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.550
 or 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.550
 2 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.090
 no 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:22.200
 3 4 so when you take it especially do not 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.780
 do not both hands at the same time 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.719
 right now the place since hand 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.500
 left for the left hand 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:33.470
 do it by counting the times with the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.340
 metronome 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.830
 2 3 4 1 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.989
 2 etc there are times when it lasts that 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.610
 two-time pay close attention to the 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.010
 second line also to the third 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.010
 line so there is a moment waiting 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.390
 2 and after we continue so does well 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.390
 watch out for that
