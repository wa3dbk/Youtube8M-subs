start<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.440> see<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> difference<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> quality

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.560 
start to see the difference in quality
as<00:01:54.510> in<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.530> opinion<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.580> set<00:01:56.880> lacks<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> wood

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
as in my opinion this set lacks the wood

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
as in my opinion this set lacks the wood
workmanship<00:01:58.260> as<00:01:58.620> those<00:01:59.040> sets<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.670> far<00:02:00.180> more

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
workmanship as those sets are far more

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.200 
workmanship as those sets are far more
superior<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.190> feel<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.460> there<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
superior I just don't feel like there is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.660 
superior I just don't feel like there is
enough<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.780> though<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:04.890> make<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.370> for<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
enough here though to make up for the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.469 
enough here though to make up for the
$80<00:02:06.390> price<00:02:06.810> tag<00:02:07.310> obviously<00:02:08.310> reg<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> big
