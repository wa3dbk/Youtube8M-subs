00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.530

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.610
 hello how about my name is that of berto 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.950

 I am a coach and consultant in image and today you 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.990
 I come to speak in an elegant way of 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.210
 how to use a silk scarf 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.260
 but before we start we have to see 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 the difference between an eye scarf and 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.640
 a garnett the scarf is the piece that 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.919
 everyone we know is an art is a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.660
 piece of elongated fabric that can be 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.540
 silk or can be the knitting 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 while a scarf is a scarf one 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.769
 maxi handkerchief a big mask that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.199
 we can fold like scarf 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.440
 there are many ways to use them many 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.239
 italian english knots however not 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.670
 there will be no talk about that too what 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.229
 we can use it as a ghazni but 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.180
 what I have here in the neck is not 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.640
 a gas or a gas is not a piece 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.129
 different from which we will talk about in another 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.619
 capsule but I'm going to teach them is a 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.559
 piece that has two ends in the manner of 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:07.250
 tie and a narrow part in the part 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.890
 good central I told them I'm going to 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.330
 submit three dress codes on 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.820
 casual like the one I bring right now 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.479
 then a casual business and finally 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.450
 a formal outfit let's start with a 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.490
 way to wear the silk scarf 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.890
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.890
 remove our neck can see 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 a very elegant way to use them 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.370
 It is simply 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.370
 letting it fall 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 on our chest 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.700
 and we close it if they fix it I take it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.890
 parallel to the flaps and this gives you 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.850
 a very elegant effect to the dress 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.100
 You can use this look so 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.340
 casual with dress pants or even 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.140
 with jeans you like, let's go to the next one 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.750
 example 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.510
 now we will see a second option that is 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.690
 a casual business dress code 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.970
 that is a little more formal and we will see 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.460
 how can we enhance this look 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.890
 if you look at me personally I like 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.710
 much play with textures with prints 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.520
 and always give a special touch of 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.520
 individuality 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 and if you do not like to feel uniformed 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.610
 Well, these are excellent options for 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.610
 you 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.040
 what do you think is cool, let's go to the third 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.290
 example 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.870
 and finally we are going to see a third 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.019
 more formal cut option as to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.159
 any workday are fixed follow me 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.430
 liking to me the fact of using 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:13.340
 different textures with the tie and with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.709
 the silk scarf and now 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.160
 we will put the blazer but now with a 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.160
 white handkerchief 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.550
 what do you think? 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.980
 as you will see friends the silk scarf will 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.870
 returns in an essential accessory 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.569
 for this season when they start to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.970
 lower temperatures is not only 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.370
 a decorative element that brings us 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.110
 distinction but it also protects us 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 of the cold 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.640
