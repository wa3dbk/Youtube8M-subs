00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
and shakes them hard and she's all the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.650 
and shakes them hard and she's all the
time<00:04:00.769> trying<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> climb<00:04:01.459> through<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:02.299> nobody

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
time trying to climb through but nobody

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.750 
time trying to climb through but nobody
could<00:04:02.750> hide<00:04:02.930> through<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.290> path

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
could hide through that path

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.970 
could hide through that path
it<00:04:03.849> strangles<00:04:04.120> say<00:04:04.569> I<00:04:04.870> think<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.709> why<00:04:05.920> it

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
it strangles say I think that is why it

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.220 
it strangles say I think that is why it
has<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.310> many<00:04:06.459> heads<00:04:06.700> they<00:04:07.450> get<00:04:07.599> free<00:04:07.840> then<00:04:08.170> the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
has so many heads they get free then the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.930 
has so many heads they get free then the
pattern<00:04:08.440> strangles<00:04:09.010> them<00:04:09.099> off<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.700> turns

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
pattern strangles them off and turns

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.070 
pattern strangles them off and turns
them<00:04:10.060> upside<00:04:10.150> down<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.750> makes<00:04:10.900> her<00:04:11.019> eyes

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
them upside down and makes her eyes

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.199 
them upside down and makes her eyes
won't<00:04:11.530> if<00:04:12.220> those<00:04:12.430> heads<00:04:12.640> were<00:04:12.790> covered<00:04:13.060> or

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
won't if those heads were covered or

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.120 
won't if those heads were covered or
taken<00:04:13.510> off<00:04:13.629> it<00:04:13.810> would<00:04:13.930> not<00:04:14.019> be<00:04:14.080> half<00:04:14.319> said<00:04:14.590> bad

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
the tension of the novel the tautness

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.909 
the tension of the novel the tautness
because<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.810> media<00:04:56.139> and<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.470> fear<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:56.889> a

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
because it's a media and the fear is a

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.210 
because it's a media and the fear is a
media<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.370> you're<00:04:57.610> just<00:04:58.449> gonna<00:04:58.539> do<00:04:59.070> and<00:05:00.070> I

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
media and you're just gonna do and I

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.409 
media and you're just gonna do and I
think<00:05:00.400> if<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.520> was<00:05:00.639> written<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:00.970> past<00:05:01.150> tense

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
think if this was written the past tense

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.430 
think if this was written the past tense
you<00:05:01.539> wouldn't<00:05:01.990> be<00:05:02.620> quite<00:05:02.949> so<00:05:05.789> like<00:05:07.229> tied<00:05:08.229> up

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
you wouldn't be quite so like tied up

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.129 
you wouldn't be quite so like tied up
into<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.770> story<00:05:09.039> you<00:05:09.400> feel<00:05:09.639> like<00:05:09.880> you're<00:05:10.150> so<00:05:10.780> I

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
into the story you feel like you're so I

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.050 
into the story you feel like you're so I
felt<00:05:11.410> anyway<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.889> was<00:05:12.039> so<00:05:12.190> wrapped<00:05:12.520> up<00:05:12.729> in<00:05:12.910> it

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060
