00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.380 
how's Josh library I've been on YouTube
couple<00:00:03.659> times<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.910> looking<00:00:05.910> around<00:00:06.000> there

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
couple times and looking around there

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.549 
couple times and looking around there
and<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.629> saw<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.519> guy<00:00:08.519> had<00:00:09.440> let<00:00:10.440> his

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
and I saw that a guy had let his

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.140 
and I saw that a guy had let his
lawnmower<00:00:10.769> run<00:00:11.190> for<00:00:11.370> seven<00:00:11.580> days<00:00:11.790> straight

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
lawnmower run for seven days straight

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.759 
lawnmower run for seven days straight
five<00:00:12.570> or<00:00:12.750> seven<00:00:13.019> days<00:00:13.170> straight<00:00:13.440> or<00:00:13.530> something

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
five or seven days straight or something

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.709 
five or seven days straight or something
like<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> lawn<00:00:14.940> mower<00:00:15.150> tank<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.540> gas

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
like that on a lawn mower tank of gas

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.890 
like that on a lawn mower tank of gas
because<00:00:16.590> he<00:00:16.710> vaporized<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.340> gas<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.690> kept

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
because he vaporized the gas so I kept

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.750 
because he vaporized the gas so I kept
looking<00:00:19.080> around<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.619> saw<00:00:19.830> guys<00:00:20.070> were<00:00:20.279> using<00:00:20.609> on

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
looking around I saw guys were using on

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.650 
looking around I saw guys were using on
their<00:00:20.910> vehicles<00:00:21.300> too<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.590> decided<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.660> make

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
their vehicles too so I decided to make

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.450 
their vehicles too so I decided to make
a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:24.990> experiment<00:00:25.590> myself<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.189> kind<00:00:26.340> of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
a little experiment myself it's kind of

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
a little experiment myself it's kind of
hillbilly<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.150> cheap<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.869> did<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
hillbilly and cheap but I did make it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.050 
hillbilly and cheap but I did make it
work<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> want<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> show<00:00:30.000> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
oh it's a two gallon gas can I just move

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.799 
oh it's a two gallon gas can I just move
some<00:00:41.520> stuff<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> way<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.780> it's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
some stuff out of the way and now it's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.130 
some stuff out of the way and now it's
just<00:00:43.020> sitting<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:44.420> how<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.600> works<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
just sitting there how this works is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.970 
just sitting there how this works is
these<00:00:47.039> hoses<00:00:47.340> I've<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.879> three<00:00:48.120> hoses<00:00:48.510> here

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
these hoses I've got three hoses here

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.619 
these hoses I've got three hoses here
that<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.129> down<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> bottom<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> tank

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
that go down to the bottom of the tank

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.670 
that go down to the bottom of the tank
these<00:00:54.629> hoses<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.800> our<00:00:56.760> air<00:00:57.480> hoses<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.500> go

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
these hoses here our air hoses that go

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.760 
these hoses here our air hoses that go
into<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.219> air<00:00:59.760> cleaner<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:01.530> motor

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
into the air cleaner there the motor

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.060 
into the air cleaner there the motor
sucks<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.340> air<00:01:02.550> through<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.059> hoses<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
sucks in air through these hoses and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
sucks in air through these hoses and
pulls<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> vapor<00:01:05.640> from<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> gas<00:01:06.780> can

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
pulls out the vapor from the gas can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
pulls out the vapor from the gas can
because<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.159> causes<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.700> these<00:01:09.060> hoses<00:01:09.390> bubble

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
because it causes the these hoses bubble

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.570 
because it causes the these hoses bubble
the<00:01:10.260> gas<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> vapor<00:01:10.920> comes<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.400> right

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the gas and the vapor comes out right

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.249 
the gas and the vapor comes out right
here<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> top<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.080> air<00:01:13.830> cleaner<00:01:14.040> here

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
here into the top of my air cleaner here

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.450 
here into the top of my air cleaner here
let<00:01:16.259> me<00:01:16.320> show<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> inside<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.070> air<00:01:17.159> cleaner

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
let me show you inside the air cleaner

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.700 
let me show you inside the air cleaner
real<00:01:17.700> quick<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.150> made<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> little<00:01:19.049> metal<00:01:19.500> thing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
real quick I made a little metal thing

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.980 
real quick I made a little metal thing
to<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.790> around<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.509> drill<00:01:21.840> some

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to go around here and just drill some

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
to go around here and just drill some
holes<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> hoses<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.369> tape<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> on

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
holes to put the hoses in and tape it on

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.920 
holes to put the hoses in and tape it on
nothing<00:01:24.780> real<00:01:24.900> special<00:01:26.450> I'll<00:01:27.450> show<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
nothing real special I'll show you the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.120 
nothing real special I'll show you the
inside<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> air<00:01:28.560> cleaner<00:01:28.920> here

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.999 

I<00:01:32.570> took<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> air<00:01:33.960> filter<00:01:34.380> louts<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I took the air filter louts because I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
I took the air filter louts because I
didn't<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.580> in<00:01:35.759> case<00:01:35.939> extra<00:01:36.570> gas<00:01:36.750> got

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
didn't want just in case extra gas got

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.740 
didn't want just in case extra gas got
in<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.759> for<00:01:38.759> whatever<00:01:38.909> reason<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
in there for whatever reason and it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.160 
in there for whatever reason and it
could<00:01:39.900> breathe<00:01:40.080> easier<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.570> see<00:01:42.570> those<00:01:42.750> inside

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
could breathe easier to see those inside

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.280 
could breathe easier to see those inside
you<00:01:43.740> could<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> hoses<00:01:45.140> poking<00:01:46.140> through

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you could see the hoses poking through

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.899 
you could see the hoses poking through
there<00:01:46.500> they're<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.860> sitting<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:49.909> put
