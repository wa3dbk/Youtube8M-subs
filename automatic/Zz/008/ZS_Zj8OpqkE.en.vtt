more<00:01:30.220> damage<00:01:30.580> by<00:01:30.730> hacks

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.820 

let's<00:01:35.390> get<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.840> neutral<00:01:36.140> again<00:01:36.530> we<00:01:36.680> get<00:01:36.800> a

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
let's get to the neutral again we get a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.580 
let's get to the neutral again we get a
trade<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.400> acts<00:01:37.700> gets<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.510> right<00:01:38.720> angle<00:01:39.290> and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
trade and acts gets the right angle and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.940 
trade and acts gets the right angle and
it<00:01:39.950> also<00:01:40.070> avoids<00:01:40.430> that<00:01:40.610> laser<00:01:41.410> just<00:01:42.410> one<00:01:42.860> of

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
it also avoids that laser just one of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.180 
it also avoids that laser just one of
those<00:01:43.040> two<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:44.630> get<00:01:44.840> thunders<00:01:45.170> others<00:01:45.470> oh<00:01:45.710> but

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
those two we get thunders others oh but

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.610 
those two we get thunders others oh but
