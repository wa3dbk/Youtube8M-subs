00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.609 

but<00:01:30.409> I'm<00:01:30.560> going<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.770> start<00:01:31.159> with<00:01:31.750> volcanoes

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
but I'm going to start with volcanoes

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.990 
but I'm going to start with volcanoes
they're<00:01:35.189> terrifyingly<00:01:36.119> destructive<00:01:38.000> but

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
they're terrifyingly destructive but

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
they're terrifyingly destructive but
they're<00:01:39.149> also<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.810> most<00:01:39.990> fundamental<00:01:40.859> force

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
they're also the most fundamental force

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.219 
they're also the most fundamental force
on<00:01:41.429> the<00:01:41.549> planet

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.139 

volcanoes<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.259> part<00:01:46.859> of<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> global<00:01:47.759> system

volcanoes are part of a global system

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.550 
volcanoes are part of a global system
that<00:01:48.420> continually<00:01:49.350> reshapes<00:01:50.189> our<00:01:50.490> wounded

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that continually reshapes our wounded

they<00:01:53.070> hold<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> key<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.390> origins<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> life

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they hold the key to the origins of life

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.999 
they hold the key to the origins of life
on<00:01:55.560> earth<00:01:56.720> they<00:01:57.720> saved<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> planet<00:01:58.530> from<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
on earth they saved the planet from the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.840 
on earth they saved the planet from the
biggest<00:01:59.490> crisis<00:02:00.060> its<00:02:00.329> ever<00:02:00.899> faced

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.460 

and<00:02:05.090> they've<00:02:05.300> even<00:02:05.450> formed<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.050> partnership

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
and they've even formed a partnership

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.100 
and they've even formed a partnership
with<00:02:06.800> life<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.880> keeps<00:02:08.210> our<00:02:08.479> planet

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
with life that keeps our planet
