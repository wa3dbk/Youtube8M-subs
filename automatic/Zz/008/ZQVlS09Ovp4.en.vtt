00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
problems so there's a lot of things we
got<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> consider<00:01:33.600> maybe<00:01:33.869> they'll<00:01:34.229> reduce

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
got to consider maybe they'll reduce

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.890 
got to consider maybe they'll reduce
that<00:01:34.920> probably<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.270> rate<00:01:36.570> but

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that probably know I have this rate but

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.520 
that probably know I have this rate but
hopefully<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.009> will<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.400> soon

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
hopefully they will pretty soon

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.680 
hopefully they will pretty soon
and<00:01:39.680> also<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:41.420> looks<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:43.030> 8970<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.150> 89

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
and also it looks like the 8970 and 89

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.370 
and also it looks like the 8970 and 89

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
they don't mean it literally the next

they don't mean it literally the next
halo<00:02:16.220> they<00:02:16.850> mean<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.300> game<00:02:17.690> as<00:02:17.900> big<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.500> halo

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
halo they mean a game as big as halo

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.130

especially<00:02:19.489> when<00:02:19.970> he<00:02:20.090> first<00:02:20.570> came<00:02:20.840> out<00:02:20.989> you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
especially when he first came out you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.479 
especially when he first came out you
know<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.500> biggest<00:02:22.010> thing<00:02:22.250> out

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
know it's just the biggest thing out

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.910 
know it's just the biggest thing out
there<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.870> don't<00:02:24.290> know<00:02:24.440> about<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.769> is

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
there so I don't know about this is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.080 
there so I don't know about this is
seems<00:02:25.069> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> skipped<00:02:25.550> school<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.760> kind<00:02:26.000> of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
seems kind of skipped school and kind of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.699 
seems kind of skipped school and kind of
iffy<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.870> they're<00:02:26.989> just<00:02:27.019> thrown<00:02:27.560> out

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
iffy I think they're just thrown out

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.699 
iffy I think they're just thrown out
words<00:02:27.980> because<00:02:28.550> if<00:02:28.760> they<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.569> then<00:02:30.230> well

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
words because if they do that then well

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.740 
words because if they do that then well
since<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:31.430> microsoft<00:02:31.940> studios<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.630> have

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
since it's microsoft studios that have

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.630 
since it's microsoft studios that have
owned<00:02:32.870> by<00:02:32.989> microsoft<00:02:33.170> why<00:02:34.160> would<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:34.459> keep

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
owned by microsoft why would they keep

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.400 
owned by microsoft why would they keep
two<00:02:34.910> companies<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:36.019> are<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.319> be

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
two companies that are going to be

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.720 
two companies that are going to be
competing<00:02:36.769> against<00:02:37.250> each<00:02:37.310> other<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.700> know

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
competing against each other you know

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.040 
competing against each other you know
they're<00:02:37.940> just<00:02:37.970> going<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.360> choose<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.780> winner

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
they're just going to choose the winner

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.070 
they're just going to choose the winner
so<00:02:39.650> maybe<00:02:39.860> um<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.640> coming<00:02:41.090> there's<00:02:41.810> gonna<00:02:41.959> be

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
so maybe um of coming there's gonna be

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.930 
so maybe um of coming there's gonna be
like<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.230> sort<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:42.800> test<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.340> know<00:02:43.459> comparing

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
like a sort of test you know comparing

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.270 
like a sort of test you know comparing
halo<00:02:44.299> 4<00:02:44.600> or<00:02:44.959> halo<00:02:45.170> 5<00:02:45.440> if<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.739> comes<00:02:45.920> out<00:02:46.040> next

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
halo 4 or halo 5 if it comes out next

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.240 
halo 4 or halo 5 if it comes out next
year<00:02:46.720> versus<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.019> know<00:02:48.049> this<00:02:48.350> company's<00:02:48.860> game

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
year versus you know this company's game

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.880 
year versus you know this company's game
to<00:02:49.549> see<00:02:49.760> which<00:02:50.090> one<00:02:50.510> can<00:02:50.840> really<00:02:51.410> make<00:02:51.590> better

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
to see which one can really make better

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.069 
to see which one can really make better
games<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.489> they<00:02:52.610> don't<00:02:52.820> know<00:02:52.940> who<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.690> let<00:02:53.840> go

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
games so they don't know who to let go

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.830 
games so they don't know who to let go
or<00:02:54.350> keep<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.430> i<00:02:55.760> don't<00:02:55.970> know<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.420> i<00:02:56.600> said<00:02:56.810> i

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
or keep so i don't know like i said i

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.210 
or keep so i don't know like i said i
think<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.350> they're<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:57.680> throwing<00:02:57.860> words

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
think that they're just throwing words

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.740 
think that they're just throwing words
around<00:02:58.430> or<00:02:58.910> just<00:02:58.940> trying<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.329> get<00:02:59.450> people's

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
around or just trying to get people's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.509 
around or just trying to get people's
excitements<00:03:00.500> really<00:03:00.829> hyped<00:03:01.040> up<00:03:01.280> and

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
excitements really hyped up and

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.180 
excitements really hyped up and
everything<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.769> me

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
everything so that's just me

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.580 
everything so that's just me
now<00:03:06.090> Far<00:03:06.300> Cry<00:03:06.450> 3<00:03:06.540> has<00:03:06.840> been<00:03:07.050> out<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.380> while

able<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.570> easily<00:04:07.350> do<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.190> wii<00:04:08.400> u

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
able to just easily do it on the wii u

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.150 
able to just easily do it on the wii u
screen<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:09.900> i<00:04:09.930> understand<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.680> would<00:04:10.830> been<00:04:10.980> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
screen so i understand that would been a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.340 
screen so i understand that would been a
lot<00:04:11.430> easier<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.030> think<00:04:12.120> for<00:04:12.330> open<00:04:12.780> world<00:04:12.989> games

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
lot easier I think for open world games

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.530 
lot easier I think for open world games
the<00:04:14.070> wii<00:04:14.220> u's<00:04:14.250> gonna<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.700> especially<00:04:15.150> useful

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
the wii u's gonna be especially useful

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.810 
the wii u's gonna be especially useful
