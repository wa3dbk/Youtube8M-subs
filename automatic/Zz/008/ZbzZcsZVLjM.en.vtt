00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.660
 whether went out to the city hall art about me survives the universe 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.310
 and our world two points of decay and we will make this the date of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.520

 life is short-lived it is livelier it is intelligent filter 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.250
 is an energy field back that holds everything together and here and I are part of it 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.189
 from this field 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.919
 everyone can speak this language 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.639
 and we will learn to ultimately use the language to get to this 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.759
 Field to speak 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.759
