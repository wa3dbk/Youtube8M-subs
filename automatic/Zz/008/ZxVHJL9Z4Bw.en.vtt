and more you know there's a lot of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.150 
and more you know there's a lot of
things<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.750> really<00:01:12.200> love<00:01:12.410> about<00:01:12.440> my<00:01:12.680> pan<00:01:13.009> but

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
let me tell you about the arched

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.180 
let me tell you about the arched
extra-long<00:01:15.170> stainless<00:01:15.680> steel<00:01:15.860> handles

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
extra-long stainless steel handles

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.280 
extra-long stainless steel handles
they're<00:01:16.909> pulled<00:01:17.119> away<00:01:17.240> from<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.690> pan<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.200> it

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
they're pulled away from the pan so it

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.719 
they're pulled away from the pan so it
keeps<00:01:18.440> your<00:01:18.650> hands<00:01:18.799> nice<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.310> cool<00:01:19.490> while

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
keeps your hands nice and cool while

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.490 
keeps your hands nice and cool while
cooking<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.210> also<00:01:20.750> if<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:20.990> think<00:01:21.020> about<00:01:21.350> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
cooking and also if you think about the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.410 
cooking and also if you think about the
v-shape<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.369> material<00:01:22.850> itself<00:01:23.119> because

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
v-shape of the material itself because

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.969 
v-shape of the material itself because
stainless<00:01:23.630> steel<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:24.049> such<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> poor<00:01:24.470> conductor

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
stainless steel is such a poor conductor

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.859 
stainless steel is such a poor conductor
of<00:01:25.010> heat<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:25.880> going<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.090> stop<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.720> heat

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
of heat it's going to stop the heat

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.810 
of heat it's going to stop the heat
transfer<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.159> when<00:01:28.250> you're<00:01:28.340> sauteing

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
transfer right so when you're sauteing

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.490 
transfer right so when you're sauteing
something<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.540> hands<00:01:29.840> stay<00:01:29.990> nice<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.200> cool

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
something your hands stay nice and cool

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.219 
something your hands stay nice and cool
and<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.070> heat<00:01:31.250> stays<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.790> pan<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:33.110> there's

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
and the heat stays in the pan so there's

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.780 
and the heat stays in the pan so there's
so<00:01:33.320> many<00:01:33.409> amazing<00:01:33.710> functions<00:01:34.430> about<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
so many amazing functions about the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.700 
so many amazing functions about the
saute<00:01:35.150> pans<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.810> one<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.320> reasons<00:01:36.590> we've

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
saute pans and one of the reasons we've

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.260 
saute pans and one of the reasons we've
taken<00:01:36.950> 3<00:01:37.220> years<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.549> design<00:01:37.670> them<00:01:38.030> because<00:01:38.180> I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
taken 3 years to design them because I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.289 
taken 3 years to design them because I
really<00:01:38.450> want<00:01:38.659> them<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.990> perfect<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:39.830> each

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
really want them to be perfect so each

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.080 
really want them to be perfect so each
saute<00:01:41.299> pan<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:42.470> sauce<00:01:42.920> pot<00:01:43.189> come<00:01:43.909> with<00:01:44.030> a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
saute pan and a sauce pot come with a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.429 
saute pan and a sauce pot come with a
tapered<00:01:44.360> lip<00:01:44.780> what<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.049> think<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.290> really

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
tapered lip what you think is really

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.320 
tapered lip what you think is really
important<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.100> get<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.220> nice<00:01:46.400> even<00:01:46.700> stream

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
important so you get a nice even stream
