00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.780
 I enter this base, as nobody else does, Voice that satisfies, there is nobody to replace me 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.620
 Nobody who threatens me, I do what I like, I do not lack anything if I have the double H 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.320
 My flow as the sun with a finger does not get covered Putting my city Kanapaz back on the map 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.880
 And the Charko, my lyric as a network catches you I eliminate them, murderer, nobody escapes me 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.580
 Ready pal attack, there is no one to overshadow us Third Poet and Zk put you in Jaque ... 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.160
 Mate, taking another hit from the bat Your talent? Amm ... mine exceeds carat 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.860
 There's nothing that compares me, nothing that equals me. No one stops me, I'm speeding like a bullet 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.480
 Nothing and nobody will be able to stop me, nor the karma. I am a serial killer where MIC is my weapon. 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.060
 Nobody has what I have, nobody writes what I write Nobody knows where I come from, nobody lives what I live 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.680
 Nobody can stop me, nobody, nobody is capable No one, nobody is the same, nobody is me, there is no one else 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 Nobody has what I have, nobody writes what I write Nobody knows where I come from, nobody lives what I live 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.940
 Nobody can stop me, nobody, nobody is capable No one, nobody is the same, nobody is me, there is no one else 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.700
 Nobody has what I write, nobody does it like me No one compares my style, my voice and also my flow 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.280
 In the stage good show, Cananea and Agua Prieta Killers of Mike, Sheqo and Third Poet 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.880
 ZK is the clica, DM clan my result Nobody can stop us the terrain is controlled 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.360
 Everyone wants to confront each other, but nobody has succeeded The attempt remains in that, in attempt it has remained 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 I leave them destroyed with ease and skill And cruelly kill them ... in two stages 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.940
 Catch the punch line and see what we do I'm the rain on your sunny day and the end of your game 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.579
 Here there are no relays if the ego was sunk in. I am death with a mike in my hand instead of OZ 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.480
 Oh shit, my songs speak for me From the city of Zaino, a killer on a beat 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.780
 Nobody has what I have, nobody writes what I write Nobody knows where I come from, nobody lives what I live 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.520
 Nobody can stop me, nobody, nobody is capable No one, nobody is the same, nobody is me, there is no one else 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.100
 Nobody has what I have, nobody writes what I write Nobody knows where I come from, nobody lives what I live 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.780
 Nobody can stop me, nobody, nobody is capable No one, nobody is the same, nobody is me, there is no one else 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.600

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.980
 Nobody has what I have, nobody writes what I write Nobody knows where I come from, nobody lives what I live 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.540
 Nobody can stop me, nobody, nobody is capable No one, nobody is the same, nobody is me, there is no one else 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.380
 Nobody has what I have, nobody writes what I write Nobody knows where I come from, nobody lives what I live 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.960
 Nobody can stop me, nobody, nobody is capable No one, nobody is the same, nobody is me, there is no one else
