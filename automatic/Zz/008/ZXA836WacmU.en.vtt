using<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.600> fire<00:00:30.869> line<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.740> using

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
using a fire line I'm going to be using

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
using a fire line I'm going to be using
crystal<00:00:32.369> because<00:00:32.519> of<00:00:32.760> the<00:00:32.820> color<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.239> seed

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
crystal because of the color of my seed

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
crystal because of the color of my seed
beads<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.110> you'll<00:00:34.290> need<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.500> needle<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:35.070> you

nipper tool okay the first thing we're
going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.800> thread<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.280> our<00:00:41.309> stop<00:00:41.790> bead

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
going to do is thread on our stop bead

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020 
going to do is thread on our stop bead
and<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:43.260> threaded<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.339> over<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.610> yard

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and I have threaded a little over a yard

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.469 
and I have threaded a little over a yard
of<00:00:45.210> crystal<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.690> onto<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.650> needle<00:00:47.549> and<00:00:47.879> I'm

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
of crystal on onto my needle and I'm

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.270 
of crystal on onto my needle and I'm
going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.780> use<00:00:48.900> a<00:00:48.930> contrast<00:00:49.589> color<00:00:49.769> or

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
going to use a contrast color or

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.420 
going to use a contrast color or
different<00:00:50.760> seed<00:00:50.940> bead<00:00:51.650> for<00:00:52.650> my<00:00:52.799> stop<00:00:53.070> bead<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
different seed bead for my stop bead so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.009 
different seed bead for my stop bead so
don't<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.760> confused<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.809> beadwork

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
don't get confused with in my beadwork

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.130 
don't get confused with in my beadwork
so<00:00:55.799> I'm<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> string<00:00:56.369> it<00:00:56.400> onto<00:00:56.760> my<00:00:56.909> thread

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
so I'm going to string it onto my thread

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.450 
so I'm going to string it onto my thread
I'm<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> leave<00:00:58.500> myself<00:00:58.680> six<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.309> eight

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I'm going to leave myself six to eight

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.689 
I'm going to leave myself six to eight
inch<00:00:59.790> tail<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:01.470> I'm<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> run<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
inch tail and then I'm going to run the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.680 
inch tail and then I'm going to run the
needle<00:01:02.940> back<00:01:03.479> through<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:03.930> opposite<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:05.690> and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
needle back through the opposite way and

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.260 
needle back through the opposite way and
this<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.320> lock<00:01:08.159> our<00:01:08.340> bead<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.700> place<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this will lock our bead in place and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
this will lock our bead in place and
this<00:01:09.750> keeps<00:01:09.960> our<00:01:10.140> beadwork<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.770> sliding<00:01:11.070> off

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
this keeps our beadwork from sliding off

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
this keeps our beadwork from sliding off
the<00:01:11.369> end<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:11.760> thread<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> next

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the end of our thread and then the next

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.570 
the end of our thread and then the next
thing<00:01:13.530> I've<00:01:13.710> done<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.070> I've<00:01:14.220> laid<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
thing I've done is I've laid out the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.870 
thing I've done is I've laid out the
color<00:01:14.970> pattern<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> bracelet<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.880> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
color pattern for the bracelet and this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140 
color pattern for the bracelet and this
will<00:01:18.270> help<00:01:18.590> if<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.800> by<00:01:19.980> doing<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.760> before

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
will help if I by doing this one before

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.120 
will help if I by doing this one before
I<00:01:21.180> start<00:01:21.390> stringing<00:01:21.660> will<00:01:21.870> help<00:01:22.020> create<00:01:22.800> my

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I start stringing will help create my

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.940 
I start stringing will help create my
pattern<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.930> odd<00:01:25.110> count<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.830> I've

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
pattern and so this is odd count so I've

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
pattern and so this is odd count so I've
got<00:01:26.130> nine<00:01:26.460> beads<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
got nine beads here so I'm just going to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.750 
got nine beads here so I'm just going to
thread<00:01:28.050> all<00:01:28.320> nine<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> these<00:01:28.980> beads<00:01:29.250> onto<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
thread all nine of these beads onto the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.400 
thread all nine of these beads onto the
thread<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.050> let<00:01:37.230> them

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
thread and then I'm going to let them

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.430 
thread and then I'm going to let them
drop<00:01:37.620> down<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.490> stop<00:01:38.700> bead<00:01:38.910> this<00:01:39.870> starts

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
drop down to the stop bead this starts

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.060 
drop down to the stop bead this starts
out<00:01:40.620> just<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.730> even<00:01:42.270> count<00:01:42.510> peyote<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
out just like even count peyote so the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.410 
out just like even count peyote so the
first<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:44.730> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.150> is

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
first thing that we're going to do is

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.290 
first thing that we're going to do is
we're<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.020> pick<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:47.670> color<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
we're going to pick up this color and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.240

all the others so now what I'm going to
do<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:25.070> I'm<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.610> bring<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.030> down<00:03:26.299> in

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
do is that I'm going to bring it down in

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.479 
do is that I'm going to bring it down in
this<00:03:27.620> bead<00:03:30.340> bring<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.430> up<00:03:31.700> through<00:03:31.970> there<00:03:33.489> and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
this bead bring it up through there and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.650 
this bead bring it up through there and
what<00:03:34.640> we're<00:03:34.760> doing<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:35.000> we're<00:03:35.090> making<00:03:35.120> kind<00:03:35.540> of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
what we're doing is we're making kind of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.710 
what we're doing is we're making kind of
a<00:03:35.780> little<00:03:36.049> loop<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:37.000> lock<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.269> bead<00:03:38.510> in<00:03:38.690> place

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
a little loop to lock that bead in place

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.509 
a little loop to lock that bead in place
so<00:03:39.440> then<00:03:39.590> I'm<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:39.830> come<00:03:40.070> back<00:03:40.280> through

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
so then I'm going to come back through

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.060 
so then I'm going to come back through
this<00:03:40.640> top<00:03:40.880> bead<00:03:41.320> and<00:03:42.320> then<00:03:42.440> go<00:03:42.590> back<00:03:42.799> down

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
this top bead and then go back down

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.550 
this top bead and then go back down
through<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.549> one<00:03:47.080> back<00:03:48.080> through<00:03:48.410> this

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
through that one back through this

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.509 
through that one back through this
bottom<00:03:49.070> one<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:53.560> now<00:03:54.560> I'll<00:03:54.830> be<00:03:54.860> ready<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.250> come

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
bottom one and now I'll be ready to come

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.460 
bottom one and now I'll be ready to come
back<00:03:55.700> out<00:03:55.880> through<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.360> bead<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:57.320> can

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
back out through this bead and we can

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.430 
back out through this bead and we can
start<00:03:57.739> our<00:03:57.860> new<00:03:58.040> row<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:59.690> don't<00:03:59.870> have<00:04:00.110> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
start our new row and you don't have to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.710 
start our new row and you don't have to
but<00:04:00.830> I<00:04:00.950> like<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.489> flip<00:04:01.790> my<00:04:01.910> work<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.360> now<00:04:02.540> I'm

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
but I like to flip my work so now I'm

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720 
but I like to flip my work so now I'm
back<00:04:02.930> at<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.260> starting<00:04:03.620> point<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.130> I'm<00:04:04.519> just

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
back at a starting point so I'm just

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.180 
back at a starting point so I'm just
going<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:04.970> flip<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.360> over<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.959> start<00:04:06.950> picking

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
going to flip it over and start picking

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.699 
going to flip it over and start picking
up<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.989> next<00:04:08.989> row<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.260> beads<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:11.590> complete<00:04:12.590> the

this<00:07:00.270> is<00:07:00.449> to<00:07:00.629> tie<00:07:00.840> the<00:07:00.900> thread<00:07:01.379> off<00:07:01.680> and<00:07:02.099> then

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
this is to tie the thread off and then

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.429 
this is to tie the thread off and then
we<00:07:02.580> basically<00:07:03.000> do<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.389> same<00:07:03.719> thing<00:07:04.050> to<00:07:04.229> tie<00:07:04.409> a

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
we basically do the same thing to tie a

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:08.300 
we basically do the same thing to tie a
new<00:07:04.800> thread<00:07:05.129> on<00:07:05.310> it<00:07:06.469> just<00:07:07.469> happens<00:07:07.860> to<00:07:07.979> be<00:07:08.069> my

least favorite part of weaving adding
and<00:07:13.099> threads<00:07:14.099> just<00:07:15.110> do<00:07:16.110> that<00:07:16.289> and<00:07:16.500> I'd<00:07:16.590> like<00:07:16.830> to

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:17.069 
and threads just do that and I'd like to

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:25.969 
and threads just do that and I'd like to
kind<00:07:17.250> of<00:07:17.870> exit<00:07:19.759> now<00:07:20.759> here<00:07:23.750> and<00:07:24.750> then<00:07:25.050> I'll<00:07:25.860> be

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 
kind of exit now here and then I'll be

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.080 
kind of exit now here and then I'll be
going<00:07:26.129> to<00:07:26.189> do<00:07:26.250> is<00:07:26.310> take<00:07:26.460> our<00:07:26.610> needle<00:07:26.759> off<00:07:26.939> the

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
going to do is take our needle off the

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.959 
going to do is take our needle off the
thread<00:07:27.419> and<00:07:27.949> trim<00:07:28.949> this<00:07:29.219> with<00:07:29.639> the<00:07:29.789> nipper

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:29.969 
thread and trim this with the nipper

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:31.640 
thread and trim this with the nipper
tool<00:07:30.210> is<00:07:30.389> closest<00:07:30.840> to<00:07:30.870> the<00:07:31.020> beadwork<00:07:31.289> as

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650 
tool is closest to the beadwork as

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.719 
tool is closest to the beadwork as
possible<00:07:32.360> and<00:07:33.919> then<00:07:34.919> we'll<00:07:35.069> tie<00:07:35.250> a<00:07:35.279> new<00:07:35.490> thread

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:35.729 
possible and then we'll tie a new thread

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.879 
possible and then we'll tie a new thread
on
