we<00:00:42.070> did<00:00:42.280> sort<00:00:42.490> of<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.670> what<00:00:42.820> I<00:00:42.850> call<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.120> tabletop

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
we did sort of it what I call a tabletop

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.010 
we did sort of it what I call a tabletop
clamshell<00:00:44.980> lighting<00:00:45.340> setup<00:00:45.700> you'll<00:00:46.630> notice

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
clamshell lighting setup you'll notice

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.450 
clamshell lighting setup you'll notice
in<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.230> image<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.740> the<00:00:47.920> light<00:00:48.130> is<00:00:48.310> not

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
in the image that the light is not

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.060 
in the image that the light is not
actually<00:00:48.970> even<00:00:49.090> pointing<00:00:49.870> at<00:00:50.110> Ellie<00:00:50.740> it's

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
actually even pointing at Ellie it's

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.040 
actually even pointing at Ellie it's
feathered<00:00:51.580> off<00:00:51.790> vertically<00:00:52.450> so<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.720> have<00:00:52.960> it

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
feathered off vertically so I have it

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.750 
feathered off vertically so I have it
almost<00:00:53.260> like<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.500> tabletop<00:00:54.100> where<00:00:54.610> it's

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
almost like a tabletop where it's

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.000 
almost like a tabletop where it's
sitting<00:00:55.020> facing<00:00:56.020> almost<00:00:56.170> straight<00:00:56.620> down<00:00:56.650> but

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
sitting facing almost straight down but

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.800 
sitting facing almost straight down but
I<00:00:57.040> move<00:00:57.340> it<00:00:57.520> far<00:00:57.820> enough<00:00:57.940> away<00:00:58.150> from<00:00:58.330> her<00:00:58.630> so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
I move it far enough away from her so

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.660 
I move it far enough away from her so
just<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.140> edge<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.710> that<00:00:59.860> light<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.130> catching

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
just the edge of that light is catching

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.799 
just the edge of that light is catching
her<00:01:00.790> we<00:01:01.210> also<00:01:01.450> put<00:01:01.900> the<00:01:03.089> outer<00:01:04.089> diffusion

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
her we also put the outer diffusion

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.680 
her we also put the outer diffusion
panel<00:01:05.260> on<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.190> Zeppelin<00:01:06.760> because<00:01:07.660> I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
panel on to the Zeppelin because I

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.540 
panel on to the Zeppelin because I
wanted<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.229> light<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:08.530> come<00:01:08.650> out<00:01:08.800> super<00:01:09.130> even

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
wanted that light to come out super even

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.710 
wanted that light to come out super even
and<00:01:09.670> super<00:01:09.940> soft<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.270> didn't<00:01:10.450> want<00:01:10.570> any

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
and super soft I didn't want any

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.240 
and super soft I didn't want any
specular<00:01:11.229> highlights<00:01:11.590> coming<00:01:11.920> out<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.160> the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
specular highlights coming out of the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.460 
specular highlights coming out of the
image<00:01:12.490> at<00:01:12.610> all<00:01:12.759> I<00:01:12.820> wanted<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.360> incredibly<00:01:14.050> soft

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
image at all I wanted it incredibly soft

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.249 
image at all I wanted it incredibly soft
then<00:01:14.830> all<00:01:14.950> we<00:01:15.070> did<00:01:15.220> for<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:16.110> underneath<00:01:17.110> the

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
then all we did for the underneath the

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.719 
then all we did for the underneath the
clamshell<00:01:17.560> part<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.280> reason<00:01:18.550> they<00:01:18.640> call

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
clamshell part and the reason they call

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:19.920 
clamshell part and the reason they call
a<00:01:18.790> clamshell<00:01:19.060> Lending's<00:01:19.509> because<00:01:19.690> it<00:01:19.780> looks

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
a clamshell Lending's because it looks

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.170 
a clamshell Lending's because it looks
like<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.080> clam<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.800> surrounding<00:01:21.790> or<00:01:21.880> eating

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
like a clam is surrounding or eating

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.850 
like a clam is surrounding or eating
your<00:01:22.300> face<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.840> sense<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.350> clamshell

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
your face in a sense and clamshell

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.320 
your face in a sense and clamshell
lighting<00:01:24.070> there<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.310> go<00:01:24.460> we<00:01:24.940> have<00:01:25.060> light<00:01:25.210> from

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
lighting there you go we have light from

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.030 
lighting there you go we have light from
the<00:01:25.450> top<00:01:25.660> light<00:01:26.320> from<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.590> bottom<00:01:26.860> when<00:01:26.950> you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
the top light from the bottom when you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.499 
the top light from the bottom when you
put<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.280> light<00:01:27.430> that<00:01:27.610> aggressive<00:01:28.150> at<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.330> top

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
put the light that aggressive at the top

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.030 
put the light that aggressive at the top
we<00:01:28.660> end<00:01:28.810> up<00:01:28.900> getting<00:01:28.990> those<00:01:29.229> deeper<00:01:29.650> shadows

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
we end up getting those deeper shadows

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.010 
we end up getting those deeper shadows
underneath<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.880> we<00:01:30.970> put<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> simple<00:01:31.690> silver

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
underneath so we put a simple silver

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.450 
underneath so we put a simple silver
reflector<00:01:32.530> underneath<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.979> pop<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> light

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
reflector underneath to pop the light

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.370 
reflector underneath to pop the light
back<00:01:33.610> up<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.880> open<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.210> shadows<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.200> very

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
back up to open the shadows it's a very

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.020 
back up to open the shadows it's a very
glamour<00:01:35.860> II<00:01:36.009> kind<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.369> lighting<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:36.850> want

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
glamour II kind of lighting and I want

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.280 
glamour II kind of lighting and I want
to<00:01:37.090> show<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.300> you<00:01:37.479> could<00:01:37.570> do<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:37.960> kind<00:01:38.229> of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
to show that you could do that kind of

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.810 
to show that you could do that kind of
lighting<00:01:38.530> with<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.710> Zeppelin<00:01:39.100> at<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.610> very

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
lighting with the Zeppelin at the very

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.639 
lighting with the Zeppelin at the very
end<00:01:40.030> we<00:01:40.180> did<00:01:40.390> one<00:01:40.720> more<00:01:40.750> setup<00:01:41.259> where<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:41.380> just

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
end we did one more setup where we just

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.499 
end we did one more setup where we just
pulled<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.979> reflector<00:01:42.460> out<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.119> bottom

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
pulled the reflector out of the bottom

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.420 
pulled the reflector out of the bottom
and<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.170> had<00:01:44.320> her<00:01:44.409> slightly<00:01:44.830> tilt<00:01:45.190> her

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
and I just had her slightly tilt her

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.430 
and I just had her slightly tilt her
chin<00:01:45.729> up<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.510> we<00:01:46.840> would<00:01:46.990> continue<00:01:47.260> to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
chin up so that we would continue to

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.020 
chin up so that we would continue to
catch<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.920> soft<00:01:48.280> light<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.760> was<00:01:48.790> still

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
catch that soft light but it was still

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.790 
catch that soft light but it was still
feathered<00:01:49.420> off<00:01:49.540> really<00:01:49.840> heavily<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.560> she<00:01:50.620> was

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
feathered off really heavily so she was

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.230 
feathered off really heavily so she was
just<00:01:51.010> catching<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.340> edge<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.729> he<00:01:51.790> because<00:01:51.940> as

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
just catching the edge and he because as

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.370 
just catching the edge and he because as
we<00:01:52.420> can<00:01:52.540> see<00:01:52.659> in<00:01:52.750> those<00:01:52.870> shots

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
we can see in those shots

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.649 
we can see in those shots
these<00:01:53.830> barely<00:01:54.400> have<00:01:54.550> any<00:01:54.760> editing<00:01:55.210> on<00:01:55.390> them<00:01:55.540> at

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
these barely have any editing on them at

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.390 
these barely have any editing on them at
all<00:01:55.840> because<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.260> light<00:01:56.409> was<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:56.860> incredibly

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
all because the light was so incredibly

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.250 
all because the light was so incredibly
soft<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.909> beautiful<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.600> looked<00:01:58.960> like<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.140> had

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
soft and beautiful it looked like I had

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.230 
soft and beautiful it looked like I had
already<00:01:59.560> retouched<00:02:00.159> them<00:02:00.340> before<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.729> even<00:02:00.940> did

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
already retouched them before I even did

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.580 
already retouched them before I even did
so<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.510> that's<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.780> power<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.110> having<00:02:02.229> a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
so and that's the power of having a

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.149 
so and that's the power of having a
really<00:02:03.659> great<00:02:04.659> even<00:02:05.320> light<00:02:05.560> source<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:05.979> puts

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
really great even light source that puts

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.980 
really great even light source that puts
out<00:02:06.430> really<00:02:06.790> soft<00:02:07.090> beautiful<00:02:07.330> light<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.870> you

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
out really soft beautiful light is you
