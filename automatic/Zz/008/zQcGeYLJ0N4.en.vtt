this huge inferno so the objective for

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.880 
this huge inferno so the objective for
you<00:03:21.820> as<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> player<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.540> basically<00:03:22.750> burn<00:03:23.620> up

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
you as a player is to basically burn up

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.280 
you as a player is to basically burn up
other<00:03:24.340> teams<00:03:24.700> supplies<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.110> end<00:03:26.170> of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
other teams supplies so in the end of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.190 
other teams supplies so in the end of
the<00:03:26.410> match<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:27.250> set<00:03:27.459> them<00:03:27.550> afire<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.180> then<00:03:28.930> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
the match you set them afire and then it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.680 
the match you set them afire and then it
you'll<00:03:30.010> be<00:03:30.160> active<00:03:30.370> after<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.390> call

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
you'll be active after that is to call

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.960 
you'll be active after that is to call
in<00:03:31.900> an<00:03:32.080> airplane<00:03:32.380> containing<00:03:33.220> gas<00:03:33.610> Arab

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
in an airplane containing gas Arab

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.790 
in an airplane containing gas Arab
putting<00:03:34.300> drops<00:03:34.570> down<00:03:34.840> gasoline<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.620> to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
putting drops down gasoline on to

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.410 
putting drops down gasoline on to
already<00:03:36.130> existing<00:03:36.250> files<00:03:36.820> from<00:03:37.000> creating

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
already existing files from creating

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.180 
already existing files from creating
then<00:03:37.540> for<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.050> device<00:03:38.620> time<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.890> blow<00:03:39.040> up

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
then for the device time to blow up

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.640 
then for the device time to blow up
basically<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.420> it's<00:03:40.630> fire<00:03:40.870> with<00:03:41.260> more<00:03:41.440> fire

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
basically so it's fire with more fire

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.670 
basically so it's fire with more fire
and<00:03:41.950> then<00:03:42.100> fire<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:43.150> mode<00:03:43.390> requires<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.470> lot

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
and then fire this mode requires a lot

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.530 
and then fire this mode requires a lot
more<00:03:44.709> coordination<00:03:45.520> than<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.090> other<00:03:46.239> modes

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
more coordination than the other modes

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.729 
more coordination than the other modes
talk<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> little<00:03:47.140> bit<00:03:47.290> about<00:03:47.380> some<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.620> the

talk a little bit about some of the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.170 
talk a little bit about some of the
efforts<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.100> players<00:03:48.700> are<00:03:48.820> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> have

teammates ensure success in firestorm

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.060 
teammates ensure success in firestorm
definitely<00:03:52.720> when<00:03:53.470> setting<00:03:53.709> out<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.890> create

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
definitely when setting out to create

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.010 
definitely when setting out to create
the<00:03:54.520> multiplayer<00:03:54.880> game<00:03:55.150> modes<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.690> had<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:55.989> a

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
the multiplayer game modes we had like a

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.340 
the multiplayer game modes we had like a
spectrum<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.610> like<00:03:58.570> normally<00:03:59.170> like

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
spectrum of the like normally like

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.810 
spectrum of the like normally like
domination<00:03:59.830> that<00:03:59.950> we<00:04:00.070> have<00:04:00.190> as<00:04:00.310> well<00:04:00.459> it's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
domination that we have as well it's

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.550 
domination that we have as well it's
like<00:04:01.000> we<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.300> all<00:04:01.450> our<00:04:01.480> team<00:04:01.780> play<00:04:01.989> features

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
like we have all our team play features

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.470 
like we have all our team play features
in<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.040> game<00:04:03.220> mode<00:04:03.400> but<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.060> game<00:04:04.300> mode

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
in that game mode but the game mode

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.680 
in that game mode but the game mode
itself<00:04:04.930> does<00:04:05.500> not<00:04:05.530> require<00:04:06.239> team<00:04:07.239> play<00:04:07.450> it's

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
itself does not require team play it's

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.240 
itself does not require team play it's
good<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.200> it's<00:04:08.290> incentive<00:04:08.800> because<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.160> gives

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
good and it's incentive because it gives

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.210 
good and it's incentive because it gives
you<00:04:09.400> an<00:04:09.489> edge<00:04:09.690> however<00:04:10.690> in<00:04:10.959> firestorm<00:04:11.709> it's<00:04:11.980> a

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
you an edge however in firestorm it's a

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.190 
you an edge however in firestorm it's a
much<00:04:12.459> more<00:04:12.489> of<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.970> requirement<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.930> win

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
much more of a requirement to win

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.640 
much more of a requirement to win
because<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.709> enemy<00:04:15.010> has<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:16.060> depose<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.660> when

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
because the enemy has to depose and when

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.470 
because the enemy has to depose and when
you<00:04:17.830> ignite<00:04:18.220> one<00:04:18.489> basically<00:04:18.940> set<00:04:19.150> on<00:04:19.269> fire

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
you ignite one basically set on fire

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.210 
you ignite one basically set on fire
it's<00:04:19.750> going<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:19.989> burn<00:04:20.109> for<00:04:20.470> X<00:04:20.890> amount<00:04:21.039> of

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
it's going to burn for X amount of

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.790 
it's going to burn for X amount of
seconds<00:04:22.229> leaving<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:23.350> with<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> window<00:04:23.770> of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
seconds leaving you with a window of

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.070 
seconds leaving you with a window of
opportunity<00:04:24.150> meaning<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.539> other<00:04:25.720> team

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
opportunity meaning that the other team

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.500 
opportunity meaning that the other team
that<00:04:26.110> you

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
that you

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.450 
that you
teammates<00:04:26.870> gonna<00:04:27.260> have<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.590> ignite<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.280> other

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
teammates gonna have to ignite the other

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.640 
teammates gonna have to ignite the other
one<00:04:28.760> while<00:04:29.240> back<00:04:29.420> on<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.690> burning<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.410> have

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
one while back on is burning so you have

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.070 
one while back on is burning so you have
to<00:04:30.770> work<00:04:30.920> together<00:04:31.100> more<00:04:31.940> than<00:04:32.000> one<00:04:32.210> person<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
to work together more than one person to

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.230 
to work together more than one person to
basically<00:04:33.440> have<00:04:33.680> both<00:04:34.040> nodes<00:04:34.760> burning<00:04:35.180> at

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
basically have both nodes burning at

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.910 
basically have both nodes burning at
same<00:04:35.420> time<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:36.020> hence<00:04:36.170> creating<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.590> virus

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
same time and hence creating a virus

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.820 
same time and hence creating a virus
once<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:37.820> firestorm<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.360> initiated<00:04:38.960> as<00:04:39.710> you

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
once the firestorm is initiated as you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.100 
once the firestorm is initiated as you
noticed<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.160> radio<00:04:40.750> sponsor<00:04:41.750> in<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.870> middle

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
noticed the radio sponsor in the middle

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
noticed the radio sponsor in the middle
and<00:04:42.200> then<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.560> match<00:04:43.240> switches<00:04:44.240> from<00:04:44.420> having

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
and then the match switches from having

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.840 
and then the match switches from having
four<00:04:45.020> active<00:04:45.260> notes<00:04:45.470> just<00:04:45.710> one<00:04:45.920> row<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.430> now

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
four active notes just one row and now

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.690 
four active notes just one row and now
like<00:04:47.240> everyone<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:48.170> entire<00:04:48.530> both<00:04:49.100> teams<00:04:49.400> just

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
like everyone and entire both teams just

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.400 
like everyone and entire both teams just
warm<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.210> one-point<00:04:50.720> creating<00:04:51.110> this<00:04:51.230> like

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
warm a one-point creating this like

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.310 
warm a one-point creating this like
racing<00:04:51.950> massacre<00:04:52.430> inside<00:04:53.330> inferno<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.170> it's

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
racing massacre inside inferno and it's

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.830 
goes and because we have that why mean
for<00:05:14.990> example<00:05:15.020> when<00:05:15.530> when<00:05:15.890> you<00:05:16.160> win<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.370> match<00:05:16.840> we
