track to see which of these Japanese
rice<00:00:45.660> Rockets<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> fastest<00:00:49.129> we've

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
rice Rockets is the fastest we've

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.830 
rice Rockets is the fastest we've
devised<00:00:50.460> three<00:00:50.760> tests<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.329> would<00:00:51.480> put<00:00:51.660> both

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
devised three tests which would put both

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080 
devised three tests which would put both
cars<00:00:52.170> through<00:00:52.440> their<00:00:52.590> paces<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:53.730> test<00:00:53.940> their

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
cars through their paces will test their

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
cars through their paces will test their
performance<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> test<00:00:55.379> their<00:00:55.590> handling

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
performance on the test their handling

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.099 
performance on the test their handling
and<00:00:56.250> finally<00:00:56.730> we'll<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:57.420> car<00:00:57.719> has<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and finally we'll see which car has the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
and finally we'll see which car has the
most<00:00:58.320> outright<00:00:58.890> grip<00:00:59.250> first<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.449> simple

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
most outright grip first up a simple

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:27.250 
most outright grip first up a simple
nought<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.199> 100<00:01:01.350> back<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.190> north<00:01:02.430> test

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.450 

and<00:01:28.260> not<00:01:28.470> only<00:01:28.500> did<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.250> hundred

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and not only did I get to a hundred

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.270 
and not only did I get to a hundred
quicker<00:01:30.050> but<00:01:31.050> he's<00:01:31.140> come<00:01:31.320> past<00:01:31.620> me<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
quicker but he's come past me so this is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.180 
quicker but he's come past me so this is
stopped<00:01:32.610> quicker<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.240> lost<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:34.800> a<00:01:34.830> tree

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
stopped quicker I lost that to a tree

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.010 
stopped quicker I lost that to a tree

so<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.290> first<00:01:37.590> blood<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> GTR<00:01:38.610> let's<00:01:39.360> see

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so it's first blood to the GTR let's see

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420 
so it's first blood to the GTR let's see
how<00:01:39.660> they<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.830> handling<00:01:41.190> test

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
how they get on in the handling test

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
how they get on in the handling test
which<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> slalom<00:01:42.540> against<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> rock

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290

okay<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.030> admit<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.930> GTR<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.800> faster

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
okay I admit that the GTR is the faster

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.820 
okay I admit that the GTR is the faster
