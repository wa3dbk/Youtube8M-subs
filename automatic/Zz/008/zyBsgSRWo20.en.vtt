00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.379
 I have to break junior today 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.840
 a play from the make n break family 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.609
 from ravensburger verlag magix 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.380
 principle is quite popular and so 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.910
 very well known sells quite well 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.859
 That's what my action looks like in every game 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.109
 we are just the latest litter with 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.759
 the target group children over five years 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.589
 one or the other was now one 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.630
 be a bit skeptical imagine ah 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.210
 yes the gameplay not only again 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.190
 cannibalized and maybe it is 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.079
 just a little rubbish yes 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.090
 and test is more accurate today 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.230
 now possible for the target audience and 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.180
 Maybe it is too 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.160
 somehow new element what the whole im 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.230
 principle a bit more exciting or 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.100
 new effects again 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.960
 just come in 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.780
 who, by the way, move even more sluggish 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.179
 Flag can also be our metal blade 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.530
 watch extreme in the video of the band and 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.280
 because a little bit of a look ahead 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.719
 wants to compare 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.339
 As I said, we'll come now 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.140
 I explain it to the game 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.140
 and then again and again a conclusion 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.259
 At the beginning of the game, all players get up 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.540
 on a a kit in a color 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.579
 then these stones become wise in the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.470
 Although built up vertically and 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.470
 as accessible to all players as possible 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.899
 The player's table without a kit must be here 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.220
 find an order kt there is 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.770
 So now I make a difference 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.110
 have this a little easier with three to 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.549
 four stones and here you have five to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.619
 Six stones installed 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.829
 so these red cards are something 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.659
 the difficulty can be harder 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.909
 Already adjust something as I said 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.740
 the non-active player covers one of the 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.049
 cards on and the other active ones 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.329
 Players are now building their stones here 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.280
 the bet was made to build the building 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.740
 you reach into the middle and take your own 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960
 beginners stand in front of themselves that goes 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.100
 until all the stones are out of the middle 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.079
 have been removed 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.880
 a player is always empty 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.789
 because there is always one stone less 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.229
 as an active player 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.119
 now it is looked at a player 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.340
 this building was properly addressed 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.649
 he has a victory chip if not then 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.020
 not happened now that one at 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.740
 grab his building interjects one may 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.420
 not even the white stone 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.310
 it happened that when withdrawing 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.600
 based and the building comes in 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.040
 In any case, you do not click 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.900
 Victory Point chip is allowed to stone 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.270
 but you keep readers if so 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.580
 no real building can show 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.140
 the player is not white at all 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.360
 got hold of more and more 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.400
 Foreigners built the building properly 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.590
 and it was just too late 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.600
 if he is allowed to play player wrong 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.400
 this player is not a time job here 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.650
 then get in the next round 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.260
 now the state player changes here 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.000
 The newly revealed one gets here 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.220
 get the kit of the next one 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.830
 player and this player then has the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.480
 reveal next card 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 that goes on until a player 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.570
 got ten victory points chips here 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.010
 the profit of the game and rejoices 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.480
 then there are also two players 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.340
 Variation here will be easy then 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.470
 alternately uncovered so everyone 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.640
 player must reveal a card once 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.460
 and then always has a small one 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.530
 disadvantage for who reveals who needed 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.910
 a bit longer and the tax is stone too 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.680
 The other one can already watch 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.700
 and start building that one can 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.500
 balance a little if you can 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.920
 maybe say with builds only when 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.380
 the card really is yes or the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.000
 put hands on thighs and 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.100
 then it's off to go and could 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.720
 make the car a bit fairer to me 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.610
 yes and then there is one last one 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.860
 Variation if you differ 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.600
 fast kids for example has then 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.460
 can one say it yes the faster ones 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.310
 now here are the slow ones 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.320
 Cattle how to build the yellow card and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.540
 the faster players have to go here 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.460
 Build this red building 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.930
 so you can have a bit of fairness and 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.490
 bring in justice so that 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.100
 slow players not so fast 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.080
 be frustrated 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.460
 yes that's the end of the game 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.460
 and now we come to the conclusion 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.890
 before I get something wrong 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.510
 I still want to say junior special 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.530
 was generally on the make or break principle 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.090
 to enter 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.620
 I have several players and drive 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.810
 She likes to teach 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.549
 the children's games dream round huge joy 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.140
 there just knows the scary high 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.060
 request character but also the 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.769
 great rejoicing because then find 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.630
 I also very valuable educational 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.190
 seen because here can by what 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.900
 Often , that often gets trained 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.699
 comes short but immensely important for 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.139
 the childlike development and it is the 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.280
 spatial perception the spatial 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.250
 imagination 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.199
 yes and I can really good here 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.210
 train and train and therefore through 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.949
 Teach that and parents 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.680
 recommend something in the direction 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.870
 want to do something comma to the game 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.970
 is considered normal to this particular 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.289
 version which is not just another set break 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.449
 always scary annoyed by this 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.400
 immensely long waiting times often with 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.020
 ten minutes had to watch like the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.320
 Building another could not do anything that was 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.490
 simply corrosive here it will be easy 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.349
 built at the same time that now wants to 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.210
 absolute the innovation I say yes that 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.699
 makes the game really better again 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.010
 everyone is betting at the same time 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.110
 Everyone has the same order card and 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.820
 each one is even employing the player 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.470
 this is the hate war second here 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.330
 card too, but it's only one 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.680
 maximum minute outside and already can 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.810
 he will join again so it will 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.130
 This is boring especially for a woman 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.110
 even the arc of tension just a lot 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.970
 higher because everyone is curious who gets 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.370
 Now worth the stones institute who 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.930
 builds properly and yes that makes it then 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.340
 times bought and already a lot 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.810
 she is drawing a lot more languages now 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.630
 and the length is the same with the others 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.729
 make n break so that was for whom is that 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.490
 now what axle ministers is it 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.510
 simply too little challenging for 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.099
 Children are the end of it 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.169
 then elementary school maybe will 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.669
 also a little challenger too 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.590
 boring work and primary school age 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.849
 it is absolutely appropriate for the 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.190
 five-year-old so I think it can 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.919
 can build by every five-year-old 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.020
 I just really adapted that 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.599
 this age and I really think so 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.250
 really good hit by me 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.900
 that was now the third and 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.490
 fourth graders I asked it was 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.760
 now not so difficult to light 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.830
 sometimes even can give played 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.510
 already play the red cards yes 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.190
 also this handycam variant he has 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.060
 no bother that butcher than 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.110
 slower or the stronger 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.520
 Challenge orders must build and 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.450
 but it was just the light build it was 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.160
 no problem 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.250
 and that was why it was really great 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.960
 variable usable 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.090
 so the material is again used 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.010
 in macray quality the class suitable 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.690
 it should be shorter or longer now 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.070
 simply also this donor find the 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.420
 I took really good care 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.820
 only there maybe two 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.800
 Slots heard when we go here 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.360
 you have to play handicap 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.380
 put cards on the table and it is 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.940
 then maybe for one or 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.100
 other players an overstrain of the 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.110
 looks upside down it can be the same 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.750
 Imagine correctly when building it 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.610
 So yes, you could do 2 more 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.990
 and then maybe a bit bigger 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.120
 or the other part a bit 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.680
 smaller and donor made wider then 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.470
 it would not have been a problem 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.330
 yes then i would say for people who 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.800
 quantity project to have the normal game 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.660
 they may not need it 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.070
 because here is really the residents 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.100
 is reduced so here is one 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.690
 one-color orders and it will 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.770
 just easier, however, have now 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.850
 through this competitive character 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.590
 which may well again 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.420
 is interesting and that is now 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.980
 what i say so i will like 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.870
 mix had from both play out 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.820
