00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 draw me a sailing boat for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 to draw a sailing boat is very 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:23.010
 easy starts first by drawing some 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:29.760
 vague traces then a very slightly 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.800
 rounded then draws the bow of the boat 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.719
 by drawing a line that follows the first 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.550
 line then joins the waves 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.320
 then draw the end of the boat trace 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 a parallel line to draw the top 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:51.170
 of the hull then draws the mast 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.170
 drawing a long double line 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.310
 then traces the bar of the mainsail 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.930
 by drawing a line doubled 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:10.190
 perpendicular then connect the bow 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.330
 of the boat and the mast by a very rounded 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.460
 then draw a rounded line that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.460
 goes up from the pro to the top of the mast 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.120
 traces then another very rounded 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 up down of humans and that's you got 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.229
 drawn the little sail of the boat trace 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 now a rounding over the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.759
 bar of the mainsail then draws 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.750
 by a rounded train from the bottom of the farmhouse 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.750
 to the top 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 finally draw a well rounded line of the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.940
 top of the mast towards the bar of the big 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.800
 sail and now you have just drawn the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.330
 great sail of your boat you can 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.700
 now draw a pennant to your 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.800
 boat and that's your sailing boat is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.800
 finished you can now color it
