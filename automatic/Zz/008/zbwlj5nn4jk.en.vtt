00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070

simple<00:01:57.110> yeah<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:57.500> meant<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:57.920> lot<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.100> me<00:01:58.310> at

starfish
um<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.330> guess<00:04:00.510> about<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:01.050> big<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.570> it<00:04:03.800> was

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
um I guess about that big and it was

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.380 
um I guess about that big and it was
like<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.160> bright<00:04:05.490> purple<00:04:05.910> kind<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.240> like

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
like this bright purple kind of like

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.580 
like this bright purple kind of like
that<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:08.010> was<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> beach<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.590> really

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
that and it was on the beach and really

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.250 
that and it was on the beach and really
far<00:04:10.800> from<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.070> tide<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> thought<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.140> would

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
far from the tide so I thought I would

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.900 
far from the tide so I thought I would
put<00:04:13.740> it<00:04:13.770> back<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.190> water<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.610> know<00:04:14.760> like

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
put it back in the water you know like

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.110 
put it back in the water you know like
be<00:04:15.570> nice<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.109> don't<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.670> I<00:04:17.700> was<00:04:17.880> trying

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
to pick it up it was really slimy and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.800 
to pick it up it was really slimy and
gross<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.579> was<00:04:20.700> twirling<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.390> around<00:04:21.450> with<00:04:21.780> a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.400 
gross so I was twirling it around with a
stick<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.640> eventually<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.730> got<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> water

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
stick and eventually it got in the water

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.340 
stick and eventually it got in the water
but<00:04:25.410> then<00:04:25.560> later<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.980> day<00:04:26.190> we<00:04:26.430> saw<00:04:26.730> a<00:04:27.350> seagull

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
but then later that day we saw a seagull

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.470 
but then later that day we saw a seagull
I<00:04:28.500> believe<00:04:28.740> was<00:04:29.010> flying<00:04:29.760> over<00:04:29.910> us<00:04:30.090> with<00:04:30.450> a

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
I believe was flying over us with a

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.330 
I believe was flying over us with a
starfish<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.230> its<00:04:31.380> mouth<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.010> was<00:04:32.100> just

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
starfish in its mouth and it was just

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.630 
starfish in its mouth and it was just
kind<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.990> was<00:04:33.990> really<00:04:34.350> funny<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:35.460> a

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
kind of I was really funny and just a

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.490 
kind of I was really funny and just a
good<00:04:35.850> day<00:04:36.060> so<00:04:36.480> that<00:04:36.780> kind<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.050> reminds<00:04:37.290> me<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
good day so that kind of reminds me of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.560 
good day so that kind of reminds me of
that<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.390> then<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:40.320> sunflower<00:04:41.100> is<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:42.240> bit

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that and then the sunflower is a bit

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.360 
that and then the sunflower is a bit
more<00:04:42.720> intense<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.940> while<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:44.970> was<00:04:45.360> in<00:04:45.540> treatment

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
more intense so while I was in treatment

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.909 
more intense so while I was in treatment
my<00:04:47.370> mom<00:04:47.550> had<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.760> miscarriage<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:49.620> blame

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
my mom had a miscarriage and I blame

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.270 
my mom had a miscarriage and I blame
myself<00:04:50.130> because<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:51.570> put<00:04:51.900> tons<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.620> stress<00:04:52.950> on

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
myself because I put tons of stress on

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.270 
myself because I put tons of stress on
her<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:54.540> months<00:04:54.780> before<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:55.169> just<00:04:55.590> with

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
her the months before that just with

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.080 
her the months before that just with
restricting<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.090> losing<00:04:57.330> weight<00:04:57.510> so<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:59.820> was

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
restricting and losing weight so it was

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.150 
restricting and losing weight so it was
a<00:05:00.480> pretty<00:05:00.540> difficult<00:05:01.260> thing<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.620> process

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
a pretty difficult thing to process

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.080 
a pretty difficult thing to process
through<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:03.050> there<00:05:04.050> was<00:05:04.169> one<00:05:04.410> day<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.830> just

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
through and there was one day I just

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.480 
through and there was one day I just
broke<00:05:06.090> down<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:08.160> just<00:05:09.150> thought<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:10.950> God

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
broke down and I just thought like God

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.760 
broke down and I just thought like God
would<00:05:11.790> please<00:05:12.330> give<00:05:12.540> me<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.720> sign<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:13.320> it's

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
would please give me a sign that it's

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.010 
would please give me a sign that it's
okay<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:15.140> immediately<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:17.340> Sun<00:05:17.850> came<00:05:18.630> in<00:05:18.660> it

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
okay and immediately the Sun came in it
