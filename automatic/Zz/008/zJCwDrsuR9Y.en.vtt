so<00:00:00.390> today<00:00:00.630> I'm<00:00:00.690> going<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.900> review<00:00:01.170> wailed

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
so today I'm going to review wailed

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.610 
so today I'm going to review wailed

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
you know the simulation market is just

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.549 
you know the simulation market is just

eating<00:00:18.420> simulations<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:19.949> about

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
eating simulations I think it's about

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.800 
eating simulations I think it's about
time<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.430> go<00:00:20.789> back<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> roots<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
time we go back to the roots of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.500 
time we go back to the roots of
simulator<00:00:22.320> games<00:00:22.680> where<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.609> started<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
simulator games where it all started you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120 
simulator games where it all started you
know<00:00:24.600> there's<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.019> many<00:00:25.170> great<00:00:25.439> whale

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
know there's so many great whale

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.240 
know there's so many great whale
simulations<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> eighth<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> 16-bit<00:00:28.710> era

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
simulations in the eighth and 16-bit era
the<00:00:30.119> games<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.689> grew<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.199> basically<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the games we grew up with basically so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.370 
the games we grew up with basically so
let's<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.759> an<00:00:33.180> homage<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.870> those

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
let's see if this is an homage to those

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.770 
let's see if this is an homage to those
great<00:00:34.680> simulator<00:00:35.219> classics<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.570> game

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
great simulator classics or just a game

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
great simulator classics or just a game
with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.260> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> pizzazz<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> lot<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
with a lot of pizzazz but not a lot of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.869 
with a lot of pizzazz but not a lot of
substance<00:00:39.960> let's<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> live<00:00:40.829> review<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.700> see

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
substance let's do a live review and see

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.900 
substance let's do a live review and see
ok<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> hand<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.640> looks<00:00:44.850> like

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
ok so I have the hand of what looks like

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.990 
ok so I have the hand of what looks like
a<00:00:45.030> robot<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:47.129> assuming<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.730> some

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
a robot here I'm I'm assuming I'm some

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.920 
a robot here I'm I'm assuming I'm some
kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.590> transformer<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.950> something<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
kind of transformer or something and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.180 
kind of transformer or something and
really<00:00:51.930> doesn't<00:00:52.230> matter<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> am<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.160> long

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
really doesn't matter what I am as long

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.610 
really doesn't matter what I am as long
as<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.670> pet<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> here's<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> course<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
as I can pet and here's of course a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
as I can pet and here's of course a
whale<00:00:55.910> now<00:00:56.910> yes<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.270> would<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.870> some

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
whale now yes I would have to be some

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
whale now yes I would have to be some
kind<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.410> giant<00:00:58.559> robot<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.820> whale

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
kind of giant robot because this whale

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.939 
kind of giant robot because this whale
is<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.359> half<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.780> size<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.590> let's<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> ahead

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
is about half my size but let's go ahead

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.149 
is about half my size but let's go ahead
and<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.870> mean<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> potato<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.739> meat

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and see the mean a potato of this meat

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
and see the mean a potato of this meat
and<00:01:05.309> potatoes<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.909> game<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> ow<00:01:06.360> petting

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and potatoes of this game the ow petting

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.190 
and potatoes of this game the ow petting
physics<00:01:07.439> let's<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:07.860> good<00:01:07.920> those<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
physics let's see how good those are and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
physics let's see how good those are and
okay<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.619> bad<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.610> petting<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
okay not bad at all I'm petting the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
okay not bad at all I'm petting the
whale<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> mean<00:01:14.100> already<00:01:14.400> we

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
whale right now so I mean already we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
whale right now so I mean already we
have<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> problem<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.689> whale<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
have a problem because it's a whale on

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
have a problem because it's a whale on
land<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.159> water<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.700> obviously<00:01:18.180> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
land and not in water so obviously I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.840 
land and not in water so obviously I
have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.350> points<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.009> clearly

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
have to take points off because clearly

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
have to take points off because clearly
this<00:01:21.390> game<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.369> representing<00:01:23.369> trans

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this game is not representing trans

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.770 
this game is not representing trans
women<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> other<00:01:25.610> ethno<00:01:26.610> sexual<00:01:27.210> minorities

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
women and other ethno sexual minorities

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.859 
women and other ethno sexual minorities
and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.500> feel<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> game<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.430> 2014<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.750> be

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and I feel like for a game in 2014 to be

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.440 
and I feel like for a game in 2014 to be
all<00:01:31.049> inclusive<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.920> has<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.520> include<00:01:32.880> everyone

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
all inclusive it has to include everyone

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
all inclusive it has to include everyone
and<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.439> straight<00:01:34.710> white<00:01:34.979> males<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and not just straight white males so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.270 
and not just straight white males so
five<00:01:36.030> points<00:01:36.450> off<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.840> also<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.009> trees

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
five points off for that also the trees

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800 
five points off for that also the trees
are<00:01:38.460> floating<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
are floating which is actually kind of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200 
are floating which is actually kind of
cool<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> gets<00:01:40.590> five<00:01:40.860> points<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.460> for

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
cool so it gets five points back for

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569 
cool so it gets five points back for
that<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:43.110> love<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> fact<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.829> this

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that I really love the fact that this

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.179 
that I really love the fact that this
game<00:01:44.790> doesn't<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.259> rules<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.890> physics

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
game doesn't go by the rules of physics

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.240 
game doesn't go by the rules of physics
or<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:48.000> any<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> gravity<00:01:49.560> laws<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.040> have

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
or or any kind of gravity laws we have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280 
or or any kind of gravity laws we have
here<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.610> earth<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.170> ahead

another<00:01:56.070> tree<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.729> floating<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.270> in

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
another tree can just be floating up in

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
another tree can just be floating up in
the<00:01:57.479> sky<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> game<00:01:58.200> doesn't<00:01:58.770> care<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> can

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
simulator it is also a robot fence

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.220

jumping<00:02:17.170> simulator<00:02:18.570> but<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.720> enjoy<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
jumping simulator but I do enjoy the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.960 
jumping simulator but I do enjoy the
fact<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.590> there's<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.040> whale<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.700> can

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
fact that there's a whale and you can

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.300 
fact that there's a whale and you can
pet<00:02:22.180> him<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.570> that's<00:02:22.960> really<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:24.070> need

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
in the well petting game I think this

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.860 
in the well petting game I think this
game<00:02:26.680> has<00:02:26.860> really<00:02:27.010> taken<00:02:27.340> advantage<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:28.210> ps4s

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
game has really taken advantage of ps4s

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.590 
game has really taken advantage of ps4s
processing<00:02:29.860> power<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.490> that's<00:02:31.150> why<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.390> gets

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
processing power and that's why it gets

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.020 
processing power and that's why it gets
