right here so I'm going to right-click
it<00:01:35.840> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> go<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.400> hit

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
remove so now we have just that bag when

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.429 
remove so now we have just that bag when
we<00:01:42.689> already<00:01:42.960> look<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:44.390> effect<00:01:45.439> it's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
we already look at it the effect it's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.510 
we already look at it the effect it's
already<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.189> faster<00:01:49.520> we

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
already going a little bit faster we

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
already going a little bit faster we
want<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.060> clip<00:01:51.299> go<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.930> lot<00:01:52.470> faster<00:01:52.680> we

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
want to make the clip go a lot faster we

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
want to make the clip go a lot faster we
want<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.430> effect<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.710> really

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
want the effect to make just go really

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
want the effect to make just go really
fast<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.969> guess<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
fast I guess that's kind of what the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.399 
fast I guess that's kind of what the
goal<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.549> go<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.810> hear<00:02:00.990> the
