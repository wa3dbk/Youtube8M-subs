00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.580
 in 1987 in mike tyson appeared the 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.619
 Nintendo with its own game but at 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.450
 side of his giant figure there was a 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.060
 little character that despite his 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.099
 size had a great spirit and douma 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.099
 that this is his biography 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.989
 all right 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.000
 have been for the first time in the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.450
 nintendo mike tyson video game a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.010
 show of the year 1937 and such marx was one of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.380
 the most forgotten characters by 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.740
 nintendo although with the arrival of the wii and 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.350
 wii 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.150
 what would he do after the name of this 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.520
 nice boxer would come to mean 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.620
 the little mac nickname that fits him like 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.810
 ring to the finger since he will have to fight 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.180
 against two other fighters who 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.130
 double or triple the size this in 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.050
 a principle was not thought like that anymore 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.790
 that Mr. Takeda's idea was that of 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.420
 move the original version of arcade 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.640
 that is to say a show of the year 1934 to the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.860
 nintendo nes however due to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.900
 limitations of a system of tweets was 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.180
 impossible that our boxer had 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.640
 its apparent spectrum instead of that 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.380
 decided to catch the character and so 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 to have a good perspective of the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.290
 opponent of only 17 years old 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.590
 comes from ebro foods new york despite 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.259
 107 pounds that is 49 kilograms and measures 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.420
 4 feet and eight inches that is to say near 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.340
 a meter 40 you have clear the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.899
 nationality of mac although some 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.140
 theories put it with a boxer 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.680
 Italian American 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.510
 mack is a disciple of Don Luis that gave 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.880
 he has not trained to become 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.480
 the best your attacks are pretty 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.400
 basic 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 we only have punches with our fists 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.780
 left or right towards the face or 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.520
 towards the stomach although more has a 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.800
 secret weapon under the sleeve 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.660
 the so-called no start over cut to which it was 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.370
 taught by don Luis and is usually a 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.650
 pretty useful movement along the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.570
 game according to the original story of 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.980
 punch out our little protagonist 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.350
 he has managed to defeat all his 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.660
 contenders even the world champion 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.560
 mike tyson or the lord dream according to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.560
 version to be played 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.569
 Y 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.379
 several decades passed until arrival 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.120
 of a wii chat which brought the peri 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.760
 boxer in green gloves who 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.310
 again beat the champion in that 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.319
 moment male man but little mac no 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.299
 only appeared in this saga but that 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.100
 he has also appeared in the requisition of 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.070
 Super Smash Bros 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.620
 his first appearance was the year 2008 in 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.900
 super smash bros brawl here also you 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.070
 appear as an assistant appears with a 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.070
 unlockable trophy 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.500
 for the next game in the series 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.060
 amateurs will be happy to know that in 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.099
 cow will appear as characters 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.750
 selectable with all your attacks of 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.239
 classic movements and that curiously 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.860
 is the only smash character released 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.200
 in fighting games proper 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.360
 There are two mentions made by fans 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.670
 but that given their nature are worthy 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.530
 The first is that the language 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.020
 who appears as the main villain in 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.300
 the video game fund made a vos big 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.880
 adventure a title full of references 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.200
 to the world of nintendo and the second 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.200
 to be popular internet meme 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.630

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.430
 that you 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.699

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.550
 mythical green gloves boxer 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.260
 appeared in lalin tendons there was 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.870
 forgotten by nintendo who in an act 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.340
 noble brought him back to life now 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.320
 with the appearance of the new super smash 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.449
