00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 certainly knows the practical 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.490
 life announcement among others with the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.620
 model in the casemod 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.000
 and i'll show you how in this video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.740
 It is possible in the change of minecraft 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 the lives of all players on one 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.460
 server and of course in the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 to show tap list the whole we do 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.520
 with the help of a scoreboard and for that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.920
 Let's take a look at these 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.529
 command blog there is in there / 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 scoreboard objectives at we add so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 Add a new scoreboard objective 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.210
 then we just call it like we do 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670
 I want to call you love the case 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.199
 and behind hellfeld means that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.730
 This scoreboard is practically addressed 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.079
 we will click on then and then 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 Just click on the button and you know 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.070
 here the new lens was added 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.780
 but it is not displayed yet 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.160
 if we press tab in the singleplayer 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 he really is not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.489
 will not react then 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.039
 we have to show it first and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.250
 We do that with scoreboard objectives 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.809
 sz display is lisbeth in the case that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.489
 we want to show a toplist and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 then behind it was yet living the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 scoreboard what we just created 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 Now we click here on liszt 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.390
 and on this button and probably us 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.460
 the scoreboard is now displayed now 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.080
 if we switch to the game mode 0 and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 can print now but you see 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.320
 Tap is still nothing 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.770
 nothing has to indicate here with life 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 do 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.860
 That's why we first have to get involved 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 give a bit of damage and already 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.280
 this is going to be easy here 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.869
 you would not do that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 it stays that way up here 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.850
 is displayed so you always briefly 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 People 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.119
 and then yours will be right here too 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 current life displayed here 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.869
 11 will be updated 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.040
 now other players on the server 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.360
 then that would be fine 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.320
 then that work of those 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.150
 accordingly also the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 life indicator would be displayed 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.729
 there are, however, also the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.049
 possibility to live extra 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.430
 and we'll do that now 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.710
 with this command blog here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 for that we give / effect behind it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.159
 our player took in the case hugo 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 30.10 then the effect again in the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.110
 case 22 then the time how long the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.189
 Effect should work so 10 and 5 the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.110
 live in the case 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.460
 and then we just click on it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.780
 on the button and then we get 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.070
 Now we have to live extra 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 quickly return to zero in the game 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.030
 change and you see the heart and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.590
 Sort accordingly accordingly 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.540
 many of us have a lot in the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.920
 Tap is on so this is not far 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.479
 survive them and that is real 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.649
 practically that we do not have the problem 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.049
 have that at the end of the whole 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.459
 screen is full and can also be here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.750
 We live off that as we said before 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.830
 everything works normally and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.420
 the effect should be the same again 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.380
 disappear and the whole thing will be 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.970
 also had up here 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.010
 if you want to remove the scoreboard 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.990
 does that also and quite 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 easy with the command / scoreboard 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.100
 objectives for move and behind it easy 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.750
 the name of the scoreboard objectives and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.460
 he was alive, we add on yet 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.720
 and now click on the button is that 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.580
 scoreboard we change already already 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.870
 again we see the game mode 0 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.310
 nothing at all and we can not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.390
 more tab press here in the singleplayer 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.220
 I hope in any case I could you 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.410
 so help a little and before 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.150
 all play this and show that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.500
 also live by others, among others 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.000
 make players a little easier 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 otherwise you will find links to the right 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.300
 another tutorial in which we show you 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.740
 we can easily find diamonds 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.420
 or you can find one right below 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.680
 quiet and though to our microphone in the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.180
 bread contains but if that you 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 you are also interested in being there 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.060
 Otherwise, there's always something like that 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.920
