just pop that right back in legs uh they
actually<00:03:49.500> don't<00:03:49.739> go<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.280> out<00:03:50.340> too<00:03:50.670> much

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
actually don't go in and out too much

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.500 
actually don't go in and out too much
you<00:03:51.239> can<00:03:52.170> see<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.560> there<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.850> they<00:03:54.360> go

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
you can see that right there and they go

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.940 
you can see that right there and they go
look<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.230> gloom<00:03:55.470> keeps<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:55.860> popping

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
look at that this gloom keeps on popping

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.920 
look at that this gloom keeps on popping
out<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.940> does<00:03:57.150> go<00:03:57.330> forward<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.780> back

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
out but it does go forward and back

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.780 
out but it does go forward and back
though<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.410> got<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.830> pop<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.160> in<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.489> lot<00:03:59.730> more

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
though I got to pop this in a lot more

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.220 
though I got to pop this in a lot more
either<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.959> stay<00:04:01.200> in

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
either it's not just going to stay in

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.610 
either it's not just going to stay in
right<00:04:01.650> I'm<00:04:02.340> not<00:04:02.610> too<00:04:02.790> sure<00:04:03.110> he's<00:04:04.110> got<00:04:04.260> double

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
right I'm not too sure he's got double

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.640 
right I'm not too sure he's got double
jointed<00:04:05.010> at<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.459> knees<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.870> leg<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.500> can

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
jointed at the knees the leg you can

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.509 
jointed at the knees the leg you can
actually<00:04:07.830> rotate<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.670> if<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.360> wanted<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.870> and

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
actually rotate it if you wanted to and

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.430 
actually rotate it if you wanted to and
as<00:04:11.519> far<00:04:11.700> as<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> foot<00:04:12.180> goes<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.930> goes<00:04:13.049> up<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
as far as the foot goes it goes up and

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.410 
as far as the foot goes it goes up and
down<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.950> he<00:04:14.430> does<00:04:14.580> have<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.910> ankle<00:04:15.239> rocker

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
down and he does have the ankle rocker

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.719 
down and he does have the ankle rocker
so<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:16.109> good<00:04:16.320> range<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.100> motion<00:04:17.310> of

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
so really good range of motion of

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.580 
so really good range of motion of
articulation<00:04:18.390> for<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.290> my<00:04:19.410> review

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
articulation for so this is my review

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.890 
articulation for so this is my review
for<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.100> Ultron<00:04:20.519> build<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.850> figure<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.299> here's

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
for the Ultron build a figure and here's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.480 
for the Ultron build a figure and here's
a<00:04:21.959> look<00:04:22.169> at<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.680> figures<00:04:22.860> right<00:04:23.160> here

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
a look at all the figures right here

a look at all the figures right here
from<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.910> series<00:04:24.360> now<00:04:24.990> overall<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.620> think<00:04:25.860> it's

any gripes well first of all there's a
little<00:04:44.210> size<00:04:44.330> comparison<00:04:44.360> you<00:04:45.080> can't<00:04:45.260> see

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410

Ultron is bigger than all the characters
and<00:04:47.240> slightly<00:04:47.780> bigger<00:04:48.050> than<00:04:48.430> bulldozer<00:04:49.430> but

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
and slightly bigger than bulldozer but

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.910 
and slightly bigger than bulldozer but
as<00:04:50.420> far<00:04:50.600> as<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.810> regular<00:04:51.170> characters<00:04:51.590> go<00:04:51.710> like

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
as far as the regular characters go like

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.010 
as far as the regular characters go like
the<00:04:52.010> six<00:04:52.250> inch<00:04:52.460> scale<00:04:52.700> once<00:04:52.970> he<00:04:53.120> is<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.300> lot<00:04:53.720> you

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
the six inch scale once he is a lot you

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.510 
the six inch scale once he is a lot you
know<00:04:54.110> bigger<00:04:54.350> over<00:04:54.590> them<00:04:54.740> he<00:04:54.800> does<00:04:54.980> tower<00:04:55.160> over

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
know bigger over them he does tower over

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.490 
know bigger over them he does tower over
them<00:04:55.670> now<00:04:56.180> as<00:04:56.420> far<00:04:56.540> as<00:04:56.600> gripes<00:04:56.930> go<00:04:57.110> for<00:04:57.380> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
them now as far as gripes go for the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.680 
them now as far as gripes go for the
figures<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.010> think<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:58.940> only<00:04:59.060> grabs<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.450> really

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
figures I think the only grabs I really

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.440 
figures I think the only grabs I really
had<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:00.170> just<00:05:00.920> that<00:05:01.100> they<00:05:01.310> were<00:05:01.370> lacking<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.270> a

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
had is just that they were lacking in a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.740 
had is just that they were lacking in a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
lot of accessories ant-man was the one

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.240 
lot of accessories ant-man was the one
that<00:05:05.990> surprised<00:05:06.290> me<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.620> most<00:05:06.650> because<00:05:06.980> he

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
that surprised me the most because he

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.070 
that surprised me the most because he
does<00:05:07.400> look<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.730> coolest<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.270> he<00:05:08.690> does<00:05:08.870> come
