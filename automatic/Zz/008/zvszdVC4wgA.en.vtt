legs out into a push-up position and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.509 
legs out into a push-up position and
then<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.830> is<00:00:43.890> where<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.250> add<00:00:44.370> the

then back so this is where we add the

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.850 
then back so this is where we add the
parkour<00:00:44.909> twist<00:00:45.180> we're<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.799> we're<00:00:46.799> gonna

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
parkour twist we're gonna do we're gonna

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.039 
parkour twist we're gonna do we're gonna
spin<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.159> legs<00:00:47.339> and<00:00:47.580> back<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.839> we're<00:00:48.960> gonna

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
spin the legs and back then we're gonna

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.530 
spin the legs and back then we're gonna
do<00:00:49.260> Q<00:00:49.620> mstrides<00:00:50.600> going<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.870> two<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.390> then<00:00:54.390> go

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
do Q mstrides going for two and then go

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.820 
do Q mstrides going for two and then go
back<00:00:54.720> into<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.080> bar<00:00:55.260> beat<00:00:55.850> down<00:00:56.960> extend<00:00:57.960> here

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
back into the bar beat down extend here

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.680 
back into the bar beat down extend here
and<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.549> we're<00:00:59.640> gonna<00:00:59.729> go<00:00:59.909> back<00:00:59.940> two<00:01:00.390> strides

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and then we're gonna go back two strides

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:14.789 
and then we're gonna go back two strides
so<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.760> keep<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.570> up

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.700 

so<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.399> get<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.640> idea<00:01:15.670> there<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.960> it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
so you get the idea there so it's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.200 
so you get the idea there so it's
important<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.130> we<00:01:18.250> do<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.460> QM<00:01:18.759> strike<00:01:19.000> right

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
important that we do the QM strike right

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.480 
important that we do the QM strike right
so<00:01:19.810> I'm<00:01:20.439> gonna<00:01:20.560> break<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.890> down<00:01:20.979> for<00:01:21.189> you<00:01:21.340> real

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
so I'm gonna break it down for you real

the way the cubes drive is one of the

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.319 
the way the cubes drive is one of the
best<00:01:29.710> ways<00:01:29.979> if<00:01:30.250> you're<00:01:30.850> interested<00:01:31.270> in

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
learning parkour the Kong vault it's one

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.609 
learning parkour the Kong vault it's one
of<00:01:33.819> the<00:01:33.880> best<00:01:34.060> ways<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.270> build<00:01:35.110> up<00:01:35.319> into<00:01:35.530> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
of the best ways to build up into the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.090 
of the best ways to build up into the
Congo<00:01:36.039> ball<00:01:36.159> also<00:01:36.399> develops<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.209> lot<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.450> core

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
Congo ball also develops a lot of core

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.819 
Congo ball also develops a lot of core
coordination<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.399> flexibility<00:01:40.329> so<00:01:40.929> with<00:01:41.709> the

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
coordination and flexibility so with the

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.850 
coordination and flexibility so with the
stride<00:01:42.100> we're<00:01:42.939> gonna<00:01:43.030> place<00:01:43.270> our<00:01:43.420> hands<00:01:43.860> in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
stride we're gonna place our hands in

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.010 
stride we're gonna place our hands in
front<00:01:45.100> not<00:01:45.490> shoulder-width<00:01:45.909> apart<00:01:46.020> we're

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
front not shoulder-width apart we're

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.770 
front not shoulder-width apart we're
gonna<00:01:47.110> lift<00:01:47.349> our<00:01:47.560> hips<00:01:47.709> up<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:49.179> carry<00:01:49.569> our
