cool although in all the pictures they
have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.320> shiny<00:00:46.680> Africa<00:00:47.250> sticker<00:00:47.579> here

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730

if<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.090> reason<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:48.660> doesn't<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:48.989> one

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
if for some reason one doesn't have one

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.900 
if for some reason one doesn't have one
which<00:00:49.770> does<00:00:49.980> actually<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.430> suck<00:00:50.730> because

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
which does actually really suck because

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
which does actually really suck because
it<00:00:51.000> does<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.510> missing<00:00:51.629> something

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it does look like it's missing something

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.010 
it does look like it's missing something
um<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> fill<00:00:54.420> meter<00:00:54.600> down<00:00:54.750> here

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
um so we do have a fill meter down here

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.830 
um so we do have a fill meter down here
which<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> quite<00:00:55.500> funny<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> goes<00:00:56.420> 175<00:00:57.420> 50

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
which is quite funny is it goes 175 50

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
which is quite funny is it goes 175 50
min<00:00:58.079> zero<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.829> suppose<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> good<00:00:59.730> thing

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
min zero I suppose it's a good thing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.860 
min zero I suppose it's a good thing
because<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> means<00:01:00.390> someone's<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
because it means someone's going to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.330 
because it means someone's going to
accidentally<00:01:01.320> fill<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> below<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> bottom<00:01:02.250> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
accidentally fill it below the bottom of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.860 
accidentally fill it below the bottom of
the<00:01:02.399> midline<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.480> pump<00:01:03.660> run

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the midline and have the right pump run

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
the midline and have the right pump run
dry<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> unneeded

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
dry but I do think it's kind of unneeded

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
dry but I do think it's kind of unneeded
firstly<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.570> mention<00:01:06.900> anyone<00:01:07.200> using

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
firstly because I mention anyone using

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
firstly because I mention anyone using
this<00:01:07.560> barrows<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> probably<00:01:09.000> fill

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this barrows it's going to probably fill

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
this barrows it's going to probably fill
it<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.570> least<00:01:09.689> halfway<00:01:09.960> anyway<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.100> also

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it up at least halfway anyway but also

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.800 
it up at least halfway anyway but also
you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.760> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.180> how<00:01:12.210> fill<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you can just kind of see how fill it is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
you can just kind of see how fill it is
by<00:01:13.049> looking<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> feel

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
by looking at it but I do think we feel

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.859 
by looking at it but I do think we feel
me<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.299> definitely<00:01:15.360> add<00:01:15.689> something

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
me it definitely add something

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.140 
me it definitely add something
appearance<00:01:16.350> wise<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.490> we've<00:01:17.580> also<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> fill

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
appearance wise so we've also got a fill

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.640 
appearance wise so we've also got a fill
port<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.110> love<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> feature

than having to have the tubes loosened
and<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.810> need<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and you actually need them got to put it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.460 
and you actually need them got to put it
out<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.340> say<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.780> using<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.140> case<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
out or say if you are using a case of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
out or say if you are using a case of
more<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.680> two<00:01:34.829> optical<00:01:35.009> bays<00:01:35.400> rather<00:01:36.150> than

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
more than two optical bays rather than

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.789 
more than two optical bays rather than
having<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.659> remove<00:01:37.020> whatever<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
having to remove whatever is in the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
having to remove whatever is in the
optical<00:01:38.100> Bay<00:01:38.189> above<00:01:38.430> its<00:01:38.610> gets<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> can

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
optical Bay above its gets to it you can

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
optical Bay above its gets to it you can
obviously<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.689> feel<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> front

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
obviously just feel it from the front

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
obviously just feel it from the front
and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.400> some<00:01:41.549> people<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.850> actually

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and I don't know some people do actually

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
and I don't know some people do actually
mod<00:01:42.240> their<00:01:42.420> cases<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> dedicated<00:01:43.380> fill

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
mod their cases to have a dedicated fill

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.710 
mod their cases to have a dedicated fill
port<00:01:44.070> then<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.180> love<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
port then I do just really love it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.889 
port then I do just really love it
um<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> does<00:01:47.640> stick<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.000> quite<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.540> um

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
um but it does stick out quite a lot um

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
um but it does stick out quite a lot um
so<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.860> using<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.250> case<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> door

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
so if you are using a case with a door

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
so if you are using a case with a door
say<00:01:51.149> something<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.899> frat<00:01:52.079> house<00:01:52.259> I'm

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
say something like the frat house I'm

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
say something like the frat house I'm
define<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.950> four<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> might<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.329> be

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
define are four then you might not be

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
define are four then you might not be
able<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> close<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> door<00:01:54.990> properly<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
able to close the door properly but I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.670 
able to close the door properly but I
will<00:01:55.829> check<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.869> also<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
will check for you I'm also because of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.990 
will check for you I'm also because of
the<00:01:58.770> field<00:01:58.950> port<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> doesn't<00:01:59.579> look<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.820> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the field port it doesn't look like you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700 
the field port it doesn't look like you
can<00:02:00.060> feel<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> bay<00:02:00.540> raised<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:00.869> more<00:02:01.049> than<00:02:01.140> 80%

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
can feel the bay raised up more than 80%

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.139 
can feel the bay raised up more than 80%
but<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> once<00:02:02.430> again<00:02:02.579> we'll<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.030> check

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
but you know once again we'll just check

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.080 
but you know once again we'll just check
that<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.630> um<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> undo<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.909> do

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that for you um so to undo it you do

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.070 
that for you um so to undo it you do
just<00:02:06.360> screw<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> arm<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.619> made<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.099> full<00:02:08.369> copper

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
just screw it arm is made a full copper

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.340 
just screw it arm is made a full copper
and<00:02:10.170> has<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.280> rubber<00:02:11.730> o-rings<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.510> solve<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and has two rubber o-rings to solve it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.630 
and has two rubber o-rings to solve it
from<00:02:13.470> leaking<00:02:13.770> when<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.070> open

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
from leaking when it's open

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.090 
from leaking when it's open
you've<00:02:15.180> also<00:02:15.390> got<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:15.990> full<00:02:16.320> copper<00:02:16.650> ante

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
you've also got two full copper ante

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.360 
you've also got two full copper ante
vortex<00:02:17.520> caps<00:02:17.820> inside<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> top<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:19.980> we

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
vortex caps inside so at the top here we

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
vortex caps inside so at the top here we
do<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.820> recess<00:02:21.270> bit<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.780> perfect

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
do have this recess bit which is perfect

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.810 
do have this recess bit which is perfect
for<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.530> 10<00:02:22.740> centimeter<00:02:22.980> cathode<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> do

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
for a 10 centimeter cathode and I do

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.520 
for a 10 centimeter cathode and I do
really<00:02:24.060> love<00:02:24.240> customization<00:02:25.020> options<00:02:25.320> like

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
really love customization options like

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.650 
really love customization options like
that<00:02:25.740> there's<00:02:26.490> also<00:02:26.640> these<00:02:26.880> four<00:02:27.180> holes<00:02:27.450> at

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that there's also these four holes at

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.870 
that there's also these four holes at
the<00:02:27.720> back<00:02:27.900> two<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.650> side<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.160> two<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the back two on this side and two on

the back two on this side and two on
this<00:02:30.060> side<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.390> do<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.780> look<00:02:30.930> perfect

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
this side that do actually look perfect

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.560 
this side that do actually look perfect
for<00:02:31.770> LED<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.550> they<00:02:32.790> don't<00:02:32.970> actually<00:02:33.150> go

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
for LED so they don't actually go

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.390 
for LED so they don't actually go
anywhere<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> don't<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.950> clue<00:02:35.220> what

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
anywhere so I don't have a clue what

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520 
anywhere so I don't have a clue what
they're<00:02:35.580> for<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.050> see<00:02:37.080> where<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
they're for on but you can see where you

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.940 
they're for on but you can see where you
fit<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.130> five<00:02:38.370> pumps<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.800> Bay

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
fit the to do five pumps now of this Bay

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.140 
fit the to do five pumps now of this Bay
Rays<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.520> option<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.030> either

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
have just cut it with one pump already

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.949 
have just cut it with one pump already

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
suppose they're not really separate but

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.400 
suppose they're not really separate but
you<00:02:56.910> do<00:02:57.030> get<00:02:57.240> blanks<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.080> inlet<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
you do get blanks for the inlet and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.900 
you do get blanks for the inlet and
outlet<00:02:58.770> you're<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.010> using<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.760> and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
outlet you're not using if you do and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.480 
outlet you're not using if you do and
use<00:03:00.030> one<00:03:00.240> pump<00:03:00.450> now<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.380> course<00:03:01.590> any<00:03:01.770> d5<00:03:02.220> pump

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
use one pump now of course any d5 pump

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.010 
use one pump now of course any d5 pump
will<00:03:02.670> work<00:03:02.820> with<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.660> one<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.900> get

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
will work with this but the one you get

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.460 
will work with this but the one you get
with<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.950> ethical<00:03:05.430> VPP<00:03:05.940> 6<00:03:06.510> 5<00:03:06.750> 5<00:03:06.930> C<00:03:07.200> pump

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
with it is the ethical VPP 6 5 5 C pump

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.900 
with it is the ethical VPP 6 5 5 C pump
then<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.860> got<00:03:08.010> five<00:03:08.340> different<00:03:08.490> speed

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
then it's got five different speed

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.000 
then it's got five different speed
settings<00:03:09.110> although<00:03:10.110> I'd<00:03:10.350> imagine<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:10.920> more

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
settings although I'd imagine it's more

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.310 
settings although I'd imagine it's more
like<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.610> volume<00:03:12.300> dial<00:03:12.510> where<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:12.990> have<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
like a volume dial where you can have it

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.720 
like a volume dial where you can have it
in<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.470> middle<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> setting<00:03:14.160> say<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.610> like

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
in the middle of a setting say it like

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.990 
in the middle of a setting say it like
three<00:03:14.970> point<00:03:15.209> five<00:03:15.450> five<00:03:15.959> um<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.800> am<00:03:17.610> thinking

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
three point five five um I am thinking

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.640 
three point five five um I am thinking
of<00:03:18.120> having<00:03:18.239> running<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.900> too<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.200> think<00:03:19.440> that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
of having running it too I think that

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.870 
of having running it too I think that
would<00:03:19.860> be<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> good<00:03:20.400> balance<00:03:20.760> between

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
would be like a good balance between

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.390 
would be like a good balance between
noise<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.660> performance<00:03:22.170> might<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.310> run

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
noise and performance might have to run

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.060 
noise and performance might have to run
it<00:03:23.519> louder<00:03:23.670> I'm<00:03:23.850> not<00:03:24.000> sure<00:03:24.180> um<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.680> pump<00:03:25.920> is

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
it louder I'm not sure um the pump is

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.130 
it louder I'm not sure um the pump is
powered<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.580> really<00:03:26.970> long<00:03:27.150> mode<00:03:27.330> X<00:03:27.510> cable<00:03:27.959> so

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
powered by a really long mode X cable so

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.000 
powered by a really long mode X cable so
you<00:03:28.230> might<00:03:28.350> have<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.500> problem<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:28.890> not

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
you might have a problem with it not

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.650 
you might have a problem with it not
reaching<00:03:29.400> anywhere<00:03:29.610> but<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.360> means<00:03:30.480> you've

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
reaching anywhere but it means you've

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.600 
reaching anywhere but it means you've
got<00:03:30.780> more<00:03:30.810> cable<00:03:31.320> manage<00:03:31.590> you've<00:03:32.190> also<00:03:32.340> got<00:03:32.580> a

got more cable manage you've also got a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.220 
got more cable manage you've also got a

are black and braided will actually be

are black and braided will actually be
really<00:03:41.940> picky<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.220> temporarily

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
really picky so I have not temporarily

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
fit the Bay Rays and somewhere too fine

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.740 
fit the Bay Rays and somewhere too fine
are<00:03:46.350> four<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.860> does<00:03:47.010> fit<00:03:47.250> perfectly<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
are four and it does fit perfectly and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.120 
are four and it does fit perfectly and
the<00:03:48.870> door<00:03:49.019> stuffs<00:03:49.350> still<00:03:49.500> pretty<00:03:49.739> much<00:03:49.890> closed

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the door stuffs still pretty much closed

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.400 
the door stuffs still pretty much closed
completely<00:03:50.459> which<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:50.970> good<00:03:51.180> now<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.290> case

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
completely which is good now in a case

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.930 
completely which is good now in a case
like<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.950> am<00:03:53.040> very<00:03:53.070> grateful<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
like this I am very grateful for the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.490 
like this I am very grateful for the
front<00:03:54.180> fill<00:03:54.390> port<00:03:54.600> although<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.170> did<00:03:55.320> notice

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
front fill port although I did notice

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.380 
front fill port although I did notice
while<00:03:55.769> filling<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.310> because<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> whole<00:03:57.239> width

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
while filling it because the whole width

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.970 
while filling it because the whole width
so<00:03:57.570> small<00:03:57.870> see<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> edge<00:03:58.470> trying<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.830> escape

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
so small see the edge trying to escape

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.800 
so small see the edge trying to escape
while<00:03:59.310> you're<00:03:59.459> filling<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.209> unless<00:04:00.630> you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
while you're filling it and unless you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.810 
while you're filling it and unless you
do<00:04:00.930> fill<00:04:01.080> it<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.440> slowly<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.220> will<00:04:02.430> be

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
do fill it really slowly it will be

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.220 
do fill it really slowly it will be
quite<00:04:03.060> messy<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.570> I'd<00:04:03.630> actually<00:04:03.930> get<00:04:04.019> some

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
quite messy and I'd actually get some

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.350 
quite messy and I'd actually get some
water<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.769> between<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.640> two<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:06.000> plastic

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
water in between the two of plastic

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180 
water in between the two of plastic
faces<00:04:06.780> which<00:04:06.930> doesn't<00:04:07.200> look<00:04:07.320> great<00:04:07.440> but<00:04:07.560> you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
faces which doesn't look great but you

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.680 
faces which doesn't look great but you
can<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.519> undo<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.880> full<00:04:09.060> bolts<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.540> glue

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
can just undo the full bolts and glue

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.570 
can just undo the full bolts and glue
behind<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.350> want<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.799> was<00:04:11.489> actually

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
behind it if you want I was actually

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.340 
behind it if you want I was actually
surprised<00:04:12.060> by<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.299> how<00:04:12.540> high<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:13.110> fill

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
surprised by just how high you can fill

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.660 
surprised by just how high you can fill
it<00:04:13.470> around<00:04:13.799> 90%

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
it around 90%

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.580 
it around 90%
although<00:04:15.299> demotion<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:15.810> quite<00:04:16.019> hard<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.440> get

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
although demotion it's quite hard to get

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.320 
although demotion it's quite hard to get
rid<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.769> any<00:04:16.919> excess<00:04:17.310> air<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.209> what

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
rid of any excess air like this so what

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.610 
rid of any excess air like this so what
I'd<00:04:18.450> recommend<00:04:18.479> doing<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.140> really<00:04:19.260> filling

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
I'd recommend doing is really filling

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.039 
I'd recommend doing is really filling
it's<00:04:19.739> from<00:04:19.859> our<00:04:19.979> 50%<00:04:20.280> I'm<00:04:20.820> getting<00:04:21.630> all<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
it's from our 50% I'm getting all of the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:22.840 
it's from our 50% I'm getting all of the
air<00:04:22.169> out<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.500> loop

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
air out of your loop

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.090 
air out of your loop
then<00:04:23.000> filling<00:04:23.270> up<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.480> rest<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.780> way<00:04:24.140> also

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
then filling up the rest of the way also

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.830 
then filling up the rest of the way also
you<00:04:25.160> think<00:04:25.430> lay<00:04:25.580> coolant<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.240> quite<00:04:26.480> hard<00:04:26.720> to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
you think lay coolant is quite hard to

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.480 
you think lay coolant is quite hard to
see<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.140> film<00:04:27.320> winds<00:04:27.500> up<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:27.890> with<00:04:28.040> fuse<00:04:28.310> and

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
see the film winds up but with fuse and

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.980 
see the film winds up but with fuse and
coloured<00:04:28.730> arm<00:04:29.150> call<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.660> imagine<00:04:29.960> it

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
coloured arm call and I imagine it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.740 
coloured arm call and I imagine it
stands<00:04:30.260> out<00:04:30.410> quite<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.680> lot

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
stands out quite a lot

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.030 
stands out quite a lot
looking<00:04:32.750> at<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.960> back<00:04:33.170> despite<00:04:33.560> how<00:04:33.860> long

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
looking at the back despite how long

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680 
looking at the back despite how long
favors<00:04:34.490> look<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:34.970> doesn't<00:04:35.150> matter<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.450> can't

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
favors look so doesn't matter you can't

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.360 
favors look so doesn't matter you can't
pass<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.990> back<00:04:36.140> of<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.350> optical<00:04:36.740> bay<00:04:36.860> area

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
pass the back of the optical bay area

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.130 
pass the back of the optical bay area
now<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.120> pump<00:04:38.360> is<00:04:38.510> actually<00:04:38.720> what<00:04:39.020> really

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
now the pump is actually what really

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.290 
now the pump is actually what really
well<00:04:39.380> hidden<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.830> looks<00:04:40.010> really<00:04:40.220> good<00:04:40.460> and

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
well hidden so it looks really good and

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.610 
well hidden so it looks really good and
the<00:04:41.420> cables<00:04:41.780> are<00:04:41.870> quite<00:04:42.020> easy<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.440> kind<00:04:42.590> of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
the cables are quite easy to kind of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.930 
the cables are quite easy to kind of
tuck<00:04:42.830> away<00:04:42.980> so<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.400> doesn't<00:04:43.610> really<00:04:43.670> matter

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
tuck away so it doesn't really matter

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.040 
tuck away so it doesn't really matter
that<00:04:44.030> they're<00:04:44.270> not<00:04:44.360> braided

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
that they're not braided

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.960 
that they're not braided
I<00:04:45.080> do<00:04:45.650> imagine<00:04:45.980> it<00:04:46.280> could<00:04:46.370> look<00:04:46.520> quite<00:04:46.760> messy

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
I do imagine it could look quite messy

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.340 
I do imagine it could look quite messy
and<00:04:47.210> be<00:04:47.330> quite<00:04:47.540> hard<00:04:47.810> for<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.110> get<00:04:48.230> it

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
and be quite hard for you to get it

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.930 
and be quite hard for you to get it
looking<00:04:48.530> nice<00:04:48.710> if<00:04:48.980> you<00:04:49.100> are<00:04:49.190> having<00:04:49.370> force<00:04:49.730> you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
looking nice if you are having force you

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.390 
looking nice if you are having force you
running<00:04:50.330> into<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.630> bay<00:04:50.780> res<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.710> personally<00:04:52.370> I

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
running into the bay res so personally I

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.220 
running into the bay res so personally I
would<00:04:52.700> just<00:04:52.730> use<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.240> one<00:04:53.420> pump<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.050> two

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
would just use it of one pump I have two

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.410 
would just use it of one pump I have two
tubes<00:04:54.500> coming<00:04:54.770> out<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:56.270> then<00:04:56.390> again

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
tubes coming out of it but then again

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.320 
tubes coming out of it but then again
I've<00:04:56.690> never<00:04:56.720> really<00:04:57.110> liked<00:04:57.230> complex<00:04:57.650> loops

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
I've never really liked complex loops

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.760 
I've never really liked complex loops
now<00:04:59.330> one<00:04:59.510> thing<00:04:59.660> that<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.840> did<00:04:59.990> notice<00:05:00.170> is<00:05:00.350> it<00:05:00.650> is

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
now one thing that I did notice is it is

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.380 
now one thing that I did notice is it is
near<00:05:01.010> run<00:05:01.160> impossible<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.850> change<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.180> speed

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
near run impossible to change the speed

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.910 
near run impossible to change the speed
settings<00:05:02.780> on<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.990> pump<00:05:03.200> with<00:05:03.380> it<00:05:03.500> like<00:05:03.680> this

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
settings on the pump with it like this

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.160 
settings on the pump with it like this
um<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.150> want<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.390> make<00:05:05.510> sure<00:05:05.540> that<00:05:05.870> is<00:05:06.020> it

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
um so you want to make sure that is it

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.750 
um so you want to make sure that is it
speed<00:05:06.410> you're<00:05:06.620> happy<00:05:06.920> with<00:05:07.070> before<00:05:07.520> building

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
speed you're happy with before building

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.640 
speed you're happy with before building
the<00:05:07.970> loop<00:05:08.150> otherwise<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.170> have<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.410> either

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
the loop otherwise you have to either

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.200 
the loop otherwise you have to either
have<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:10.040> tubes<00:05:10.310> are<00:05:10.490> really<00:05:10.700> long<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:11.120> be

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
have the tubes are really long to be

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.430 
have the tubes are really long to be
able<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.360> pull<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.630> out<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:11.870> change<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.170> speed

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
able to pull it out and change the speed

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.320
