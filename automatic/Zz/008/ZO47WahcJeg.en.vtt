 28th minute of the first half jordi 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.470
 Queen with knee next to ciro 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.860
 dangerous queen of the players of peru 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.930
 gets angry well remember that the term 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.300
 of a queen party has a section 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.970
 partner but good is a knee 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.470
 when he formulates a recovery in the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.279
 half of the court of the Peruvian team 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.160
 the last line of ecuador opened not 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.110
 organization the ball entered filtered 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.239
 perfectly qualified ninth jordi 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.879
 that with its speed its mischief and its 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.129
 talent and got a diagonal missing and here 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.050
 he got rid of the stone archer and 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.160
 with a smooth definition when 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.019
 apparently it seemed that the last 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.050
 colored man could get to touch that 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.050
 ball arrive 2 to 0 2 poured 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.920
 we had said Ecuador depends a lot on 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.540
 what they do number 10 and now it has 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.870
 done very well the actress recovering a 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.520
 ball between three the claw of the captain 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.910
 I had tried left-handed but now 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.400
 read is nailed a phenomenal right 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.000
 to the left angle of the goalkeeper 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 unassailable for fields 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.900
 but defends bad they get confused they go wrong 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.420
 shorten 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.700
 and the touches are playing havoc with 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 the bottom or the second half of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.830
 Ecuadorian group finally appears 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.390
 user again the number 10 touching 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.580
 for parral is opening the ball to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 be and since this time it could accommodate 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.640
 the ball and have fast is opportunistic 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.700
 as well 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.520
 at the hand of the stone archer who has 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.670
 that he had to enter by supplanting the one 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.920
 he was a holder was to give a law he had 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.290
 done well but here the itch 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.170
 leaves him badly alone at number 22 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.409
 You know that last pique was wrong 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.890
 overcomes hands and has kind was in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.890
 the right moment
