00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.739
 Y 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 and 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.070
 i 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.070
 ah 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.470
 or not 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.520
 We continue with our drinks 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.140
 creamy point that you remember is a little bit 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.300
 beyond the snow point and in addition 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.700
 We are talking about milk drinks 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.430
 that adds at that creamy point and something 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.800
 drinks that contain ice cream such is the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 case of the shake that we are going to prepare 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.850
 below in this presentation that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.640
 we have been driving throughout the course 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.250
 of 12 ounces this time we're going to 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.180
 use an ice cream and for that 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.370
 We need a spoonful of the number 16 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.350
 which previously wet for 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.020
 have the facility that we are not 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.350
 paste with the water we will add it to the 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.980
 blender here the risk would be that it 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.310
 too much ice and that the drink is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.860
 too cold and the people have then 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.810
 headache because of that why not 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.330
 it is advisable we are going to put two balls 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.820
 on this side the ice cream is going to add 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.440
 a creaminess behind this time 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.810
 Well, we are talking about a 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.690
 chocolate milkshake but it could be 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.110
 some other type of milkshake from another 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.740
 completely different flavor later 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.500
 let's 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.680
 add milk and this time they are 8 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.720
 ounces of milk 8 ounces and a half we could 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.850
 add neutral base but do not 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.330
 we recommend because there is already a fat in 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.150
 the ice cream that exists a creaminess 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.290
 added by the ice cream and it is not necessary 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.020
 inject more then say creaminess 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.690
 already has enough creaminess that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.880
 we are looking for let's grind the go 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.650
 to liquefy to the creamy point that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.040
 We are looking for everything integrated 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.830
 around 30 to 32 seconds was in 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.840
 this takes and we're going to serve at the end 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.070
 we can decorate the glass with any 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.140
 type also of strawberry syrup or in 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.720
 this chocolate case we could do it 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.060
 so that a very shake is left 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.360
 smart here you see that you are not 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.910
 leaving the ice if you will look for a 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.280
 point a little more mopped of some 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.740
 way I could add a little bit of 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.470
 ice for the texture without leaving 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.550
 too cold we end up only with 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.550
 a small amount of whipped cream 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.400
 already with a cookie or another type of 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.840
 things and even cinnamon could be left 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.240
 very good in this case 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.060
 cocoa could look great and that 's it 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.680
 ready our milkshake and served 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.130
 immediately and goes to the table 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.940
 we finished with a little cinnamon and 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.940
 she is ready 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.530
 ah 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.530
 alive 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 before 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.980
 Hello
