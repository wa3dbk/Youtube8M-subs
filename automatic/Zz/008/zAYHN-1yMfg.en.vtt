00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.279
 Y 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.080
 today we bring you to our screens 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.760
 from trailers television a car that 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.530
 the truth is that we really wanted 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.119
 to try we have always received many 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.530
 requests from all subscribers and 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.930
 people that you have been doing 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.820
 comments through the area 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.109
 comments from youtube 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.570
 it seems that we focus too much 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.490
 in European cars and you wanted something 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.190
 Japanese when it comes to looking for a car 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.789
 Japanese played having the nissan gt is a 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.850
 car created especially to beat in 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.680
 its moment 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.109
 that had the 911 porsche turbo in the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 nÃ¼rbÃ¼rgring circuit that did it and 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.710
 for us within our of 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.480
 our little government in our 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.250
 small state as there have been certain 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.159
 certain internal bids to see which one 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.559
 we try such in the end we do not have the 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.719
 times of the 911 turbo s we do not have the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.089
 Ferrari 458 times and therefore 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.559
 we wanted before jumping to those 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.320
 cars we wanted to take a step back 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.440
 go to two years before and have this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.440
 nissan gt-r 485 horses 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.690
 this car looks like it's 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.370
 of a manga not only do we have to 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.950
 let's sit there inside and let's see all the 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.690
 type of screens you have you can 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.409
 configure absolutely everything seems that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.820
 you have a good playstation I go back to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.710
 say a little bit the usual not wanting 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.390
 to try it on this circuit that is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.760
 our house of the jarama circuit 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.560
 and let's see what I have 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.000
 my doubts that can bring down the times 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.580
 of porsche 911 turbo pdk but here 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 we are for to try to beat them and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.390
 let's see if it's like that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.760
 it's a pass like another action 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.829
 he had a lot but this is serious is also 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.260
 the feeling because that is much more 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:24.180
 big then 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 impacts and impacts first because yes 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.160
 notes the mass a lot of mass that moves 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.260
 they are noticing it and you know when with the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.190
 porsche it seems that you play more with this 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.420
 you have the feeling of being in a 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.380
 danger space a little beyond 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.160
 but nevertheless the super effective 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.690
 then it is how to surpass a little what 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.690
 what your instinct tells your head 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.510
 to me 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.140
 i 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.450
 as I move forward 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.980
 one 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.350
 getting under the rim
