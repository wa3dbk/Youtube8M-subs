00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.010
 welcome back today we are always here at 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.480
 talk about the Casio world and a new one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:20.580
 rather modern clock model yes 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 deals with the db 360 gn 9 aef clock 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.680
 we say that it is recently considered a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.429
 how fashionable given the fact that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.719
 just as gold gold as can be well 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.930
 see watch that also features 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.040
 LED light through the appropriate key 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.920
 flight this side and what we say 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 various functions, first of all, as can be well 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 see from the writing that is in first 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.899
 piano is a multilingual clock in the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.039
 meaning that can be used in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.780
 various languages ​​that are proposed 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.140
 within the same and between these 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.039
 there is also the Italian is a databank in the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 sense that we have the possibility of 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.070
 registration of telephone numbers 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.470
 or of codes within the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 same clock and on the screen 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.310
 main coming this we have 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.220
 indication of the day Saturday 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.570
 indication of the time that can be 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 be informed 24 hours you are informed 12 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.250
 hours the day and month indication 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.009
 and the year on the left is a clock 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.470
 that telemeno databank of as many as 30 sets of 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.700
 data by names and by telephone numbers 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 with characters that are considered up 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.180
 at a number of 8 and up to 12 digits 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 let's say this is quite convenient 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.720
 function especially at times when 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.800
 we must for example have 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.350
 a code at hand for example 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.720
 a phone number and we don't want that 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.490
 others know this for example 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.250
 it can be one of its functions 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.220
 but let's get to the other functions here 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.020
 this is the databank for example that there 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.450
 sorry excuse here is the bank that 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:25.340
 allows us to precisely record 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:28.540
 enter several different numbers that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.180
 coming to the function instead that it is 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.200
 we have an alarm clock 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.270
 up to the possibility of inserting well 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 think 5 alarm clocks with the indication 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.430
 always present the timetable below is 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.540
 a fairly convenient function this 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.959
 here to always have the timetable 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.970
 overlay for a whole series of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.800
 reasons for practicality over the course 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.260
 of the time setting not 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.650
 we can have 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.530
 moreover we say that this watch is 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.510
 also equipped with a second time zone 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.530
 we can see the so-called here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.140
 dual time and dual time 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.470
 which allows the display of a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.180
 second time in the world ours 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.310
 choice is always clearly with 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.870
 the indication of our current time 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.570
 below on the left then we have the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.799
 stopwatch functions and functions of 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.570
 timer what to say about this watch and a 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.810
 quite complete clock reading 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.750
 of the screen is very clear and in addition to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.290
 be equipped with the classic keys 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.100
 side we can see here 1 2 3 4 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.060
 6 4 side buttons 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:53.750
 let's go also the two small keys that they are 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.600
 different and awards that just forward e 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.780
 I wanted to say sorry I'm on the side 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.780
 front 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.990
