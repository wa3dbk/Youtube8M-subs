00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
watching YouTube videos i also want to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
watching YouTube videos i also want to
talk<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.730> processor<00:00:45.300> i<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
talk about the processor i think that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
talk about the processor i think that
Apple<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.559> use<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> a5x<00:00:47.489> processor

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
Apple is gonna use the a5x processor

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
Apple is gonna use the a5x processor
from<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> iPad<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> rock-solid

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
from the iPad because it's a rock-solid

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
from the iPad because it's a rock-solid
processor<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> apple<00:00:51.660> doesn't<00:00:51.870> need<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.440> use

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
processor and apple doesn't need to use

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
processor and apple doesn't need to use
any<00:00:52.710> difference<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.300> many<00:00:54.480> apps

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
any difference not really that many apps

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
any difference not really that many apps
are<00:00:55.020> already<00:00:55.289> taken<00:00:55.590> advantage<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> dual

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
are already taken advantage of the dual

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.180 
are already taken advantage of the dual
core<00:00:56.879> processor<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> iphone<00:00:58.020> 4s<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.890> why

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
core processor in the iphone 4s so why

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.119 
core processor in the iphone 4s so why
would<00:00:59.430> Apple<00:00:59.820> put<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> quad-core<00:01:01.140> chip<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
would Apple put a quad-core chip in a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070 
would Apple put a quad-core chip in a
phone<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.969> gonna<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.750> much

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
phone that's not gonna use that much

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
phone that's not gonna use that much
power<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.680> think<00:01:05.189> apple<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.489> gonna<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
power I think apple is gonna use the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
power I think apple is gonna use the
quad<00:01:06.360> core<00:01:06.570> capabilities<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.350> their<00:01:07.530> phones

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
quad core capabilities on their phones

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.570 
quad core capabilities on their phones
as<00:01:07.950> soon<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.119> find<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.869> reason<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> Apple

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
as soon as they find a reason to Apple

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
as soon as they find a reason to Apple
is<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> company<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> brags<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.110> specs

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
is not a company that brags about specs

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.760 
is not a company that brags about specs
it's<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.189> company<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.850> delivers<00:01:15.030> quality

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
it's a company that delivers quality

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.960 
it's a company that delivers quality
next<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.310> hope<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.580> Apple<00:01:17.909> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
next up I really hope that Apple is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.560 
next up I really hope that Apple is
gonna<00:01:18.210> improve<00:01:18.630> Siri<00:01:19.170> yeah<00:01:20.040> why<00:01:20.759> Siri<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.360> ask

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
gonna improve Siri yeah why Siri you ask

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
gonna improve Siri yeah why Siri you ask
because<00:01:22.170> Siri<00:01:22.590> has<00:01:22.799> become<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> household<00:01:23.880> name

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
because Siri has become a household name

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420 
because Siri has become a household name
for<00:01:24.630> voice<00:01:24.960> recognition<00:01:25.159> even<00:01:26.159> though

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
for voice recognition even though

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910 
for voice recognition even though
Android<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.330> having<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.840> feature<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.259> long

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
Android was having this feature a long

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
Android was having this feature a long
time<00:01:29.369> before<00:01:29.579> iOS<00:01:29.939> yeah<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> need<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> give<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that watch it did not have the same

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
that watch it did not have the same
integration<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.950> Siri<00:01:35.280> gives<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
integration that Siri gives with the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.749 
integration that Siri gives with the
user<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> iphone<00:01:37.290> 4s<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.340> awesome

and is rock-solid if you ask me I really
hope<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.100> Apple<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.700> put<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
hope that Apple is gonna put it out of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.510 
hope that Apple is gonna put it out of
beta<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.750> hope<00:01:43.290> Apple<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.159> allow

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
beta I hope Apple is really gonna allow

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
beta I hope Apple is really gonna allow
more<00:01:44.820> services<00:01:45.390> around<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> globe<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.350> take

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
more services around the globe to take

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
more services around the globe to take
advantage<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> theory<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:48.090> languages<00:01:48.689> with

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
advantage of theory more languages with

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080 
advantage of theory more languages with
that<00:01:49.170> too<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.369> give<00:01:50.579> us<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.880> better

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that too and you know give us a better

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
that too and you know give us a better
experience<00:01:51.540> even<00:01:52.110> though<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:52.500> live<00:01:52.770> in

the<00:01:52.979> US<00:01:53.840> next<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.350> camera<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.979> don't<00:01:56.280> really

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the US next up the camera I don't really

think<00:01:56.460> Apple<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> improve<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
think Apple is going to improve the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 
think Apple is going to improve the
camera<00:01:58.200> why<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> iphone<00:01:59.280> 4<00:01:59.490> has

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
camera why because the iphone 4 has

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
camera why because the iphone 4 has
already<00:01:59.790> had<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> rock-solid<00:02:00.719> camera<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
already had a rock-solid camera of the

megapixels<00:02:18.409> only<00:02:18.769> become<00:02:19.269> important<00:02:20.269> in<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
megapixels only become important in the

megapixels only become important in the
story<00:02:20.870> when<00:02:21.349> an<00:02:21.469> image<00:02:21.859> is<00:02:22.069> as<00:02:22.340> big<00:02:22.790> as<00:02:23.030> van<00:02:23.689> or

something yeah otherwise it does not

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
matter how much megapixels you have I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.509 
matter how much megapixels you have I
expect<00:02:29.810> apple<00:02:30.109> to<00:02:30.140> use<00:02:30.379> LTE<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.280> next

generation iphone because it is the next
generation<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:34.400> connectivity<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.329> we<00:02:35.450> all

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
generation of connectivity that we all

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.330 
generation of connectivity that we all
are<00:02:35.840> getting<00:02:36.109> used<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.500> very<00:02:36.769> very<00:02:36.859> slowly

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
last up battery life I really hope that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.280 
last up battery life I really hope that
Apple's<00:02:40.639> got<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.909> improve<00:02:41.180> battery<00:02:41.720> life<00:02:41.959> on

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
Apple's got to improve battery life on

Apple's got to improve battery life on
the<00:02:42.409> iphone<00:02:42.799> battery<00:02:43.280> life<00:02:43.670> has<00:02:44.030> been<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.239> big

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the iphone battery life has been a big

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.509 
the iphone battery life has been a big
issue<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.439> last<00:02:45.650> years<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.010> development

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
issue on the last years of development

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.009 
issue on the last years of development
even<00:02:46.879> though<00:02:47.120> we're<00:02:47.269> getting<00:02:47.510> better<00:02:47.629> about

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
even though we're getting better about

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.750 
even though we're getting better about
designing<00:02:48.439> beautiful<00:02:48.859> products<00:02:49.549> with

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
fast we did not really take care of the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.710 
fast we did not really take care of the
battery<00:02:55.040> life<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.519> would<00:02:55.970> really<00:02:56.239> like<00:02:56.389> to<00:02:56.540> see

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
battery life I would really like to see

battery life I would really like to see
that<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:57.019> iphone<00:02:57.379> will<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.620> enough<00:02:57.919> juice

for me using it completely for at least
two<00:03:00.919> days<00:03:01.280> straight<00:03:01.909> would<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.049> meet<00:03:03.260> looking

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709
