00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.040
 hello to all youtube friends 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.630
 welcome to this new video in which 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.420
 We will be doing the unboxing of 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.430
 Esteve War is 5.7 that the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.980
 cv company through the website 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.080
 of ku curry aquarium addles dotcom 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.000
 so thank you so much to vicky for 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.439
 have lent us this device and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.300
 He also told us that as of today 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.670
 we will start uploading videos more often 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.970
 since we have been a month practically 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.590
 without uploading videos to this channel due to 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.840
 several personal issues but good 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.100
 let's hope that as I said as I said 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.750
 previously that as of today 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 we start uploading videos more often 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 then we go with the unboxing 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.670
 well then let's unpack this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 device then let's remove it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.060
 knowing the top cap to gestamp and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 with the first thing that we find is 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.250
 with the mobile device we're going to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.510
 take out and we'll leave it aside for 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.400
 analyze it below as you see is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.020
 a very large device 5 x 7 inches 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.880
 as I said earlier we are going to 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.740
 leave this side and let's see what else 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.369
 there is in the box if we remove this flap 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.650
 let's see we find a 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.440
 instruction manual 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.290
 but over here the usb to micro cable 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.460
 usb to load it and also with the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 terno to our computer 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.240
 you must have my usb entry with the work 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.240
 normal micro usb 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.640
 here we would have the charger 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.650
 also bq includes in this version these 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.420
 helmets that the truth is appreciated 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.100
 good as you see nothing else in the box 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.930
 so we 're going to withdraw it and we're going to 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.350
 go on to light what has been the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.490
 bq has a screen the truth that a 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.430
 first view on the screen is 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.630
 incredible a pretty showy size that 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.820
 it attracts a lot the final decisions 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.710
 down the street with this people are going to 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.630
 to look a little bit weird 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.500
 not then let's proceed to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.500
 Turn it on 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.490
 well it lights up you can see the logo of bq 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.160
 while I turn on I'm going to tell you some 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.440
 characteristics so good 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.280
 main features has a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.890
 full screen hd 1080 by 1920 ips a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.350
 quad-core processor running one with 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.300
 five cuts 7 also has two 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.910
 cities of ram a front camera of 5 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.830
 megapixels and a rear of 3 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.870
 megapixels as you can see here 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.010
 It also has 16 GB of memory 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.200
 Dual SIM and internal battery 4000 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.870
 milliamps as you see is a battery 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 very big since being 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.239
 a device that has a screen of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.349
 57 inches because it consumes enough 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.030
 battery and now what everyone will be 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.860
 wondering how much better after 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 this device this device has 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.920
 a current price of 260 euros very cheap 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.440
 for the features they offer and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.970
 also counting that it is a brand 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.519
 Spanish is worth all this device 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.810
 to come sent from somewhere in 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.730
 Spain 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.890
 Well, we unlocked it and as you can see 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.720
 let's see the version of Android 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.010
 bring this device so we're going 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.030
 for you it's phone information 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.360
 android printing as you see is the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:19.489
 version 4.2 4.2.1 and the ibi and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.560
 supposedly bq promises to update this 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.650
 device to future releases like 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.360
 can be kitkat and bring this application 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.040
 the web you I'll show now 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.040
 let's see if I find it 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.920
 It is this that you see up here that puts 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.080
 update with this application then 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.540
 when bq 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.630
 install some update no 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.030
 will reach the mobile via drips then the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.380
 we will install as commented 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.580
 previously an ips full hd screen 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.900
 1980 by 1920 quad-core processor to 7 and 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.640
 2 gigas of ram these would be the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.010
 main characteristics or the most 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.750
 highlighted and they also believe seal 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.850
 one thing that now then teach we are going to 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.350
 see let's uncover the device that 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.940
 is the piece of batteries that this 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.180
 device that the truth remains a 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.180
 little bit 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.280
 As you can see, what battery is it that occupies 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.900
 almost all the phone 4000 amps 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.410
 let's pay a little bit the device 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.810
 why 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.360
 to get to teach you the best the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.979
 we pay 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.370
 and we are going to extract what has been the 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.370
 drums 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.740
 look at what piece of battery or here 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.320
 you see the screen I do not have on the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.850
 battery and as you can see is part of the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.760
 phone and also if you take away the 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.320
 battery to the phone does not weigh does not weigh almost 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.870
 nothing because you also have to comment that 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.700
 the phone weighs 200 grams 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.920
 for a person who has not had a 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.020
 phone so a little modern you do not notice 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.920
 but for a person for example comes 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.870
 of a galaxy s3 or a galaxy gio that yes 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.090
 not two to a device so from 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.710
 truth that weighs a little bit better without 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.510
 nothing more to say thank you for having 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.500
 seen this video remember that if it has 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.690
