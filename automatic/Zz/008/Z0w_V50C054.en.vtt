00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 mario that's the one with the mud and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 kingdom princess peach codes and coopers 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.969
 just the area browser is fighting that 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 is not he the mario of which he speaks or 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.240
 wrong before I finish 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 went camping on the console 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 it for me on the gameboy going on 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.730
 just with the marie hotel of the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.539
 until then established game world on the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 has made head 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.119
 Here is our nostalgic too great 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.119
 mario land 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.340
 that seems almost at nintendo 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
 mesh to be the gameboy parts 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.100
 known franchises it in other worlds 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 to move 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 you look only to zelda and left 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.180
 waiting for super mario 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.370
 because yokoi is the inventor of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 gameboys unfortunately already in 1997 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.760
 died 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 that was also the first mario 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.730
 Do not play at the shigeru miyamoto 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.320
 was involved 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.109
 I felt the game compared to super 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.329
 mario world mario 64 and yes, yes 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.100
 always a bit strange but only at 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.199
 the research for him this two more 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 opponent here is the story of super 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.320
 mario land noticed 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.760
 the thing is playing in sarah 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 Saarland 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.189
 he has nothing to do with it that exists 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.439
 from the kingdom beer abo or branches 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.100
 and shouted the four level zones 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.869
 represent 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.869
 This world is threatened by the evil aliens 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 katanga that hypnotized all inhabitants 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.439
 so did princess daisy dee that fell 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 then immediately kidnapped and married 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.680
 want 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.500
 ok that I can hear everything for the first 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.939
 times and you probably also so far 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.560
 I just accepted the whole thing 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.549
 play was a nasty fever dream of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380
 been mario 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.540
 how is he coming to sarah? 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.790
 saarland and where does that exist? 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 it also play in other mario and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.689
 but why he saves it recognizes de 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 not at all or you just have it 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.680
 In princesses rescue complex no matter 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.680
 Let's just ignore the story 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.350
 for me , the four worlds shoot 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.600
 just the egypt the sea 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.490
 easter islands and china so you see 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.929
 namely, all playful is yes 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.700
 everything is known from left to right 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.399
 run on opponent pounding coins 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.379
 Collect finished in super mario land there 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.640
 It's exactly a power up, namely the flower 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.310
 the delete us firefighter 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.450
 no moment at this point 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.980
 I'm in the research about that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.330
 second detail bumped that mine 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.799
 childhood memories of super mario 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.930
 land over the pile raises 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.610
 these are not fireflies mario 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.200
 shoots no fireballs because of 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.129
 the pixel graphics just the black one 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.720
 balls look like 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.380
 this transformation is actually called 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.269
 superball mario and shoots 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.340
 Well , we make a great wave 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.959
 Memories completely distort this 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.110
 kumba-like creatures are not there 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.060
 Cuba's are just the Cuba's 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.579
 actually noko bonds and the ball 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.230
 willys hot pa now I am 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.700
 convinced that super mario land 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.040
 just in a parallel universe 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.390
 It can not be a dream 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.829
 Finally , daisy dives in too 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.180
 others play and I try 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.370
 just serious the continuity of 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.470
 Mario play explain ok stops here 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.540
 it's all about nostalgia and that brings 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.459
 super mario lent in good spirits 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.410
 mood prepares him alone puts me 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.510
 back in the 90s when I was with the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.950
 klo bread box gameboy on the playground 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.950
 my elementary school was on the way 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.050
 At that time I was super mario and much too 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.060
 hard why I never do it as a kid 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.530
 really have played through at the latest 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.040
 In the china world, it always has me 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.960
 Caught 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.520
 Today I almost need speed 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.410
 level through the levels and create 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.390
 a passage in just under 20 minutes 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.980
 if you then directly another 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.540
 Incidentally, the opponents will start to run 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.140
 numerous and the game clearly 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.940
 severe 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.230
 but also this mode western scarce 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.660
 master half an hour 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.850
 So there really is not much in the game 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.650
 super mario land but I do not care 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.630
 because with its about 18 million 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.150
 Super mario land has the sales 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.209
 for the still lively second part 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.709
 finished super mario land 2b golden coins 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.720
 deviates at least as much from 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.580
 Mario Karner off like the first part 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.670
 But that may be a topic for 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.830
 another consequence of nostalgic that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.510
 wars with mouse pointer to super mario land 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.799
 on the gameboy maybe it works 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.410
 Sometime here with great times 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.940
 a two golden coins if you are now 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.620
 already in retro mood side anyway 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.180
 I recommend you our nostalgic 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.570
 playlist because you give games like 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.060
 churchill partly to pokÃ©mon half life 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.800
 and play anything retro if possible 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.270
 you'd rather like trivia and fun facts 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.310
 I recommend you my video too 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.740
 bioshock the distinctive among others that 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.220
 little sisters in the conception mice 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.620
 were 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.620
 have fun and see you next time 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.120
 Maybe we'll be here for supermodel 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:04.800
 Started 12 coins as the facts that 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.800
 linz is that mice were
