00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
what I did and I I guess that was a key

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
what I did and I I guess that was a key
of<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.649> Victor<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:38.969> obviously

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of with Victor now was it obviously

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
of with Victor now was it obviously
difficult<00:00:39.510> start<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.050> four<00:00:40.350> games<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> then

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
difficult start with four games and then

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
difficult start with four games and then
the<00:00:41.309> rain<00:00:41.489> delay<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.420> seem<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:45.020> Randall
