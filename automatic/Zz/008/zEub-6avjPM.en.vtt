world would he need well not really need
with<00:00:41.010> shock<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.370> why<00:00:41.520> would<00:00:41.700> he<00:00:41.730> switch<00:00:42.510> I'll

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
with shock but why would he switch I'll

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.069 
with shock but why would he switch I'll
to<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.610> overheat<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.789> gonna<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to it and overheat is gonna really do a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
to it and overheat is gonna really do a
massive<00:00:46.500> amount<00:00:46.739> go<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.550> his<00:00:47.789> 30<00:00:48.090> can

not a problem i mean Charizard he's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.270 
not a problem i mean Charizard he's
probably<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.260> his<00:00:58.289> car<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.890> he<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.190> have

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
probably in his car so he would have

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670 
probably in his car so he would have
easily<00:00:59.609> took<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.420> char<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.930> did<00:01:01.530> not

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
easily took down my char that did not

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
easily took down my char that did not
make<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> switch<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:02.940> switch<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.780> gradually

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
make the switch but switch out gradually

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649 
make the switch but switch out gradually
switch<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.070> he<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> skunk<00:01:06.090> tank<00:01:06.299> again

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
he didn't really do any damage to me so

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.000 
he didn't really do any damage to me so
I<00:03:33.120> do<00:03:33.180> take<00:03:33.510> him<00:03:33.629> down<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:34.200> grade<00:03:34.470> is

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
I do take him down that this grade is

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.589 
I do take him down that this grade is
going<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.310> go<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:35.579> rapid<00:03:35.849> spin<00:03:36.030> taking<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
going to go for rapid spin taking the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.039 
going to go for rapid spin taking the
opportunity<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:37.260> get<00:03:38.010> rid<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.549> rocks<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
opportunity to get rid of the rocks the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.479 
opportunity to get rid of the rocks the
problem<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.470> could<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.769> stood<00:03:40.889> out<00:03:41.069> hunter

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
problem I could have stood out hunter

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.920 
problem I could have stood out hunter
but<00:03:41.669> then<00:03:41.790> again<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:42.030> cannot<00:03:42.269> really<00:03:42.480> want<00:03:42.720> shot

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
but then again I cannot really want shot

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.800 
but then again I cannot really want shot
it<00:03:43.079> afterwards<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.280> he's<00:03:44.639> probably<00:03:45.239> gonna<00:03:45.629> be

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
it afterwards so he's probably gonna be

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.809 
it afterwards so he's probably gonna be
having<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.169> opportunity<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.709> take<00:03:46.919> me<00:03:47.069> out<00:03:47.099> so

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
having the opportunity to take me out so

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.949 
having the opportunity to take me out so
that's<00:03:47.940> something<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.269> didn't<00:03:48.510> really<00:03:48.629> want<00:03:48.900> to

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
that's something I didn't really want to

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.780 
that's something I didn't really want to
risk<00:03:49.230> plus<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:49.980> know<00:03:50.040> he's<00:03:50.250> probably<00:03:50.400> gonna<00:03:50.669> go

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
risk plus I know he's probably gonna go

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.189 
risk plus I know he's probably gonna go
for<00:03:51.000> red<00:03:51.120> spin<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.569> then<00:03:51.599> go<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:51.959> meat

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
for red spin and then go for the meat

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.099 
for red spin and then go for the meat
the<00:03:52.590> meat<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:53.010> match<00:03:53.940> stealth<00:03:54.629> rocks<00:03:54.870> which

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
the meat on match stealth rocks which

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.259 
the meat on match stealth rocks which
again<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.590> not<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> problem<00:03:56.430> as<00:03:56.609> mighty<00:03:56.819> isn't

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
again is not a problem as mighty isn't

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.420 
again is not a problem as mighty isn't
putting<00:03:57.389> bleep<00:03:57.660> drugs<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.769> begin<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.220> and

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
was so blown away by it

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.260 
was so blown away by it
but<00:06:40.410> it's<00:06:40.890> one<00:06:41.220> of<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.430> easiest<00:06:41.460> Pokemon<00:06:42.150> to

but it's one of the easiest Pokemon to

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.180 
but it's one of the easiest Pokemon to
