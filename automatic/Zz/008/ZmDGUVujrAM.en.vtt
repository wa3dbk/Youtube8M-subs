00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.080 
to go in tools and make sure your
picture<00:01:08.689> duration<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.649> taught<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.580> like<00:01:10.790> and

picture duration is taught you like and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.139 
picture duration is taught you like and
it's<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.750> advanced<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.789> can<00:01:13.970> have<00:01:14.119> that

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's in advanced so you can have that

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.170 
it's in advanced so you can have that
higher<00:01:14.539> or<00:01:14.570> lower<00:01:14.869> I<00:01:15.350> usually<00:01:15.680> have<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.070> at<00:01:16.190> 125

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
higher or lower I usually have it at 125

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.510 
higher or lower I usually have it at 125
because<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:17.659> easier<00:01:17.930> also<00:01:18.770> make<00:01:18.920> sure<00:01:18.950> your

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
because it's easier also make sure your

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.249 
because it's easier also make sure your
video<00:01:19.789> formats<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.630> ones<00:01:20.810> on<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.020> screen

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
video formats on the ones on the screen

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.990 
but I'm going to be using 4 by 3 as my
pictures<00:01:24.380> are<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.590> four<00:01:24.770> by<00:01:24.920> three<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.789> four

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
videos there as you can see you can

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.680 
videos there as you can see you can
scroll<00:01:57.319> across<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.979> check<00:01:58.700> all<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.880> them<00:02:01.690> I'll

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
scroll across and check all of them I'll

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.109 
scroll across and check all of them I'll
just<00:02:03.020> play<00:02:03.259> up<00:02:03.379> to<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.340> should<00:02:04.610> look<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.910> bit

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
just play up to you it should look a bit

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:14.170 
just play up to you it should look a bit
like<00:02:05.149> this<00:02:05.509> at<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.929> moment

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.830 

as<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.079> can<00:02:15.200> see<00:02:15.409> it<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:16.129> looks<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.489> the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
as you can see it it looks like the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.610 
as you can see it it looks like the
people<00:02:17.840> are<00:02:17.930> actually<00:02:18.019> walking<00:02:18.319> now<00:02:18.739> and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
people are actually walking now and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.330 
people are actually walking now and
because<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.549> framerate<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:24.530> about<00:02:24.620> 15

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
because the framerate is that's about 15

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.300 
because the framerate is that's about 15
frames<00:02:25.579> per<00:02:25.730> second<00:02:26.269> which<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.079> a<00:02:27.109> really<00:02:28.099> good

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
frames per second which is a really good

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.539 
frames per second which is a really good
frame<00:02:28.819> rate<00:02:29.060> especially<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.260> you're<00:02:30.549> using

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
frame rate especially if you're using

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.339 
frame rate especially if you're using
like<00:02:31.879> taking<00:02:32.389> pictures<00:02:32.569> for<00:02:32.750> every<00:02:33.109> slight

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
like taking pictures for every slight

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.390 
like taking pictures for every slight
movement<00:02:34.870> okay<00:02:35.870> or<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.799> go<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.189> a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
movement okay or you can go on a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.860 
movement okay or you can go on a
storyboard<00:02:37.790> where<00:02:38.299> you<00:02:38.359> can<00:02:38.480> see<00:02:38.629> all<00:02:38.659> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
storyboard where you can see all the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.750 
storyboard where you can see all the
pictures<00:02:39.129> this<00:02:40.129> is<00:02:40.310> where<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.549> can<00:02:40.639> add

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
pictures this is where you can add

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.929 
pictures this is where you can add
effects<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.599> different<00:02:42.079> transitions<00:02:42.769> it's<00:02:43.730> a

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
effects and different transitions it's a

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:52.179 
effects and different transitions it's a
really<00:02:44.120> useful<00:02:44.349> object<00:02:49.720> okay<00:02:50.739> between<00:02:51.739> those

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
really useful object okay between those

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.190 
really useful object okay between those
2<00:02:52.489> i'm<00:02:52.609> going<00:02:52.639> to<00:02:52.849> add<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> transition<00:02:53.329> because

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
2 i'm going to add a transition because

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.069 
2 i'm going to add a transition because
it<00:02:54.530> looks<00:02:54.799> nice<00:02:55.239> rather<00:02:56.239> than<00:02:56.359> just<00:02:56.569> suddenly

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
it looks nice rather than just suddenly

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.819 
it looks nice rather than just suddenly
cutting<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.799> each<00:02:57.919> scene<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.549> good<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.939> like

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
cutting to each scene it's good to like

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.699 
cutting to each scene it's good to like
below<00:03:00.829> them<00:03:01.069> two<00:03:01.280> together<00:03:02.409> otherwise<00:03:03.409> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
below them two together otherwise the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
doesn't really have time to them like

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.729 
doesn't really have time to them like
taking<00:03:09.169> the<00:03:09.260> information<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:10.159> seen<00:03:11.739> so

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
taking the information it's just seen so

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.149 
taking the information it's just seen so
you<00:03:12.799> want<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.040> go<00:03:13.129> back<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.459> timeline<00:03:14.000> and

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
you want to go back on timeline and

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.430 
you want to go back on timeline and
that's<00:03:16.159> not<00:03:16.489> going<00:03:16.639> to<00:03:16.730> last<00:03:16.819> very<00:03:17.060> long<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:18.260> we

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
that's not going to last very long so we

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.979 
that's not going to last very long so we
want<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.739> make<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:19.159> a<00:03:19.250> lot<00:03:19.400> bigger<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
want to make it a lot bigger the

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.170 
want to make it a lot bigger the
transition<00:03:21.620> because<00:03:22.370> it's<00:03:22.699> going<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:22.940> last

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
transition because it's going to last

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.920 
transition because it's going to last
like<00:03:23.449> half<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.079> second<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:26.060> there<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:26.780> you're

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
like half a second so there now you're

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.349 
like half a second so there now you're
going<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.109> have<00:03:27.199> to<00:03:27.319> drag<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.739> in<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:29.150> you

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
going to have to drag it in like you

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.420 
going to have to drag it in like you
would<00:03:29.540> normally<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.319> that<00:03:30.620> transition<00:03:31.340> is

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
would normally but that transition is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.199 
would normally but that transition is
going<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.669> stay<00:03:31.879> there<00:03:32.979> right<00:03:33.979> now<00:03:34.909> I'm<00:03:35.060> going

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
going to stay there right now I'm going

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.020 
going to stay there right now I'm going
to<00:03:35.269> show<00:03:35.419> you<00:03:35.479> what<00:03:35.689> it<00:03:35.810> now<00:03:35.989> looks<00:03:36.260> like<00:03:37.030> once

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
to show you what it now looks like once

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:52.280 
to show you what it now looks like once
it's<00:03:38.329> all<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:43.489> transition

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.729 

as<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.069> can<00:03:53.189> see<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.700> nicely<00:03:54.390> runs<00:03:55.290> into<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
as you can see it nicely runs into the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.330 
as you can see it nicely runs into the
two<00:03:56.250> seams<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.319> it's<00:03:58.319> not<00:03:58.560> suddenly<00:03:58.890> cutting

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
two seams and it's not suddenly cutting

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.380 
two seams and it's not suddenly cutting
across<00:03:59.609> which<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.209> good<00:04:00.420> thing<00:04:04.730> now<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.790> you
