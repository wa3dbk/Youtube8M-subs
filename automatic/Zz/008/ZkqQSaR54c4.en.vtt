00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.920
 the wetland is not 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.339
 It's good, the forrÃ³ the natal pacaembu. 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:23.770
 the car pam is not good now let's see 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.550
 the circus the tail circuit with 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.410
 helicopter 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.050
 I'll start teaching the circuit. 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.700
 simple tail and then we pass 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.610
 something more advanced this people 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 loop circuit at zero in 8 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 here we go 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.690
 I'll make a tail siege forever 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 I came here for you to see 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.340
 just for me 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.340
 do it very slowly 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.410
 OK 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.960
 so now let's see in some steps 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.630
 how to take course 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.610
 the first thing is you'll get 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.830
 speed but it will not be when 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 and how it will turn white because it is 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.480
 Boy, what are you doing? 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.840
 helicopter and the collective so that he 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.760
 it 's not Tuesday 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.120
 then you will sting the helicopter will 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.210
 to rise a little to appear the tail is 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.140
 180 degrees helicopter again and then 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.600
 Are you coming back now? 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 remembering that when you are 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.820
 doing in this part of the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.940
 without being the part of the curve in the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.620
 start and pass straight so you have to 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.460
 make corrections in europe that he 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.460
 keep oo 1 of the circuit 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.409
 let's go again 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.730
 and with helicopter turns every pica again 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:29.200
 pican gira is once again a little and here 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 with them doing know maieron good 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.900
 this is the simple circuit of calm 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.290
 is 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.790
 Okay, now go circuit zero 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.790
 cause and I'll do it for you 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.330
 Hmm 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.240
 Okay, now I'll show you the steps for you. 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.700
 do circus 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.250
 the first thing as in the circuit 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 simple you go cabral helicopter 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.060
 give some corrective 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.280
 now to make the curve with a helicopter 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.960
 Is to put another going back and is not 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.700
 so complicated is the same principle 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.230
 there is agreement forward 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.830
 so I 'll show you here you have to 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.170
 do 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.330
 the meeting was the speed of 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.820
 colombia already eron to the side that I know 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.550
 that the guilty party is guilty then 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.020
 I already commanded here. 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.270
 How he runs stadium, little boy, he's going to 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.160
 to the left but I want to do as 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:53.190
 then it's okay if I 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.550
 know as jairon see as helicopter 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.320
 as well as a normal curve it 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.150
 tend to india go now 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.320
 So, how do I fix it? 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.760
 This I'm going to use cause so he 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:14.370
 always keep the same is the same course 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.900
 so let's go there as the geron uses the tail 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.280
 and the collective that he does not want 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.049
 now as you can see just as the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.640
 Normal circuit is basically the same 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.610
 circuit but the difference is that 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.640
 You're leaving, it's all behind you. 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.169
 commands are some are necessarily the 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.169
 same but it's the same principle 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.780
 Now let's go back to the congener on the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.340
 tail and you will have to also get a 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.050
 little helicopter so he can not 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.230
 has that tendency to descend then 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.110
 Are you going to give collective helicopter stand? 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.470
 as the geron and adjusting one of the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.460
 helicopter with tail 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:03.710
 You'll have to also do some 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:06.480
 light colleagues corrections in aileron ok 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.750
 so this is how you make a curve 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.600
 where the prize goes 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:19.880
 now as circuit come on you 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.880
 will make the curve align the helicopter 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.890
 and another thing 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.230
 beauty does not have not got 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.650
 The secret beyond what I have is why 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.870
 basically you know how to do the curve of 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.640
 The tail you will have to train is 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.130
 You'll be able to make the circuit with 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.810
 facility 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.650
 now let's see the circus because 8 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.470
 which is good looking too but I'm not going 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:57.350
 making format 18 is the same as a 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.350
 circuit in 8 is putting forward 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.350
 ok now as well as the new circuit in 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:25.190
 8 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:28.250
 It's normal, it 's normal what I say with him. 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:32.000
 with the practice ahead you will have to 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.860
 and learning to make a turn in 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.590
 out or buy rights from 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:44.660
 children because here in the case 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.340
 I make the curve and when I look at 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.170
 I want to go home 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:53.570
 For me I 'll have to reverse the 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:56.990
 direction on the other side of the curve 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.250
 is exactly the same as the curve 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.190
 to this side 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.160
 What will change is only the direction of the 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.660
 the steering control and the steering 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:13.070
 Overall only this 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:15.110
 The rest is the same, okay, so it's not 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.200
 I have no further indication to give 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:24.050
 respect of tail circus is basically 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:26.780
 same as the circuit is forward but 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.610
 being that they go back is not 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.630
 basically the same thing the curves are 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.580
 the same principle also and only change the 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.960
 commands 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.960
 so it's until next time
