00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.550
 if there is a French car that 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.140
 arouses desire and curiosity in 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.700
 moment it is the future alpine but 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.160
 this one will be marketed only at the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.330
 end of 2016 meanwhile it is however 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.130
 possible to already take the wheel 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.170
 in the game gran turismo 6 for which 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.460
 the brand has created a car that we 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:37.540
 you present today at the scale 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:39.040
 We have a car that is called 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.750
 to ride in the streets of paris 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.269
 but go close because they wear 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.210
 all the genes and I would say even 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.540
 alpine history since the first 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.500
 alpine even to the future car that 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.809
 went out in 2016 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.420
 you have the winks and this 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.019
 car in the game was in focus 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.449
 by our engineers who are in the process of 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.210
 work on the ground link of the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.960
 berlinette and if you go play 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.080
 gran turismo you will see that the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.150
 alpine signature that is this agility 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 in the turns flight was going to find her 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.619
 and it's a kazunori signature me 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.329
 said last night that she's pretty 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.350
 unique in all cars and 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.229
 as much as they have a lot in their 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.750
 garage of all the game in tourism in 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.829
 the brief we gave to the designers in 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.969
 did it was to have a back 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.729
 spectacular why because the 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.380
 player makes a special blunder it's 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.420
 the back view so what we said is 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.039
 we wanted a really unique view 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.750
 spectacular so in fact we have these 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.450
 graphic lines that come open 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.429
 the back to finally leave 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.799
 to appear the technique the beautiful ones 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.689
 parts the trains and since we see 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.340
 also we have long wings 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.460
 backs that are actually a wink 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.310
 to the admins of mans the 60s the 220 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.020
 the 210 the cockpit right in 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.670
 it's a typology of trays 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.710
 guy the mans so why because 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.229
 that today our news is the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.140
 endurance race with the 450 we have been 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.700
 double European champion 2013 2014 and we 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.740
 wanted to bring this same experience 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.910
 in the game gran turismo what is 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.140
 interesting too I was talking about everything to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.310
 the time of the rear view the second 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.990
 goal that is privileged in the game 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.680
 obviously it's at the wheel 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.310
 so we really wanted something 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.360
 of identity something very 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.739
 modern we have a view that is very 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.750
 spectacular we see the wings to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.960
 the front we see the small bosses on 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.610
 sees the additional headlights 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.110
 so again what we want is 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.520
 they have a unique view really 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.160
 thinks we're sitting in we're 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.440
 in an alpine then obviously the front 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.840
 we really came to take inspiration from the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.080
 berlinette a110 with projectors 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 additional with the v shape we had 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.040
 the ribs that existed on the on the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.810
 sedan is there we came from a train 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.060
 to interpret graphically but that's 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.310
 true we really have here rather used 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.380
 the inspiration at 110 and that gives him a 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.300
 identity that is truly unique that 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.490
 recognize not given back among all and 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.200
 among all the vehicles and we at 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.700
 caradisiac we're lucky because 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.790
 we will be driving the alpine before 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.790
 world
