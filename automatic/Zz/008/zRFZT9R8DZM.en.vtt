00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.650
 good morning business stÃ©phane soumier 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.359
 on bfm business 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 so it's jean brice dumont who is 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.870
 with our technical director 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.429
 eurocopter hello jean brice of the world 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.570
 we can not thank you very much to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.250
 letters with our daughter marseille 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.809
 did not want to face the strikes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.320
 air traffic controllers 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.880
 and I do not want you at all 472 km 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 time I have a very very simple question 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.670
 jean-brice from we see him one acf so 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.090
 you can watch us at the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.310
 television 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 we see it your x3 is that it's 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 another jean-brice helicopter from mans 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.859
 yeah it's a helicopter because 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 uses all means of propulsion 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 classic helicopter we just 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 derivatives of what is called the box 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.960
 transmission that puts the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.820
 motor power to the rotor we have 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.180
 derived from power to propellers 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 lateral which ensures the function that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.700
 allows developers not to 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.559
 turn on itself the function 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.660
 classically insured at the back by a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 rear rotor and a function of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.289
 additional propulsion level we go 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.370
 be clear what she is trying then from this 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.590
 that we call I believe in the field 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.730
 Turboprop air normally 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.340
 these are the elements that equip the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.290
 planes and that 's what allows this 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.090
 helicopter bottom is to go too 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.830
 fast that makes it the turboprop 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 in an airplane it's the engine that 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.970
 sting y that drives the lilies there one 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.010
 does not use more than the engines 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.229
 conventional helicopter which are 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 located in the same place and we use 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.340
 records that in English we call clean 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.590
 and their ire soon even from the point of view 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 language but we do not use 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.229
 additional propulsion agree and the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.909
 lily above it is what it serves 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.790
 still at something finally when 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.130
 we're going at that speed, well, yes 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.420
 she still do to ensure lift 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 of the helicopter the circle only makes 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 the helicopter holds in the air that is 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 shared with small towns that are 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.490
 facts the end of which are are 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.320
 hung the additional clues but 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.909
 the postponement to go faster and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.590
 slows down so lille ensures a lot 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.360
 less its function than on a helicopter 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.250
 conventional is because at one point 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.509
 that's it anyway that limits the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.790
 helicopter speed that's the idea 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.829
 yes indeed their wrong 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.649
 the rotor rotating at a speed already 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.120
 quite high the tip of the blades that advance 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.740
 see a speed 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.860
 a sees happen a traditional vita 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.860
 from the front and pale Buddha passes the wall 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.470
 sound and faf and it's impossible or 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.830
 the straw that passes the wall of the cent 472 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.720
 kilometer 487 km hour even downhill 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.550
 yes clung the crypt and jean globe 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.050
 in terms of materials finally does it 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.210
 there are also elements on which 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.210
 you had to innovate for for 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.430
 build this wonderful object we 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.530
 did not really have to finally have the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.230
 beauty of our two countries cooperate 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.580
 it's a concept that concept 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.150
 of giro dean which is a concept already 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.830
 existing 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.530
 did we do if we did 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.460
 does a great puzzle game with 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.980
 a lot of parts of our leagues 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.300
 helicopters from our range the only one 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.770
 only area in which we had to go 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.830
 which was unusual for us that's the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.840
 field of propellers and so that's us 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.400
 are close to aircraft manufacturer for for 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.900
 to be more familiar with the field of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.120
 propellers of horizontal propulsion one 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.900
 will say for all the rest it's a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.340
 well found assembly two parts 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.750
 helicopters of our range good so 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.040
 we understand the usefulness of such 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.320
 exploit that is to say that you want 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.989
 demonstrate that we can combine a speed 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.860
 which becomes a speed then 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.820
 competitive even what is the planes 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.050
 fly about twice as fast 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.540
 that here and there we are obviously on 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.130
 records but with a vertical takeoff 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.330
 because it's obviously the big thing 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.100
 strength of the helicopter today 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.380
 ability to land anywhere and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.450
 take off from exactly where done 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 it's to find a hybrid solution 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.840
 between the plane that goes that can 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.070
 actually for airliners 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.050
 had twice as fast and 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.090
 the helicopter that could go from a villa 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.489
 a city but with a handicap of 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.560
 the scale he has customers today 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.060
 this helicopter not yet it's a 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.590
 show of strength of the recruiters 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.630
 exactly it's more of a demonstration 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.610
 we can tell you that there is 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.900
 many interested customers and 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.660
 many customers that the concept has 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.920
 excited but from there to say gets involved 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.510
 with customers would be a little 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.890
 fast internally in the heart of 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.500
 the company I imagine that to a record 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.420
 like that it has to mean something 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.769
 it's a big source of pride 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.920
 motivation for us for our teams 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.450
 the audi the image of the test pilot who 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.709
 fate himself and who has 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.200
 aware of having achieved an exploit 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.850
 rare is no doubt about it 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.560
 thank you red thank you very much jean-brice 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.760
 dumont thank you very much for these 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.890
 some elements so director 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.359
 technique of copying earth since since 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.459
 marseille you are in marseille 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.920
 the study has hammered since marignane the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.030
 eurocopter bases it will be 7:30 in a 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.030
 big minute it's bfm business
