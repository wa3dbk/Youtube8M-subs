eight<00:02:32.420> or<00:02:32.450> nine<00:02:32.780> dollars<00:02:32.990> each<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.580> clamp

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
eight or nine dollars each and I clamp

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.830 
eight or nine dollars each and I clamp
it<00:02:35.210> on<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> regular<00:02:36.250> microphone<00:02:37.250> stand<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.750> I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
it on a regular microphone stand so I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.040 
it on a regular microphone stand so I
had<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.440> spare<00:02:39.970> microphone<00:02:40.970> stands<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:41.720> using

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
had to spare microphone stands I'm using

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.830 
had to spare microphone stands I'm using
one<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.650> each<00:02:42.830> side<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.340> room<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
one on each side of the room and the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.750 
one on each side of the room and the
lamp<00:02:45.110> started<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.680> mean<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.950> bowls<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.520> use

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
lamp started I mean the bowls that I use

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.150 
lamp started I mean the bowls that I use
is<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.920> 40<00:02:48.920> watt<00:02:49.450> bulb

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
is a 40 watt bulb

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.060 
is a 40 watt bulb
450<00:02:52.160> lumens<00:02:54.460> okay<00:02:55.460> now<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.410> cover<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.710> clamp

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
450 lumens okay now I cover the clamp

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.110 
450 lumens okay now I cover the clamp
lights<00:02:58.400> with<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.480> wax<00:02:59.900> paper<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:04.310> softens<00:03:04.970> a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
lights with a wax paper so it softens a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.320 
lights with a wax paper so it softens a
little<00:03:05.390> bit<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:06.730> delight<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.940> think<00:03:11.180> it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
little bit to delight and I think it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.480 
little bit to delight and I think it
helps<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.720> kind<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.200> diffuse<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.860> little<00:03:13.310> bit

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
helps to kind of diffuse a little bit

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.370 
helps to kind of diffuse a little bit
the<00:03:13.640> light<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:14.060> mean<00:03:14.300> I'm<00:03:14.450> not<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.170> know<00:03:15.260> an

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
the light I mean I'm not you know an

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.590 
the light I mean I'm not you know an
expert<00:03:16.990> lighting<00:03:17.990> but<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:19.730> does<00:03:19.970> help<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.390> lot

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
expert lighting but it does help a lot

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.330 
expert lighting but it does help a lot
so<00:03:21.700> that's<00:03:22.700> basically<00:03:23.210> what<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.990> is<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
so that's basically what it is and the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.400 
so that's basically what it is and the
one<00:03:25.550> above<00:03:26.000> my<00:03:26.240> head<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:27.020> I<00:03:27.050> showed<00:03:27.380> you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
one above my head that I showed you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.340 
one above my head that I showed you
exactly<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.190> same<00:03:28.330> it's<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.480> one<00:03:29.810> two<00:03:30.140> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
exactly the same it's the one two and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.080 
exactly the same it's the one two and
three<00:03:30.620> that's<00:03:30.920> all<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.370> need<00:03:31.580> as<00:03:31.730> far<00:03:32.060> as

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
three that's all you need as far as

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.840 
three that's all you need as far as
positioning<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:33.020> lights<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.830> have<00:03:34.490> them<00:03:34.730> at

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
positioning the lights I have them at

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.670 
positioning the lights I have them at
about<00:03:35.120> 45<00:03:35.840> degree<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.610> they<00:03:37.790> are

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
about 45 degree and they are

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.220 
about 45 degree and they are
approximately<00:03:39.680> five<00:03:40.310> or<00:03:40.480> six<00:03:41.480> feet<00:03:41.780> away<00:03:42.020> from

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
approximately five or six feet away from

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.550 
approximately five or six feet away from
me<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.520> 45<00:03:44.270> degree<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:44.960> the<00:03:45.080> one<00:03:45.290> on<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
me so 45 degree and the one on the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.440 
me so 45 degree and the one on the
ceiling<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:47.450> about<00:03:47.780> one<00:03:48.530> foot<00:03:49.030> behind<00:03:50.030> my

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
ceiling it's about one foot behind my

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.470 
ceiling it's about one foot behind my
back<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.080> hanging<00:03:52.010> in<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> ceiling<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:52.880> you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
back and hanging in the ceiling so you

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.650 
back and hanging in the ceiling so you
have<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.110> play<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.350> rally<00:03:54.650> depends<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.550> how<00:03:56.360> big

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
have to play a rally depends on how big

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.020 
have to play a rally depends on how big
your<00:03:56.900> room<00:03:57.170> is<00:03:57.410> this<00:03:57.830> is<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.040> fairly<00:03:58.340> small<00:03:58.490> room

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
your room is this is a fairly small room

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.290 
your room is this is a fairly small room
so<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.810> can't<00:04:00.310> get<00:04:01.310> too<00:04:01.550> far<00:04:01.780> from<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.960> curtain

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
so I can't get too far from the curtain

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.910 
so I can't get too far from the curtain
now<00:04:05.300> when<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:05.660> recording<00:04:05.920> acoustically

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
now when I'm recording acoustically

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.020 
now when I'm recording acoustically

these<00:04:37.100> two<00:04:37.340> microphones<00:04:37.970> they<00:04:38.600> are<00:04:38.660> very

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
these two microphones they are very

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.469 
these two microphones they are very
inexpensive

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
inexpensive

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.249 
inexpensive
and<00:04:40.569> they<00:04:41.469> do<00:04:41.529> the<00:04:41.979> job<00:04:42.009> very<00:04:42.669> very<00:04:42.999> well

these<00:04:44.620> are<00:04:44.830> behringer's<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:46.210> motto<00:04:46.449> is<00:04:46.689> c2

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
these are behringer's the motto is c2

these are behringer's the motto is c2
and<00:04:48.659> i<00:04:49.659> think<00:04:49.960> they<00:04:50.080> cost<00:04:50.319> around<00:04:51.180> fifty<00:04:52.180> five

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
and i think they cost around fifty five

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.489 
and i think they cost around fifty five
to<00:04:52.479> sixty<00:04:52.990> dollars<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.039> pair<00:04:54.370> it's<00:04:54.909> a<00:04:55.499> very

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
to sixty dollars the pair it's a very

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.579 
to sixty dollars the pair it's a very
inexpensive<00:04:56.770> I've<00:04:57.490> done<00:04:57.879> some<00:04:58.210> blind<00:04:59.050> tests

00:04:59.579 --> 00:04:59.589 
inexpensive I've done some blind tests

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:02.279 
inexpensive I've done some blind tests
with<00:04:59.889> them<00:05:00.129> and<00:05:00.550> it's<00:05:01.150> amazing<00:05:01.419> they<00:05:01.870> they

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
with them and it's amazing they they

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.290 
with them and it's amazing they they
really<00:05:02.620> do<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.919> trick<00:05:03.189> so<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:05.800> want<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.129> make
