00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.810
 this autumn tell exciting game 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.670
 germany against argentina in wm 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.900
 finale who would have thought it 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.710
 Germany is in the big final with 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.710
 argentina with 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.050
 air 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.510
 greenpeace sees the lineup 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 I think the choice 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.020
 now time 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.490
 courses would be there on the miller 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.500
 right side with left 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.190
 So worked 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.160
 that is the question will be the maria 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.940
 play or tip it is natural 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.330
 from dr 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.540
 this will be a very exciting game 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.930
 to have 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.930
 that these even 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.799
 the pine trees and a team here with the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.799
 first chance 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.220
 the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.000
 minute 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.510
 this winless 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.120
 Building something is unattainable for june 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.130
 This also destroys the chance 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.960
 that brings a few minutes further 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.210
 and see a nice that people here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.150
 the on course who is not right there 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.960
 must enforce that brings 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.960
 flames over 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 dollar 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.290
 No 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:57.830
 and at 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:02:02.300
 Turned on tour now gets warded 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.460
 then worth 30 minutes of ideal value 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.460
 for on board and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.710
 not for nothing 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.460
 the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.470
 But referees will fall to it 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.460
 The price is plentiful 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.460
 becomes 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.560
 then officially was excited 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.560
 this one became 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.490
 that would be 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.890
 we will make a nice thing later 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.240
 toni kroos will treat you as super 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.240
 shotgun and brings the cheap 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.020
 and again not 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.020
 The monastery was brought down 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.300
 reason probably was that at one 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 not decided on a criminal offense 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.750
 that was 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.400
 a corner results from this action 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.400
 the switzerland really nice 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.330
 a macho with the bible 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.330
 instead of 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.660
 rise again stop again 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.660
 is 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.430
 Naturally 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.430
 to him 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.680
 they have 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.090
 but no chance with these cards 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.790
 We are in the second half and she 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.480
 incisions fly there 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.480
 not quite 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.530
 the uci 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.470
 the second is not on tour against the 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.060
 German gets involved a bit 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.480
 comes told 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.480
 everything done 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.760
 planned on this action 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.969
 also had 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.509
 heralds from the side 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.509
 recorded 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.919
 the yellow card 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.690
 games this case but of course very 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.690
 clearly all played 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.240
 actions that was on it 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.590
 the gate over 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.590
 mostly 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.110
 04 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:18.110
 until maybe this action 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.470
 to press the meanwhile into a good one 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.450
 and see here 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.450
 such a nice profit was 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.199
 54 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.389
 the possibility does not want to 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.389
 miss 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:06:01.609
 a team of anthropologists big question 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:01.609
 has that been yes? 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.010
 that's the question individual lay that 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.750
 Result in regular play time is that 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.000
 Realistic inside what do you mean 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.770
 terrible days for this very over 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.520
 your 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.520
 how the game ends
