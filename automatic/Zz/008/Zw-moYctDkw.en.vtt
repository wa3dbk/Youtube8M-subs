00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
finally sometimes a bit too light for

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.190 
finally sometimes a bit too light for
correcting<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.430> I've<00:00:35.820> got<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.480> deep<00:00:36.899> risk

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

which<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.610> more<00:00:38.730> deeper<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
which is just a bit more deeper as a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.299 
which is just a bit more deeper as a
corrector<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> shades
