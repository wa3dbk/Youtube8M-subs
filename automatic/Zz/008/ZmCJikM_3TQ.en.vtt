what up guys real touch team out here
back<00:00:02.280> your<00:00:02.610> first<00:00:02.909> java<00:00:03.510> tutorial<00:00:03.810> now<00:00:04.770> this

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
back your first java tutorial now this

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.509 
back your first java tutorial now this
is<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.609> second<00:00:06.210> time<00:00:06.540> uploading<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.529> just

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
is my second time uploading this just

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.950 
is my second time uploading this just
because<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.880> didn't<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.210> know<00:00:09.450> what<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> do

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
because I didn't really know what to do

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.959 
because I didn't really know what to do
as<00:00:10.200> far<00:00:10.469> as<00:00:10.500> showing<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.550> guys<00:00:11.639> how<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.790> do

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
as far as showing you guys how to do

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.240 
as far as showing you guys how to do
Java<00:00:12.300> or<00:00:12.599> applets<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.500> I've<00:00:13.650> decided<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.130> go

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
Java or applets and I've decided to go

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.910 
Java or applets and I've decided to go
with<00:00:14.280> applets

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
with applets

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.710 
with applets
just<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.789> put<00:00:18.060> applets<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
just because you can put applets into a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.890 
just because you can put applets into a
website<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:19.800> thinking<00:00:19.920> maybe<00:00:20.900> show

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
website and I was thinking maybe show

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.849 
website and I was thinking maybe show
you<00:00:21.960> guys<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> corporate<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
you guys how to corporate that

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.700 
you guys how to corporate that
incorporate<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.000> into<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.359> website<00:00:24.660> later<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
incorporate that into a website later so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
incorporate that into a website later so
I'm<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.369> showing<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> series<00:00:27.570> on

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
I'm going to be showing you a series on

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.919 
I'm going to be showing you a series on
how<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> make<00:00:28.260> Java<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.980> applets<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.750> only

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
how to make Java with applets the only

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.170 
how to make Java with applets the only
difference<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.890> again<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
difference is that it can again go on a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.600 
difference is that it can again go on a
web<00:00:33.329> browser<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.100> yeah<00:00:35.100> let's<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.399> ahead<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
web browser so yeah let's go ahead and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.100 
web browser so yeah let's go ahead and
get<00:00:35.700> started<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.630> off<00:00:36.840> we're<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
get started so first off we're going to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.520 
get started so first off we're going to
import<00:00:37.469> well<00:00:37.739> I've<00:00:38.129> created<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.700> new<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.530> project

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
import well I've created a new a project

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.900 
import well I've created a new a project
here<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:40.829> called<00:00:41.129> applet<00:00:41.460> tutorial<00:00:41.850> if

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
here it's just called applet tutorial if

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.069 
here it's just called applet tutorial if
you<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.180> how<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> file

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you don't know how to do that go to file

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.650 
you don't know how to do that go to file
new<00:00:43.110> Java<00:00:43.920> project<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> went<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
new Java project and then I went and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
new Java project and then I went and
added<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.079> class<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
added a class so you just go here and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.470 
added a class so you just go here and
then<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.410> new<00:00:49.410> class<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.940> named<00:00:51.180> mine

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
then you do a new class and I named mine

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
then you do a new class and I named mine
main<00:00:51.960> class<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.520> I'm<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.879> here

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
main class so what I'm going to do here

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.170 
main class so what I'm going to do here
something<00:00:54.449> import<00:00:54.840> Java<00:00:55.170> applet<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> I'm

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
something import Java applet and I'm

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.529 
something import Java applet and I'm
going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> import<00:00:57.660> Java<00:00:58.050> dot<00:00:58.350> dot<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.390> we<00:01:00.390> can

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
going to import Java dot dot and we can

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
going to import Java dot dot and we can
create<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.730> main<00:01:02.730> class<00:01:03.799> this<00:01:04.799> should

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
create my the main class this should

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
create my the main class this should
already<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:10.430> made<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.700> guys<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
already be made for you guys but I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
already be made for you guys but I
believe<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.310> reason<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> what

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
believe that for some reason so what

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.460 
believe that for some reason so what
we're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.200> we're<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.660 
we're going to do here is we're going to
go<00:01:16.590> ahead<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.860> extends<00:01:18.619> applet<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
go ahead and extends applet and this is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
go ahead and extends applet and this is
this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> why<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.420> imported<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this is why we imported this to use this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.260 
this is why we imported this to use this
applet<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:23.820> we're<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
applet and what we're going to do is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
applet and what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> implements<00:01:26.150> runnable<00:01:27.290> and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
we're going to implements runnable and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
we're going to implements runnable and
that's<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:28.979> capital<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that's what they capital are in the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
that's what they capital are in the
apple<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> capital<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.320> see

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
apple is with the capital a so you see

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
apple is with the capital a so you see
we<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.710> error<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.909> use

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
we get an error here it's because we use

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.170 
we get an error here it's because we use
runnable<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.960> use<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> public<00:01:34.890> void<00:01:35.189> run

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
runnable to use the public void run

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.940 
runnable to use the public void run
method<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.320> we're<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
method so what we're going to do here is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
method so what we're going to do here is
we're<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> setup<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> basic<00:01:39.000> skeleton

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
we're going to setup the basic skeleton

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.969 
we're going to setup the basic skeleton
for<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:39.869> applet<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.920> do

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
for an applet so we're going to do

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:51.020 
for an applet so we're going to do

public<00:02:06.910> void<00:02:08.050> run<00:02:09.100> which<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.250> why<00:02:10.399> we<00:02:10.610> use<00:02:10.729> that

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
public void run which is why we use that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.220 
public void run which is why we use that
implements<00:02:12.640> okay<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.720> basic

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
implements okay so this is the basic

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.960 
implements okay so this is the basic
skeleton<00:02:15.680> right<00:02:16.070> here<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.460> if<00:02:16.520> we<00:02:16.550> go<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.820> and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
skeleton right here so if we go in and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.940 
skeleton right here so if we go in and
play<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:17.930> we<00:02:18.080> do<00:02:18.230> get<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> window<00:02:18.770> right

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
play it you see we do get a window right

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
play it you see we do get a window right
now<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.520> all<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.390> code<00:02:20.630> just<00:02:20.840> went

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
now and that all of this code just went

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
now and that all of this code just went
ahead<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.530> made<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> window<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.490> what<00:02:22.910> does

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
ahead and made a window so what does

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.810 
ahead and made a window so what does
this<00:02:23.150> mean<00:02:23.480> exactly<00:02:23.750> well<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:25.190> public<00:02:25.580> means

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
this mean exactly well the public means

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.730 
this mean exactly well the public means
that<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.810> get<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.170> from<00:02:27.290> any<00:02:27.470> class

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
that you can get to it from any class

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.930 
that you can get to it from any class
you've<00:02:28.010> had<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.310> from<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.500> had<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.190> lot<00:02:31.820> of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
you've had it from you had this a lot of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.340 
you've had it from you had this a lot of
classes<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.510> wanted<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.840> refer<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.080> say

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
classes and you wanted to refer to say

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.830 
classes and you wanted to refer to say
this<00:02:33.560> class<00:02:33.830> here<00:02:34.070> or<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:34.910> method<00:02:35.150> then<00:02:35.810> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
this class here or this method then you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.230 
this class here or this method then you
would<00:02:37.480> well<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:39.050> refer<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.910> void

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
would well you can refer to it this void

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.930 
would well you can refer to it this void
means<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.660> does<00:02:41.810> not<00:02:41.930> have<00:02:42.140> return<00:02:42.500> value<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
means it does not have return value so

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.910 
means it does not have return value so
like<00:02:44.420> if<00:02:44.660> we<00:02:44.870> wanted<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.260> store<00:02:45.530> an<00:02:45.620> integer

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
like if we wanted to store an integer

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.410 
like if we wanted to store an integer
between<00:02:46.250> these<00:02:46.610> parentheses<00:02:47.090> which<00:02:47.270> are

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
between these parentheses which are

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.300 
between these parentheses which are
called<00:02:47.570> parameters<00:02:47.870> instead<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.890> public<00:02:49.160> boy

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
called parameters instead of public boy

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.460 
called parameters instead of public boy
we<00:02:49.459> do<00:02:49.700> public<00:02:50.090> int<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.600> we<00:02:51.350> would<00:02:51.500> say<00:02:51.740> like

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
we do public int and we would say like

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.880 
we do public int and we would say like
int<00:02:54.470> X<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.580> something<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.209> know

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
int X or something like that you know

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.710 
int X or something like that you know
so<00:02:57.890> there's<00:02:58.790> public<00:02:59.090> void<00:02:59.270> means<00:02:59.480> there's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
so there's public void means there's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.449 
so there's public void means there's
nothing<00:02:59.989> in<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.140> parameters<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.890> we're<00:03:01.190> good

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
nothing in the parameters and we're good

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.260 
nothing in the parameters and we're good
there<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.950> NIT<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.820> pretty<00:03:05.090> much

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
there so the the I NIT is pretty much

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.420 
there so the the I NIT is pretty much
the<00:03:05.540> initializing<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.860> this<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.190> where<00:03:07.340> you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
the initializing so this is where you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.880 
the initializing so this is where you
initialize<00:03:07.910> all<00:03:08.090> your<00:03:08.239> variables<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:09.560> start

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
initialize all your variables the start

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.070 
initialize all your variables the start
is<00:03:10.010> where<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.250> start<00:03:10.610> up<00:03:10.760> your<00:03:11.360> threads<00:03:11.750> or

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
is where you start up your threads or

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.570 
is where you start up your threads or
anything<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.800> want<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.010> really<00:03:13.160> start<00:03:13.400> up

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
anything you want to really start up

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.030 
anything you want to really start up
right<00:03:13.850> when<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.209> windows<00:03:15.110> created<00:03:15.500> destroys

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
right when the windows created destroys

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.009 
right when the windows created destroys
when<00:03:16.400> your<00:03:16.580> windows<00:03:16.880> destroyed<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.510> stop<00:03:17.780> is

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
when your windows destroyed and stop is

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.289 
when your windows destroyed and stop is
when<00:03:18.140> your<00:03:18.290> windows<00:03:18.709> stopped<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:20.150> run

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
when your windows stopped and the run

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.170 
when your windows stopped and the run
method<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:21.440> kind<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.040> like<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.310> step<00:03:22.670> event<00:03:22.850> in

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
method is kind of like the step event in

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.930 
method is kind of like the step event in

I<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:27.530> gaming<00:03:27.830> tutorials<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.459> my<00:03:28.810> my<00:03:29.810> channel

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
I have gaming tutorials on my my channel

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.300 
I have gaming tutorials on my my channel
so<00:03:30.380> I'm<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.680> be<00:03:30.739> referring<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:31.130> game

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
so I'm going to be referring a game

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.039 
so I'm going to be referring a game
maker<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> lot<00:03:31.820> while<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.180> these<00:03:32.420> tutorials

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
maker a lot while I do these tutorials

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.699 
maker a lot while I do these tutorials
but<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:34.519> run<00:03:34.760> class<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.630> run<00:03:35.900> method<00:03:36.170> here<00:03:36.590> is

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
but the run class the run method here is

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.259 
but the run class the run method here is
kind<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.190> step<00:03:37.400> event<00:03:37.519> once<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.090> add

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
kind of like the step event once we add

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.229 
kind of like the step event once we add
in<00:03:38.450> threads<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.500> would<00:03:39.680> be<00:03:39.799> like<00:03:39.980> every<00:03:40.239> 20

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
in threads it would be like every 20

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.580 
in threads it would be like every 20
milliseconds<00:03:41.810> or<00:03:41.870> something<00:03:42.080> like<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.350> it

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
milliseconds or something like that it

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.539 
milliseconds or something like that it
will<00:03:43.269> update<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.590> I'll<00:03:45.709> show<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.250> do<00:03:46.370> that

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
will update so I'll show you to do that

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.180 
will update so I'll show you to do that
in<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.030> next<00:03:47.299> tutorials<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:48.860> yeah<00:03:49.040> that's

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
in the next tutorials but yeah that's

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.580 
in the next tutorials but yeah that's
pretty<00:03:49.340> much<00:03:49.580> it<00:03:49.940> these<00:03:50.120> are<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.630> can<00:03:50.810> kind<00:03:51.560> of

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
pretty much it these are you can kind of

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.630 
pretty much it these are you can kind of
look<00:03:51.709> at<00:03:51.860> these<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.190> all<00:03:52.400> like<00:03:54.160> events<00:03:55.160> from

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
look at these is all like events from

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.350 
look at these is all like events from
game<00:03:55.820> maker<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.840> know<00:03:56.930> like<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.620> ni<00:03:58.489> ni<00:03:59.299> t

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
game maker so you know like that ni ni t

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.330 
game maker so you know like that ni ni t
would<00:03:59.750> be<00:03:59.870> kind<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.110> be<00:04:00.230> like<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.530> create

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
would be kind of be like the create

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.970 
would be kind of be like the create
