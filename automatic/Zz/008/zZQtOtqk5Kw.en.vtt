top and also a fifth hook on the top and
a<00:01:29.610> latch<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> pull<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> door

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
a latch so we're going to pull the door

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.060 
a latch so we're going to pull the door
up<00:01:34.729> make<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> lines<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.950> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
up make sure that it lines up at all of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.480 
up make sure that it lines up at all of
those<00:01:38.659> as<00:01:39.659> well<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.320> top<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
those as well as the one on top which it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
those as well as the one on top which it
is<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.439> top<00:01:43.619> won't<00:01:43.890> snap<00:01:44.130> down<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is and the top won't snap down so the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
is and the top won't snap down so the
second<00:01:46.829> step<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.189> complete<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.210> of

second step is complete it the back of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
second step is complete it the back of
the<00:01:48.450> trap

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
difficult we're going to put the trigger

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:58.020 
difficult we're going to put the trigger
in<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.190> bottom<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.760> Pam

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
in there and on the bottom of the Pam

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.349 
in there and on the bottom of the Pam
there's<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.780> couple<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.700> places<00:03:00.700> where<00:03:01.239> it's

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
there's a couple of places where it's

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.390 
there's a couple of places where it's
been<00:03:01.540> out<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.139> trigger<00:03:02.470> rod<00:03:02.829> goes<00:03:03.130> in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.690 
been out that this trigger rod goes in
we<00:03:03.639> want<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.060> opening<00:03:04.450> cut<00:03:04.660> in<00:03:04.810> here<00:03:05.700> you'd

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
we want the opening cut in here you'd

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.759 
we want the opening cut in here you'd
really<00:03:07.030> help<00:03:07.180> yourself<00:03:07.389> if<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.230> would<00:03:08.440> file

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
really help yourself if you would file

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.640 
really help yourself if you would file
or<00:03:09.130> sand<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.850> tip<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.450> there<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:11.019> opposed<00:03:11.530> to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
or sand a tip on there as opposed to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.680 
or sand a tip on there as opposed to
being<00:03:11.829> square<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.209> makes<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.510> much

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
being square that just makes it much
