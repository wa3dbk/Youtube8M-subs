okay<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.190> flat<00:00:50.700> side<00:00:51.149> every<00:00:51.629> rock<00:00:51.809> has

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
okay now on the flat side every rock has

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
okay now on the flat side every rock has
a<00:00:52.050> flat<00:00:52.410> side<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.100> sort<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.789> rounded<00:00:54.270> curved

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
a flat side and sort of a rounded curved

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
a flat side and sort of a rounded curved
side<00:00:54.840> you're<00:00:55.199> gonna<00:00:55.289> start<00:00:55.649> writing<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
side you're gonna start writing some of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.110 
side you're gonna start writing some of
the<00:00:56.610> most<00:00:57.530> frequently<00:00:58.530> used<00:00:58.620> phonetic<00:00:59.520> chunks

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the most frequently used phonetic chunks

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.569 
the most frequently used phonetic chunks
or<00:01:00.300> sounds<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.530> reading<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
or sounds in reading now there is a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
or sounds in reading now there is a
trick<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.180> you've<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> write<00:01:04.019> them

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
trick to this you've got to write them

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
trick to this you've got to write them
backwards<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.640> wanted<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> write<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
backwards so if I wanted to write an a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.539 
backwards so if I wanted to write an a
I've<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> write<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> backwards<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I've got to write this backwards it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.190 
I've got to write this backwards it
takes<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:09.030> bit<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.390> getting<00:01:09.540> used<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
takes a little bit of getting used to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
takes a little bit of getting used to
once<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.830> you'll<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.400> fine<00:01:11.670> that's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
once you get going you'll be fine that's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.420 
once you get going you'll be fine that's
not<00:01:12.299> backwards<00:01:13.790> yeah<00:01:14.790> wipes<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:15.659> off<00:01:16.430> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
not backwards yeah wipes right off so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.740 
not backwards yeah wipes right off so
when<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.610> write<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.119> you're<00:01:18.420> gonna<00:01:18.509> want

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
when you write your a you're gonna want

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
when you write your a you're gonna want
to<00:01:18.810> write<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> backwards<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.670> okay<00:01:21.060> now

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
to write it backwards like this okay now

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
to write it backwards like this okay now
that<00:01:21.659> may<00:01:21.840> look<00:01:22.020> silly<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> flip<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that may look silly but when you flip it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.240 
that may look silly but when you flip it
over<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> curved<00:01:23.610> side<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.479> looks<00:01:24.540> correct

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
over to the curved side it looks correct

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
over to the curved side it looks correct
it<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.820> magnified<00:01:27.659> look<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it kind of has that magnified look to it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
it kind of has that magnified look to it
which<00:01:28.890> looks<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.250> cool<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.790> me<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
which looks really cool to me now I

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.109 
which looks really cool to me now I
chose<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> write<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.920> single<00:01:32.490> letters<00:01:32.850> on

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
chose to write just single letters on

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.039 
chose to write just single letters on
the<00:01:33.570> clear<00:01:33.900> rocks<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:35.340> our<00:01:36.000> blue<00:01:36.540> rocks<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the clear rocks and on our blue rocks I

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.460 
the clear rocks and on our blue rocks I
chose<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> write<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.549> phonetic<00:01:39.180> chunks<00:01:39.720> maybe

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
chose to write the phonetic chunks maybe

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.940 
chose to write the phonetic chunks maybe
I'll<00:01:40.619> write<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.299> ll<00:01:42.299> over<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.409> again<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I'll write I ll over here so again you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.690 
I'll write I ll over here so again you
got<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> go<00:01:44.310> backwards<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.320> fell<00:01:46.320> ill<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.610> you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
got to go backwards I fell ill when you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.620 
got to go backwards I fell ill when you
flip<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.000> around<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:50.340> looks<00:01:50.579> correct<00:01:50.729> okay<00:01:51.240> now

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
flip it around it looks correct okay now

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.749 
flip it around it looks correct okay now
before<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.020> forget<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
before I forget you're going to want to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
before I forget you're going to want to
seal<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.170> something<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.740> make

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
seal this with something they make

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
seal this with something they make
different<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> spray<00:01:56.909> sealants<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.719> just

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
different kind of spray sealants I just

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.100 
different kind of spray sealants I just
had<00:01:58.799> some<00:01:59.070> clear<00:01:59.399> nail<00:01:59.790> polish<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.780> brushed

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
had some clear nail polish and I brushed

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
had some clear nail polish and I brushed
once<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.590> dried<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> brush<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> backs<00:02:02.880> of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
once this dried I brush the backs of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
once this dried I brush the backs of
each<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.200> lot<00:02:04.380> harder<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
each one so that it's a lot harder to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920 
each one so that it's a lot harder to
get<00:02:05.219> off<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.119> I've<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> full
