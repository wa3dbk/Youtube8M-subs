on<00:00:38.309> their<00:00:38.460> plants<00:00:38.879> now<00:00:39.030> suckers<00:00:39.510> form<00:00:39.809> between

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
on their plants now suckers form between

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.200 
on their plants now suckers form between
the<00:00:40.200> main<00:00:40.559> stem<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.940> branch<00:00:42.270> right<00:00:42.690> here

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
the main stem and the branch right here

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
the main stem and the branch right here
as<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:48.530> these<00:00:49.530> suckers<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:50.160> grow<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
as you can see these suckers will grow a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150 
as you can see these suckers will grow a
new<00:00:50.640> stem<00:00:50.969> leaves<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.350> eventually<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:52.980> off

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
new stem leaves and eventually put off

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.810 
new stem leaves and eventually put off
blossoms<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:53.910> new<00:00:54.000> Tomatoes<00:00:55.820> basically

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
blossoms or new Tomatoes basically

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520 
blossoms or new Tomatoes basically
gardeners<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.539> believe<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.230> suck

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
gardeners I believe that they suck

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
gardeners I believe that they suck
energy<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> main<00:00:59.640> stem<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> fruit

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
energy from the main stem and the fruit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.380 
energy from the main stem and the fruit
and<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.710> they'll<00:01:02.010> pluck<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> off<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.090> throw<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and so they'll pluck it off and throw it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.500 
and so they'll pluck it off and throw it
in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> compost<00:01:03.719> pile<00:01:05.360> basically<00:01:06.360> what

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
in the compost pile basically what

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
in the compost pile basically what
they're<00:01:06.659> doing<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.110> they're<00:01:07.290> throwing<00:01:07.710> away<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
they're doing is they're throwing away a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.300 
they're doing is they're throwing away a
brand-new<00:01:08.460> tomato<00:01:08.880> plant<00:01:09.240> though<00:01:10.310> tomatoes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
brand-new tomato plant though tomatoes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.100 
brand-new tomato plant though tomatoes
are<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> nightshade<00:01:12.090> family<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.780> plants

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
are in the nightshade family of plants

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
are in the nightshade family of plants
this<00:01:13.470> means<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.130> cut<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.790> sucker

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this means when you cut off the sucker

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
this means when you cut off the sucker
it's<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.990> grow<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> reach<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.100> placed<00:01:17.369> in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it's gonna grow you reach when placed in

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's gonna grow you reach when placed in
soil<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.030> water<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.530> now

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
soil or water so what I'm gonna do now

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
soil or water so what I'm gonna do now
just<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.610> demonstrate<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.540> run

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689

just to demonstrate this we're gonna run
a<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.900> experiment<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.549> gonna<00:01:23.670> cut

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
a little experiment here I'm gonna cut

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.600 
a little experiment here I'm gonna cut
this<00:01:24.119> sucker<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:25.130> right<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.340> very

so<00:02:22.670> over<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.940> next<00:02:23.090> seven<00:02:23.420> days<00:02:23.560> we'll<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
so over the next seven days we'll do a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.490 
so over the next seven days we'll do a
time-lapse<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.880> see<00:02:26.120> what<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.080> roots<00:02:27.290> look

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
time-lapse and see what the roots look

00:02:27.500 --> 00:03:32.320 
time-lapse and see what the roots look
like

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.660 

okay<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.500> roots<00:03:34.710> will<00:03:34.980> grow<00:03:35.100> good<00:03:35.460> and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
okay so if the roots will grow good and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.050 
okay so if the roots will grow good and
water<00:03:35.970> over<00:03:36.930> seven<00:03:37.290> days<00:03:37.440> how<00:03:37.920> much<00:03:38.100> better<00:03:38.430> in

that's a good indication that the roots
have<00:07:14.000> actually<00:07:14.390> taken<00:07:14.830> so<00:07:16.150> go<00:07:17.150> there<00:07:17.480> once<00:07:17.960> you

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
have actually taken so go there once you

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.720 
have actually taken so go there once you
begin<00:07:18.350> to<00:07:18.470> develop<00:07:18.860> new<00:07:19.100> growth<00:07:19.400> in<00:07:19.640> the

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
begin to develop new growth in the

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.900 
begin to develop new growth in the
plants<00:07:20.350> then<00:07:21.350> it's<00:07:21.710> time<00:07:21.950> to<00:07:22.160> plant<00:07:22.850> them

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
plants then it's time to plant them

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.420 
plants then it's time to plant them
where<00:07:23.090> you<00:07:23.240> want<00:07:23.450> and<00:07:23.960> as<00:07:24.620> far<00:07:24.830> as<00:07:24.980> doing<00:07:25.130> that
