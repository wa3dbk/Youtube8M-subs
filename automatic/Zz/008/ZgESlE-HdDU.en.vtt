00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
what could possibly have caused this I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
what could possibly have caused this I
don't<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.779> submarine<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
don't know because the submarine is a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.310 
don't know because the submarine is a
state-of-the-art<00:00:28.710> submarine<00:00:29.990> built<00:00:30.990> with

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
state-of-the-art submarine built with

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.709 
state-of-the-art submarine built with
the<00:00:31.679> skill<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> rocket<00:00:32.369> scientists<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.210> even

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the skill of rocket scientists of even

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
the skill of rocket scientists of even
higher<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:35.100> further<00:00:35.340> factor<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
higher and a further factor is that the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
higher and a further factor is that the
personnel<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.200> well<00:00:37.410> trained<00:00:37.739> people<00:00:37.770> and

personnel are well trained people and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
personnel are well trained people and
their<00:00:38.910> backup<00:00:39.329> staff<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.200> don't

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
their backup staff so I really don't

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.569 
their backup staff so I really don't
know<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:40.649> went<00:00:40.860> wrong<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.219> shouldn't<00:00:41.430> have

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
know what went wrong it shouldn't have

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.850 
know what went wrong it shouldn't have
gone<00:00:41.730> wrong<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.120> something's<00:00:42.540> gone<00:00:42.719> wrong<00:00:42.860> so

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
gone wrong but something's gone wrong so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.549 
gone wrong but something's gone wrong so
is<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.070> likely<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.550> human<00:00:45.390> error<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.899> some

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
is it likely to be human error or some

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.100 
is it likely to be human error or some
kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.800> technological<00:00:47.789> arity<00:00:48.600> well<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
kind of technological arity well it

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.510 
kind of technological arity well it
could<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.410> either<00:00:49.550> machine<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:51.570> man-made

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
could be either machine made or man-made

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.619 
could be either machine made or man-made
and<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.730> no<00:00:53.879> idea<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.420> most

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and you have no idea which is most

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
and you have no idea which is most
likely<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.050> no<00:00:55.640> sometime<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.030> will

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
likely this no sometime if they will

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.959 
likely this no sometime if they will
find<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:59.250> think<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> may<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.730> be

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
find out really you think it may not be

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.929 
find out really you think it may not be
in<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.590> IDS<00:01:01.920> interests<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.730> reveal<00:01:03.329> all<00:01:04.939> well

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
in the IDS interests to reveal all well

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
in the IDS interests to reveal all well
I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.600> official<00:01:07.470> signals<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> come

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
I think official signals like to come

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.679 
I think official signals like to come
and<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.700> well<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.270> can't<00:01:09.479> give<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and do it as well so they can't give you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.060 
and do it as well so they can't give you
too<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:09.960> information<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.680> might<00:01:10.799> give<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
too much information they might give you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.320

a<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> information<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> won't<00:01:12.210> give

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a bit of information but it won't give

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
a bit of information but it won't give
you<00:01:12.420> too<00:01:12.570> much<00:01:12.659> information<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.500> how

impressed no because it should not have
happened<00:02:17.800> you've<00:02:18.130> got<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:19.320> state-of-the-art

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
happened you've got a state-of-the-art

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.020 
happened you've got a state-of-the-art
submarine<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.070> you've<00:02:21.280> got<00:02:21.460> people<00:02:21.790> highly

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
submarine then you've got people highly

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.130 
submarine then you've got people highly
trained<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.730> good<00:02:24.730> clean<00:02:25.630> living<00:02:25.930> people

trained and and good clean living people

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.430 
trained and and good clean living people
so<00:02:26.980> they<00:02:27.190> should<00:02:27.370> not<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:29.290> was

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
so they should not have if it was

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.260 
so they should not have if it was
man-made<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:30.280> shouldn't<00:02:30.550> have<00:02:30.640> happened

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
man-made it shouldn't have happened

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.180 
man-made it shouldn't have happened
and<00:02:31.720> if<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.020> machine<00:02:32.410> made<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.920> should<00:02:33.100> not

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and if it's machine made it should not

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.510 
and if it's machine made it should not
have<00:02:33.310> happened<00:02:33.490> but<00:02:33.700> maybe<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.960> minor<00:02:35.740> minut

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
have happened but maybe the minor minut

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.940 
have happened but maybe the minor minut
possibility<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.570> machine<00:02:37.900> made<00:02:37.959> but

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
possibility that it was machine made but

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.800 
possibility that it was machine made but
it<00:02:39.280> might<00:02:39.700> be<00:02:39.850> forgiven<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.300> some<00:02:40.450> extent

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it might be forgiven to some extent

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.080 
it might be forgiven to some extent
because<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.140> was<00:02:41.260> after<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.860> trials<00:02:42.310> okay

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
because it was after all on trials okay

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.610 
because it was after all on trials okay
