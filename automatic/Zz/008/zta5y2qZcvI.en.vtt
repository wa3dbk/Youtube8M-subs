suffice perfectly as a stand nice and
stable<00:01:50.319> is<00:01:50.409> not<00:01:50.439> gonna<00:01:50.649> fall<00:01:50.919> over<00:01:51.099> and

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
stable is not gonna fall over and

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.999 
stable is not gonna fall over and
obviously<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.109> piss<00:01:53.289> style<00:01:53.590> then

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
you can really see these cases very odd

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.289 
you can really see these cases very odd
never<00:01:56.229> seen<00:01:56.439> as<00:01:56.529> before<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.579> I<00:01:57.819> continue<00:01:58.240> now

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
never seen as before but I continue now

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.120 
never seen as before but I continue now
that<00:01:58.599> finish<00:01:58.959> is<00:01:59.139> really<00:01:59.590> really<00:01:59.889> good

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
that finish is really really good
