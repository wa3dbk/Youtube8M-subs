00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.920
 wo what happens folks we are here in a 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:09.039
 new pan video simulator 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.900
 simulator of the platera and good we are going to 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.909
 try to do the dental transplant and 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.489
 As you can see they have updated the game 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:18.420
 and the pretty good bet between 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:22.030
 they have updated it to Spanish 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.310
 so let's try it is to say that 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.470
 this is the worst the worst 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 surgery in the worst operation I wanted 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 say that I have done because it is really 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.150
 difficult are good enough teeth 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 normally it's those four but we're going 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.750
 which are quite difficult to remove 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.750
 each and then exposing so 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.640
 the operation is complicated 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.310
 besides that I am a surgeon you know not 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.100
 I am a dentist dentists because 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:58.840
 they go in their dentist's operating rooms 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.840
 God, I am an operating room, which is that I am 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 sometimes Vladimir is actually 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.840
 quiet because he knows that I am his 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 personal surgeon I see it a little scared 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.500
 a little uneasy after he left 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.830
 the mustache does not come from Italy and I see it as a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.380
 little weird one but but good each 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.380
 well 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.979
 does what he wants with his body 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.340
 we give you aparatejo and with great care 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.650
 without damaging any instruments because it 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.450
 We give to 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 to the evildoer tooth 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 that here what happens is that you give 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 count to give you ardent evildoer or 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.420
 you have to go through the meat which 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.420
 gives us sense one does like this 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.600
 the same if 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.930
 a little better does not look has 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.930
 Pinta 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.350
 to see well 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 a luxury that tried and carefully because 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.460
 now 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.159
 This bleeding has stopped me well 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.549
 let's lower it a little bit the pulse there 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.950
 term that I pay for this I like in a 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.739
 put 71 are pretty good to see 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.020
 what I have to do is go with a lot 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.160
 watch out 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.160
 that 's why it 's 70 I'm tempting and so slow 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 you understand 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.989
 talent talent 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.600
 well there goes perfect I do not know why I've 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.660
 loaded the previous tooth but good 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.060
 so it is removed it seems to me that you have 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.370
 that removing a part is there is there 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.750
 is ready well alright well we have removed 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.190
 a tooth that does not look but hears no 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.400
 happened to see if we have to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.000
 implant 5 instead of implanting 4 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.000
 it is implanted that they are no problem 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.340
 to see this part is more complicated to 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.930
 we can 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.190
 we can not take care of the teeth of the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.190
 Throat will not pass 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.160
 this is your uncle most complicated son 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.640
 OK 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.720
 ok to leave 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.650
 we take it here and we give it to 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.319
 client that was in question 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.980
 I'm seeing that the meat is wanted 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.980
 sense 1 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:55.099
 justifying the loss of blood 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.340
 good is losing blood quickly 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.340
 so 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.720
 we are already doing pretty well eh 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.900
 now yes from this angle it would be a bit 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.900
 best 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.900
 lifetime 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.650
 little by little we are going to lower a bit the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.650
 pulse 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.759
 the heart rate better said 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.890
 to that 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.340
 your uncle is complicated to know extremoduro 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.340
 vale vale 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.080
 and we leave you a bit this 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.730
 we have already removed two bad now we 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.010
 are the two below that I say I say 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.010
 I will be easier come 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:07.139
 also 800 that are good for one more 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.340
 we are not going to complain either 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.750
 it's fine and now I'm here 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.930
 a little bit because this can be the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.930
 good 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.560
 in bagpipe this is fine now only 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.700
 we have to put the teeth what 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.310
 what's wrong 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.440
 I do not know what they are now I would say 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.969
 these are here 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.719
 Let's see 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.719
 not here 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.009
 OK OK OK let 's put already have 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:46.550
 put another one 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.550
 here 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.640
 it's complicated worth voucher voucher and voucher 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.300
 now in the part above I say that 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.300
 It will be one of these 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.460
 what's up do not fuck me uncle do not fuck me 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.180
 Oh friend 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.340
 you know what just happened 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.410
 that I put alone the tranquillizer and 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.969
 I'm knackered and that is what 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.159
 it means 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.949
 that everything we have done has not 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:27.899
 served for nothing I know well what 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.899
 fun is everything I shit on the bitch 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.090
 I was not expecting because I was 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.340
 following very well and as you can see 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.550
 Now he did try to catch a good tooth 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.190
 this is not precisely this look 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.740
 what happens that this is set to do 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.760
 madness but still I'm going to 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.650
 try 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.650
 look at it ojito ojito 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.800
 look look and 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.360
 maybe this even helps us 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.560
 help 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:05.420
 because the same has to be moving 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:08.300
 can not help us put it all 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.560
 well, my mother, how do I get it, you know? 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.860
 how I get it in a state of blind ay 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.860
 OMG 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.759

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.389
 dentist you also know why already 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.919
 none of me just got the title of 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.110
 2012 you know that it is not so bad a 5 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.539

 do this surgery or this I do not know 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.000
 this because I tried it like ten times 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.970
 more the times that they try it in 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.009
 previous video has been insane since 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.729
 they continued to be like this 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:49.809
 Candel and is good 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:49.809
