plus<00:00:00.240> we'll<00:00:00.450> take<00:00:00.599> just<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.840> few<00:00:00.870> minutes<00:00:01.079> to

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
plus we'll take just a few minutes to

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.929 
plus we'll take just a few minutes to
explore<00:00:01.589> our<00:00:01.800> starting<00:00:02.159> scene<00:00:02.370> file<00:00:02.610> within

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
explore our starting scene file within

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.050 
explore our starting scene file within
Maya<00:00:04.310> okay<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.910> scene<00:00:06.029> that

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
Maya okay so this is the scene that

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.540 
Maya okay so this is the scene that
we're<00:00:06.240> gonna<00:00:06.330> be<00:00:06.450> starting<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.770> what<00:00:08.460> you

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
we're gonna be starting with so what you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.339 
we're gonna be starting with so what you
can<00:00:08.700> see<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.269> really<00:00:09.990> we're<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.230> gonna

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
can see is that really we're just gonna

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.629 
can see is that really we're just gonna
be<00:00:10.469> working<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> relatively<00:00:11.309> simple

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
be working with a relatively simple

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.580 
be working with a relatively simple
piece<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.420> geometry<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.320> sort<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
piece of geometry this is just sort of a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.890 
piece of geometry this is just sort of a
stand-in<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> human<00:00:14.790> head<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.660> human

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
stand-in for a human head and a human

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
stand-in for a human head and a human
face<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.160> allows<00:00:17.430> us<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.699> is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
face and what this allows us to do is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.920 
face and what this allows us to do is
really<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.029> concentrate<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> our

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
really just concentrate all of our

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740 
really just concentrate all of our
attention<00:00:19.230> into<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.859> eye<00:00:20.100> area<00:00:20.670> right<00:00:21.630> now

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
attention into this eye area right now

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
attention into this eye area right now
as<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.020> mentioned<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.580> introduction<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
as we mentioned in the introduction the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.480 
as we mentioned in the introduction the
eyes<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.630> very<00:00:24.660> very<00:00:25.529> important<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.070> it's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
eyes are very very important and it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
eyes are very very important and it's
even<00:00:26.699> important<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.359> CG<00:00:27.779> character

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
even important in a CG character

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.599 
even important in a CG character
especially<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.769> you're<00:00:28.920> trying<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> make<00:00:29.429> as

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
especially when you're trying to make as

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.130 
especially when you're trying to make as
realistic<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.539> possible

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
realistic as possible

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.860 
realistic as possible
so<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> real<00:00:32.610> world<00:00:32.820> whenever<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.300> talk

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so in the real world whenever we talk

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
so in the real world whenever we talk
and<00:00:34.110> communicate<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.980> people<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.370> always

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and communicate with people we always

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
and communicate with people we always
focus<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.750> eyes<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.200> always<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
focus on the eyes we always have a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
focus on the eyes we always have a
tendency<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.190> people<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> eye<00:00:38.719> now

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
tendency to look people in the eye now

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.330 
tendency to look people in the eye now
we<00:00:39.780> also<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> tendency<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.100> with

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
we also have a tendency to do this with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
we also have a tendency to do this with
people<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.090> would<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.660> television

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
people that we would see on television

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.380 
people that we would see on television
or<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.680> movies<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.730> tendency<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> look

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
or in movies we have a tendency to look

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
or in movies we have a tendency to look
that<00:00:45.600> character<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> eye<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.980> same

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that character in the eye and the same

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970 
that character in the eye and the same
is<00:00:47.340> true<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.000> CG<00:00:48.420> character<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
is true for a CG character so if the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.459 
is true for a CG character so if the
eyes<00:00:50.160> don't<00:00:50.489> look<00:00:50.760> real<00:00:51.320> immediately<00:00:52.320> we

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
eyes don't look real immediately we

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.930 
eyes don't look real immediately we
could<00:00:52.620> tell<00:00:52.770> even<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.250> even<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
could tell even it's even if it's on a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.279 
could tell even it's even if it's on a
subconscious<00:00:54.180> level<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.960> something<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
subconscious level that something just

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.099 
subconscious level that something just
doesn't<00:00:55.559> look<00:00:55.920> quite<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.840> need<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
doesn't look quite right so we need to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
doesn't look quite right so we need to
take<00:00:58.350> special<00:00:58.590> care<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.399> start<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> pay<00:01:00.570> some

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
take special care and start to pay some

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
take special care and start to pay some
special<00:01:01.199> attention<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.280> eye<00:01:02.489> area<00:01:03.170> now

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
special attention in this eye area now

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.240 
special attention in this eye area now
let's<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> ahead<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.799> take<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> quick

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
let's go ahead and just take a quick

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.640 
let's go ahead and just take a quick
render<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.630> currently<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
render at what we have currently in the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.899 
render at what we have currently in the
scene<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> already<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
scene you can see that I already have a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.050 
scene you can see that I already have a
few<00:01:09.090> things<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.510> been<00:01:09.600> set<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.110> us

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
few things that have been set up for us

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.010 
few things that have been set up for us
so<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.390> I've<00:01:12.510> already<00:01:12.570> taken<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so you can see I've already taken the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.210 
so you can see I've already taken the
liberty<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.350> setting<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.770> things<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
liberty of setting up things like a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
liberty of setting up things like a
basic<00:01:14.700> skin<00:01:15.210> shader<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.990> using<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
basic skin shader this is just using the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.359 
basic skin shader this is just using the
mental<00:01:16.500> ray<00:01:16.650> subsurface<00:01:17.159> scattering

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
mental ray subsurface scattering

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
mental ray subsurface scattering
material<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:19.080> already<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
material and I already have just a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.980 
material and I already have just a
little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.250> basic<00:01:20.430> light<00:01:21.090> set<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.869> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little bit of basic light set up so this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
little bit of basic light set up so this
is<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.290> using<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.650> couple<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> simple<00:01:23.310> area

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
is just using a couple of simple area

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880 
is just using a couple of simple area
lights<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.689> also<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.380> basic

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
lights and we also have a basic

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
lights and we also have a basic
environment<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> responsible<00:01:27.119> for

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
environment which is responsible for

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.200 
environment which is responsible for
these<00:01:27.869> reflections<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:29.210> all

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
these reflections that we see here all

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.429 
these reflections that we see here all
right<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> give<00:01:34.350> us

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
right so really this is going to give us

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
right so really this is going to give us
a<00:01:34.530> chance<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.189> focus<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> eye

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a chance now to just focus on the eye

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
a chance now to just focus on the eye
area<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:37.020> won't<00:01:37.140> focus<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.680> how<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
area so we really won't focus on how to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.890 
area so we really won't focus on how to
build<00:01:38.159> realistic<00:01:38.939> skin<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.780> won't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
build realistic skin this really won't

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.929 
build realistic skin this really won't
be<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> course<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.530> how<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> set<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:40.979> any<00:01:41.700> kind<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
be a course on how to set up any kind of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
be a course on how to set up any kind of
lighting<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.619> said<00:01:43.649> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
lighting really this like I said it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.230 
lighting really this like I said it's
just<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> focus<00:01:44.430> strictly<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
just going to focus strictly on the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.660 
just going to focus strictly on the
texturing<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.290> rendering<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.460> few

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
texturing and the rendering and a few

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
texturing and the rendering and a few
material<00:01:48.509> tips<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.840> tricks<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.200> can

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
material tips and tricks that we can

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.639 
material tips and tricks that we can
start<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.340> eye<00:01:50.549> area

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
start to use for the eye area

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
start to use for the eye area
all<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.930> just<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> kind<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.290> explain<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
all right so just to kind of explain a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.200 
all right so just to kind of explain a
little<00:01:56.009> bit<00:01:56.189> more<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.759> particular

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
little bit more about the particular

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.789 
little bit more about the particular
environment<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.960> using<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
environment that I'm using this is just

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.340 
environment that I'm using this is just
a<00:01:58.920> basic<00:01:59.310> high<00:02:00.030> dynamic<00:02:00.450> range<00:02:00.600> image<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
a basic high dynamic range image and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.510 
a basic high dynamic range image and
this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> mapped<00:02:02.670> into<00:02:03.140> an<00:02:04.140> environment

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
this is mapped into an environment

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.389 
this is mapped into an environment
lookup<00:02:05.520> node<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.860> take<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.069> look<00:02:08.280> inside

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
lookup node and if I take a look inside

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.080 
lookup node and if I take a look inside
the<00:02:08.640> materials<00:02:09.030> tab<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> MIB<00:02:10.020> lookup

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
the materials tab this is the MIB lookup

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
the materials tab this is the MIB lookup
spherical<00:02:12.090> node<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.170> connected<00:02:13.470> into<00:02:13.860> a

the mental ray environment node okay so
if<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.750> want<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.960> learn<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.230> bit<00:02:28.380> more

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
about this note and just how it works

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.670 
about this note and just how it works
you<00:02:30.090> could<00:02:30.330> always<00:02:30.570> refer<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.530> our

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you could always refer to this in our

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.040 
you could always refer to this in our
mental<00:02:32.430> ray<00:02:32.580> online<00:02:33.270> reference<00:02:35.240> now<00:02:36.240> one<00:02:37.020> of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
mental ray online reference now one of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.170 
mental ray online reference now one of
the<00:02:37.170> things<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.550> set<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:38.970> far

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the things that I like to set up as far

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.960 
the things that I like to set up as far
as<00:02:39.300> my<00:02:39.510> eyes<00:02:39.960> go<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:41.190> actually<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.820> use

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
as my eyes go is I actually like to use

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.480 
as my eyes go is I actually like to use
two<00:02:42.300> distinct<00:02:42.810> surfaces<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:44.460> I

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
two distinct surfaces so this is what I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.490 
two distinct surfaces so this is what I
have<00:02:44.700> set<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:44.970> currently<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.450> my<00:02:45.570> scene<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.990> we

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
have set up currently in my scene is we

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.190 
have set up currently in my scene is we
have<00:02:46.650> basically<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.190> outer<00:02:47.430> surface<00:02:47.960> now<00:02:48.960> this

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
have basically an outer surface now this

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.810 
have basically an outer surface now this
is<00:02:49.410> what's<00:02:49.830> responsible<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.610> actual

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
is what's responsible for the actual

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.480 
is what's responsible for the actual
reflections<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.220> outer

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
reflections that we see on this outer

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.890 
reflections that we see on this outer
part<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:53.970> basically<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.660> clear

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
part this is basically just a clear

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.590 
part this is basically just a clear
shell<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.820> just<00:02:56.940> responsible<00:02:57.480> for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
shell and is really just responsible for

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.500 
shell and is really just responsible for
nothing<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> reflections<00:02:59.330> inside<00:03:00.330> of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
nothing but the reflections inside of

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
nothing but the reflections inside of
this<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.110> another<00:03:01.560> sphere<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
this we have another sphere now this is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
this we have another sphere now this is
what<00:03:02.760> will<00:03:02.940> actually<00:03:03.330> hold<00:03:03.510> color

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
what will actually hold color

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.780 
what will actually hold color
information<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.620> our<00:03:04.650> eye<00:03:04.890> texture<00:03:05.430> once<00:03:05.640> we

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
information for our eye texture once we

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.060 
information for our eye texture once we
come<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.180> start<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.390> paint<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.740> this

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
come in and start to paint this so this

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.700 
come in and start to paint this so this
is<00:03:08.220> my<00:03:08.310> particular<00:03:09.260> preferred<00:03:10.260> way<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.530> doing

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
is my particular preferred way of doing

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.760 
is my particular preferred way of doing
this<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.990> one<00:03:12.990> thing<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.230> keep<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.410> mind<00:03:13.470> though

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
this so one thing to keep in mind though

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.010 
this so one thing to keep in mind though
is<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:14.820> anything<00:03:15.420> else<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.900> is

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
is that just like anything else this is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.560 
is that just like anything else this is
by<00:03:16.230> no<00:03:16.260> means<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.860> only<00:03:17.160> way<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> do<00:03:17.730> an<00:03:17.850> eye<00:03:17.940> so

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
by no means the only way to do an eye so

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.000 
by no means the only way to do an eye so
if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.990> have<00:03:19.140> your<00:03:19.230> own<00:03:19.350> methods<00:03:19.709> or<00:03:19.800> if<00:03:19.890> you'd

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
if you have your own methods or if you'd

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.440 
if you have your own methods or if you'd
like<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.310> experiment<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> little<00:03:20.910> bit<00:03:21.120> further

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
like to experiment a little bit further

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.420 
like to experiment a little bit further
on<00:03:21.690> your<00:03:21.870> own<00:03:22.050> by<00:03:22.980> all<00:03:23.130> means<00:03:23.340> feel<00:03:23.490> free<00:03:25.430> all

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
on your own by all means feel free all

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
on your own by all means feel free all
right<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.820> first<00:03:27.000> thing<00:03:27.120> I'm<00:03:27.180> going<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.330> do

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
right so the first thing I'm going to do

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.170 
right so the first thing I'm going to do
is<00:03:27.650> actually<00:03:28.650> take<00:03:29.100> these<00:03:29.430> two<00:03:29.730> pieces<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
is actually take these two pieces of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.460 
is actually take these two pieces of
geometry<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.750> actually<00:03:30.990> start<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.230> create

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
geometry and actually start to create

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.470 
geometry and actually start to create
some<00:03:31.590> UV<00:03:32.100> s<00:03:32.160> for<00:03:32.670> these<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.120> way<00:03:33.240> we<00:03:33.360> can

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
some UV s for these so that way we can

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.640 
some UV s for these so that way we can
actually<00:03:33.600> start<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> take<00:03:33.990> these<00:03:34.200> into

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
actually start to take these into

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.680 
actually start to take these into
Photoshop<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.310> start<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> paint<00:03:36.360> right<00:03:36.450> on

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
Photoshop and start to paint right on

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.110 
Photoshop and start to paint right on
top<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.250> let's<00:03:38.250> start<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.610> outer<00:03:38.850> eye

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
top so let's start with this outer eye

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.150 
top so let's start with this outer eye
surface<00:03:39.420> I'm<00:03:40.170> gonna<00:03:40.290> go<00:03:40.470> ahead<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.740> jump<00:03:41.070> to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
surface I'm gonna go ahead and jump to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.510 
surface I'm gonna go ahead and jump to
my<00:03:42.060> four<00:03:42.390> panel<00:03:42.720> view<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.310> switch<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
my four panel view and switch to the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.300 
my four panel view and switch to the
front<00:03:44.700> view<00:03:45.680> let's<00:03:46.680> go<00:03:46.800> ahead<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.100> now<00:03:47.160> go<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
front view let's go ahead and now go to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.390 
front view let's go ahead and now go to
create<00:03:47.670> UVs<00:03:47.970> planar<00:03:48.750> mapping<00:03:49.220> let's<00:03:50.220> go<00:03:50.340> up

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
create UVs planar mapping let's go up

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.990 
create UVs planar mapping let's go up
into<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.640> options<00:03:51.709> alright<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.890> let's<00:03:53.340> just

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
into the options alright and let's just

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.790 
into the options alright and let's just
a<00:03:54.120> few<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.360> these<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:55.200> could<00:03:55.320> either<00:03:55.410> set<00:03:55.680> this

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
a few of these we could either set this

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.680 
a few of these we could either set this
to<00:03:55.950> project<00:03:56.310> along<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.730> z-axis<00:03:56.940> which<00:03:57.510> is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
to project along the z-axis which is

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.650 
to project along the z-axis which is
what<00:03:57.810> we're<00:03:57.930> currently<00:03:58.080> looking<00:03:58.410> down<00:03:59.310> in

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
what we're currently looking down in

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.600 
what we're currently looking down in
this<00:04:00.660> front<00:04:00.900> view<00:04:01.110> or<00:04:01.920> we<00:04:02.100> could<00:04:02.220> also<00:04:02.340> just

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
this front view or we could also just

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.130 
this front view or we could also just
set<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> camera<00:04:03.480> which<00:04:03.720> means<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.080> will

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
set this to a camera which means it will

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.470 
set this to a camera which means it will
automatically<00:04:04.680> project<00:04:05.220> based<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:06.030> whatever

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
automatically project based on whatever

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.930 
automatically project based on whatever
angle<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:07.050> happen<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.350> be<00:04:07.470> viewing<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.860> at<00:04:07.980> so

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
angle we happen to be viewing it at so

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.790 
angle we happen to be viewing it at so
this<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.270> my<00:04:09.390> preferred<00:04:09.750> method<00:04:09.989> here<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
this is my preferred method here and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.740 
this is my preferred method here and
we'll<00:04:11.700> also<00:04:11.820> tell<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.450> make<00:04:12.570> sure<00:04:12.660> that

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
we'll also tell this to make sure that

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.500 
we'll also tell this to make sure that
we<00:04:12.870> keep<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.170> height<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.590> width<00:04:14.070> ratio<00:04:14.520> right

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
we keep the height and width ratio right

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.060 
we keep the height and width ratio right
so<00:04:15.690> with<00:04:15.840> these<00:04:15.930> two<00:04:15.989> options<00:04:16.320> let's<00:04:16.859> go<00:04:16.950> ahead

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
so with these two options let's go ahead

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.060 
so with these two options let's go ahead
and<00:04:17.400> project<00:04:18.380> all<00:04:19.380> right<00:04:19.530> now<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.770> can<00:04:19.830> see

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and project all right now you can see

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.890 
and project all right now you can see
that<00:04:20.160> we<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.760> UV<00:04:21.299> Zittel<00:04:21.660> bit<00:04:21.750> apply

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
that we do have the UV Zittel bit apply

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.560 
that we do have the UV Zittel bit apply
to<00:04:22.020> this<00:04:22.610> if<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.700> take<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.880> look<00:04:24.000> inside<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.330> UV

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
to this if we take a look inside the UV

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.590 
to this if we take a look inside the UV
texture<00:04:24.840> editor<00:04:25.520> there<00:04:26.520> we<00:04:26.640> go

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
texture editor there we go

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.170 
texture editor there we go
right<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:28.590> let's<00:04:28.770> go<00:04:28.920> ahead<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.190> just<00:04:29.310> export

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
right so let's go ahead and just export

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.150 
right so let's go ahead and just export
these<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.600> let's<00:04:30.780> go<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:30.990> polygons<00:04:31.410> UV

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
these so let's go to polygons UV

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.720 
these so let's go to polygons UV
snapshot<00:04:34.820> alright<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.060> let's<00:04:36.330> go<00:04:36.510> ahead<00:04:36.630> and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
snapshot alright and let's go ahead and

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.700 
snapshot alright and let's go ahead and
choose<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:39.630> actual<00:04:39.930> file<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.500> we're<00:04:40.590> gonna

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
choose the actual file that we're gonna

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.230 
choose the actual file that we're gonna
help<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:41.730> we'll<00:04:41.820> call<00:04:41.940> this<00:04:42.060> something

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
help it so we'll call this something

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:50.180 
help it so we'll call this something
like<00:04:42.480> outer<00:04:43.080> eye<00:04:45.350> UV<00:04:47.840> there<00:04:48.840> we<00:04:48.900> go<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.560> for

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
like outer eye UV there we go and for

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.220 
like outer eye UV there we go and for
the<00:04:50.280> size<00:04:50.460> I'll<00:04:50.640> make<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:51.050> 1024<00:04:52.050> by<00:04:52.230> 1024<00:04:52.260> and

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
the size I'll make this 1024 by 1024 and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.210 
the size I'll make this 1024 by 1024 and
for<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.290> image<00:04:55.470> format<00:04:55.800> we<00:04:55.920> can<00:04:55.950> choose

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
for the image format we can choose

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.140 
for the image format we can choose
something<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.910> bitmap<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.970> right

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
something like a bitmap all right

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150 
something like a bitmap all right
everything<00:05:00.570> else<00:05:00.720> should<00:05:00.930> be<00:05:01.170> just<00:05:01.560> fine<00:05:01.830> once

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
everything else should be just fine once

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.880 
everything else should be just fine once
we're<00:05:02.310> done<00:05:02.460> go<00:05:03.030> ahead<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.270> press<00:05:03.390> ok<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.930> now

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
we're done go ahead and press ok and now

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.890 
we're done go ahead and press ok and now
you<00:05:04.950> can<00:05:05.130> see<00:05:05.250> we<00:05:05.370> have<00:05:05.520> our<00:05:05.840> UV<00:05:06.840> snapshot

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
you can see we have our UV snapshot

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.790 
you can see we have our UV snapshot
that's<00:05:07.380> been<00:05:07.590> exported<00:05:09.140> okay<00:05:10.140> so<00:05:10.200> I'm<00:05:10.680> gonna

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
that's been exported okay so I'm gonna

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.080 
that's been exported okay so I'm gonna
go<00:05:10.950> ahead<00:05:11.070> now<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.310> just<00:05:11.520> take<00:05:11.700> this<00:05:11.820> outer

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
go ahead now and just take this outer

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.030 
go ahead now and just take this outer
eye<00:05:12.210> in<00:05:12.510> for<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.720> time<00:05:12.960> being<00:05:13.200> I'll<00:05:13.440> put<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.950> on

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
eye in for the time being I'll put it on

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.910 
eye in for the time being I'll put it on
its<00:05:14.190> own<00:05:14.310> layer<00:05:18.290> just<00:05:19.290> name<00:05:19.470> this<00:05:19.620> something

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
its own layer just name this something

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.200 
its own layer just name this something
so<00:05:20.040> we<00:05:20.130> can<00:05:20.250> actually<00:05:20.370> keep<00:05:20.580> track<00:05:20.850> of<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.090> what

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
so we can actually keep track of it what

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.330 
so we can actually keep track of it what
this'll<00:05:21.420> let<00:05:21.600> me<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.860> temporarily

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
this'll let me do is just temporarily

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.370 
this'll let me do is just temporarily
hide<00:05:23.670> this<00:05:23.910> or<00:05:24.180> unhide<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:24.780> whenever<00:05:25.140> I<00:05:25.200> need

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
hide this or unhide it whenever I need

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.020 
hide this or unhide it whenever I need
to<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:26.430> will<00:05:26.550> just<00:05:26.610> give<00:05:26.790> me<00:05:26.850> a<00:05:26.880> little

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
to and this will just give me a little

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.390 
to and this will just give me a little
bit<00:05:27.150> easier<00:05:27.480> access<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.220> little<00:05:29.220> inner

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
bit easier access to this little inner

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.910 
bit easier access to this little inner
part<00:05:29.670> of<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.820> eye<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:31.260> let's<00:05:31.410> do<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.590> exact

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
part of the eye so let's do the exact

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.430 
part of the eye so let's do the exact
same<00:05:32.130> thing<00:05:32.340> for<00:05:32.370> this<00:05:32.690> with<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:33.840> inner<00:05:34.350> eye

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
same thing for this with this inner eye

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.100 
same thing for this with this inner eye
selected<00:05:34.980> I'll<00:05:35.220> jump<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.520> my<00:05:35.610> front<00:05:35.880> view

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
selected I'll jump to my front view

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.670 
selected I'll jump to my front view
create<00:05:37.110> UVs<00:05:37.410> do<00:05:37.920> another<00:05:38.130> planar<00:05:38.460> mapping<00:05:39.680> all

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
create UVs do another planar mapping all

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.060 
create UVs do another planar mapping all
right<00:05:40.860> excellent<00:05:42.410> let's<00:05:43.410> go<00:05:43.530> back<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.920> the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
right excellent let's go back to the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.070 
right excellent let's go back to the
texture<00:05:44.400> editor<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:45.420> can<00:05:45.450> see<00:05:45.660> now<00:05:45.810> we<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:46.050> a

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
texture editor you can see now we have a

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.970 
texture editor you can see now we have a
nice<00:05:46.310> front<00:05:47.310> planar<00:05:47.970> projection<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.540> this

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
nice front planar projection on this

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.590 
nice front planar projection on this
just<00:05:49.980> like<00:05:50.040> before<00:05:50.370> let's<00:05:50.580> go<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:50.820> polygons<00:05:51.270> UV

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
just like before let's go to polygons UV

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.950 
just like before let's go to polygons UV
snapshot<00:05:52.730> and<00:05:53.730> for<00:05:54.480> this<00:05:54.570> we'll<00:05:54.720> call<00:05:54.840> it

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
snapshot and for this we'll call it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.870 
snapshot and for this we'll call it
something<00:05:55.200> like<00:05:55.230> inner<00:05:55.770> eye<00:05:55.800> UV<00:06:01.700> save<00:06:02.700> that

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
something like inner eye UV save that

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.110 
something like inner eye UV save that
out<00:06:03.080> again<00:06:04.080> 1024<00:06:04.950> by<00:06:05.100> 1024<00:06:05.130> will<00:06:05.880> make<00:06:06.000> this

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
out again 1024 by 1024 will make this

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.180 
out again 1024 by 1024 will make this
just<00:06:06.390> a<00:06:06.480> simple<00:06:06.750> bitmap<00:06:07.080> or<00:06:07.290> any<00:06:07.740> format<00:06:08.160> that

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
just a simple bitmap or any format that

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.250 
just a simple bitmap or any format that
you<00:06:08.370> want<00:06:08.870> press<00:06:09.870> ok<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:10.320> there<00:06:11.280> we<00:06:11.310> go<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:13.080> now

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
you want press ok and there we go so now

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.840 
you want press ok and there we go so now
we're<00:06:13.620> at<00:06:13.680> a<00:06:13.740> point<00:06:13.920> where<00:06:14.190> we<00:06:14.370> can<00:06:14.490> actually

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
we're at a point where we can actually

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.640 
we're at a point where we can actually
jump<00:06:15.150> into<00:06:15.720> Photoshop<00:06:16.140> and<00:06:16.320> begin<00:06:16.560> the

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
jump into Photoshop and begin the

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.060 
jump into Photoshop and begin the
process<00:06:16.680> of<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.550> texture<00:06:18.090> painting<00:06:19.070> alright

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
process of the texture painting alright

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.710 
process of the texture painting alright
so<00:06:20.280> within<00:06:20.550> Photoshop<00:06:20.970> we<00:06:21.270> can<00:06:21.420> take<00:06:21.570> a<00:06:21.600> look

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
so within Photoshop we can take a look

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.010 
so within Photoshop we can take a look
inside<00:06:22.020> our<00:06:22.250> realistic<00:06:23.250> eyes<00:06:23.370> project<00:06:24.030> take<00:06:24.990> a

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
inside our realistic eyes project take a

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.420 
inside our realistic eyes project take a
look<00:06:25.170> inside<00:06:25.290> the<00:06:25.530> images<00:06:25.860> folder<00:06:26.010> you<00:06:26.340> can

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
look inside the images folder you can

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.580 
look inside the images folder you can
see<00:06:26.490> here's<00:06:26.850> the<00:06:26.930> different<00:06:27.930> UV<00:06:28.110> snapshots

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
see here's the different UV snapshots

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.590 
see here's the different UV snapshots
that<00:06:28.740> we<00:06:28.800> just<00:06:28.980> output<00:06:29.310> so<00:06:30.210> let's<00:06:30.360> start<00:06:30.510> with

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
that we just output so let's start with

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.730 
that we just output so let's start with
this<00:06:30.690> inner<00:06:31.050> eye<00:06:31.250> UV<00:06:33.170> right<00:06:34.170> you<00:06:34.290> can<00:06:34.410> see<00:06:34.560> by

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
this inner eye UV right you can see by

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.140 
this inner eye UV right you can see by
default<00:06:34.800> Maya<00:06:35.280> will<00:06:35.490> create<00:06:35.700> this<00:06:35.850> in<00:06:35.970> a<00:06:36.030> way

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
default Maya will create this in a way

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.470 
default Maya will create this in a way
that<00:06:36.360> is<00:06:36.600> basically<00:06:36.990> a<00:06:37.110> black<00:06:38.240> document<00:06:39.240> with

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
that is basically a black document with

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.420 
that is basically a black document with
these<00:06:39.660> white<00:06:40.050> UV<00:06:40.980> highlight

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
these white UV highlight

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.640 
these white UV highlight
so<00:06:42.330> what<00:06:42.540> I<00:06:42.570> like<00:06:42.720> to<00:06:42.780> do<00:06:42.960> is<00:06:43.140> actually<00:06:43.290> start

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
so what I like to do is actually start

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.470 
so what I like to do is actually start
by<00:06:43.770> basically<00:06:44.100> inverting<00:06:44.790> this<00:06:44.940> so<00:06:45.120> if<00:06:45.270> I<00:06:45.390> were

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
by basically inverting this so if I were

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.050 
by basically inverting this so if I were
to<00:06:45.510> press<00:06:45.780> ctrl<00:06:46.230> I<00:06:46.350> on<00:06:47.010> my<00:06:47.220> keyboard<00:06:47.430> to<00:06:47.700> invert

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
to press ctrl I on my keyboard to invert

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.670 
to press ctrl I on my keyboard to invert
this<00:06:48.180> image<00:06:48.450> you<00:06:49.020> can<00:06:49.050> see<00:06:49.170> now<00:06:49.380> this<00:06:49.530> will

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
this image you can see now this will

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.220 
this image you can see now this will
give<00:06:49.770> us<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:50.160> black<00:06:50.790> outlines<00:06:51.270> which<00:06:51.840> I<00:06:51.990> find

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
give us the black outlines which I find

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.750 
give us the black outlines which I find
to<00:06:52.290> be<00:06:52.320> actually<00:06:52.890> just<00:06:53.040> a<00:06:53.100> little<00:06:53.130> bit<00:06:53.460> easier

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
to be actually just a little bit easier

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.540 
to be actually just a little bit easier
to<00:06:53.790> work<00:06:53.850> with<00:06:54.530> right<00:06:55.530> so<00:06:55.770> what<00:06:56.010> we<00:06:56.130> can<00:06:56.250> start

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
to work with right so what we can start

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.980 
to work with right so what we can start
to<00:06:56.640> do<00:06:56.730> now<00:06:56.880> at<00:06:57.030> this<00:06:57.180> point<00:06:57.420> is<00:06:57.600> we're

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
to do now at this point is we're

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.350 
to do now at this point is we're
basically<00:06:58.650> ready<00:06:59.040> to<00:06:59.310> begin<00:06:59.520> the<00:06:59.760> process<00:06:59.970> of

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
basically ready to begin the process of

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.210 
basically ready to begin the process of
hand<00:07:00.690> painting<00:07:01.110> a<00:07:01.170> texture<00:07:01.530> within<00:07:01.680> Photoshop

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
hand painting a texture within Photoshop

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.440 
hand painting a texture within Photoshop
that's<00:07:02.700> going<00:07:03.000> to<00:07:03.090> look<00:07:03.270> almost

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
that's going to look almost

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.200 
that's going to look almost
indistinguishable<00:07:04.290> from<00:07:04.680> a<00:07:04.920> real<00:07:05.160> eye<00:07:05.430> so

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
indistinguishable from a real eye so

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.550 
indistinguishable from a real eye so
we'll<00:07:06.330> begin<00:07:06.420> that<00:07:06.630> process<00:07:06.690> now<00:07:07.230> in<00:07:07.350> our<00:07:07.470> next

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
we'll begin that process now in our next

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.950 
we'll begin that process now in our next
lesson
