00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
would be an absolute that's a good one

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
would be an absolute that's a good one
in<00:00:26.490> 2012<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.689> been<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> lot<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> stories

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
in 2012 there's been a lot of stories

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.679 
in 2012 there's been a lot of stories
about<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.830> funding<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> legacy<00:00:30.269> program

about how funding for the legacy program
of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> 2012<00:00:31.439> may<00:00:32.040> come<00:00:32.489> under<00:00:32.700> review<00:00:33.000> what

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
of the 2012 may come under review what

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
of the 2012 may come under review what
with<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> cutbacks<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.860> economic

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
with all the cutbacks in the economic

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.860 
with all the cutbacks in the economic
crisis<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.630> may<00:00:36.750> not

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
crisis do you think we may not

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
crisis do you think we may not
capitalized<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
capitalized as much as you can on the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
capitalized as much as you can on the
Olympics<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.899> it'd<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.649> bit

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Olympics I think it'd be a little bit

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
Olympics I think it'd be a little bit
the<00:00:40.950> shame<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> biggest<00:00:42.450> legacy

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the shame I do think the biggest legacy

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
the shame I do think the biggest legacy
will<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.950> fact<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.309> kids<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.879> just

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
will be the fact that kids will just

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
will be the fact that kids will just
have<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.360> opportunity<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:46.170> their<00:00:46.350> own

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
have that opportunity in their own

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.549 
have that opportunity in their own
country<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.250> watch<00:00:47.539> all<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.930> sports<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
country to watch all of these sports and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.500 
country to watch all of these sports and
just<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.340> inspired<00:00:50.730> by<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.329> think

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
just to be inspired by then I think

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
just to be inspired by then I think
that's<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> biggest<00:00:51.960> factors<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.710> watching

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that's the biggest factors just watching

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.100 
that's the biggest factors just watching
how<00:00:53.520> people<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.329> athletes<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.960> your

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
how people not just athletes from your

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
how people not just athletes from your
own<00:00:55.230> country<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.680> sort<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.719> heroes<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
own country but sort of heroes and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990

after<00:01:16.740> Jonica<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> effect

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
after Jonica it's that kind of effect

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
after Jonica it's that kind of effect
and<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.320> takes<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> spark<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and it just really takes that spark and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
and it just really takes that spark and
the<00:01:21.000> kids<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.750> somebody<00:01:22.020> doing<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the kids just to see somebody doing a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
the kids just to see somebody doing a
sport<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.920> may<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.189> ever<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.549> tried

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
sport but they may not ever have tried

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
sport but they may not ever have tried
and<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> sort<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> bug<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and just to sort of get the bug for that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
and just to sort of get the bug for that
and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.430> discover<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.909> that's<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> one

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and then discover that that's the one

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.429 
and then discover that that's the one
that<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.290> what

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that they want to do and that's what

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
that they want to do and that's what
they're<00:01:28.590> good<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.189> suppose<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> kids

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
they're good at I suppose a lot of kids

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
reasons what's your take on that whole
issue<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.220> difficult

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
issue I think that's a difficult

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
issue I think that's a difficult
question<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.390> mean<00:01:42.570> looking<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
question because I mean looking at the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.440 
question because I mean looking at the
the<00:01:43.470> reasons<00:01:43.829> they

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the reasons they

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.270 
the reasons they
it's<00:01:44.750> perfectly<00:01:45.170> understandable<00:01:45.280> and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
it's perfectly understandable and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.700 
it's perfectly understandable and
finally<00:01:47.119> is<00:01:47.299> chosen<00:01:47.570> not<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.469> it's<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.469> his

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
finally is chosen not to it's not in his

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.289 
finally is chosen not to it's not in his
best<00:01:51.740> interest<00:01:52.369> at<00:01:52.520> all<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:52.880> think<00:01:53.090> if<00:01:53.179> it

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
best interest at all and I think if it

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.289 
best interest at all and I think if it
was<00:01:54.039> if<00:01:55.039> it<00:01:55.159> was<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.340> big<00:01:55.549> event<00:01:55.670> like<00:01:55.909> we<00:01:56.149> end<00:01:56.240> up

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
was if it was a big event like we end up

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.789 
was if it was a big event like we end up
against<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.780> will<00:01:56.960> see<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.289> happening<00:01:57.649> but

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
against you will see that happening but

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.410 
against you will see that happening but
to<00:01:57.979> one<00:01:58.159> off<00:01:58.310> event<00:01:58.610> like<00:01:58.759> Crystal<00:01:59.119> Palace

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
to one off event like Crystal Palace

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.779 
to one off event like Crystal Palace
it's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.500> shame<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:00.770> people<00:02:01.280> are<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.610> gonna

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
it's a shame that people are just gonna

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.969 
it's a shame that people are just gonna
have<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.149> watch<00:02:02.329> on<00:02:02.689> TV<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.409> other<00:02:03.530> countries

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
have to watch on TV in other countries

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.410 
have to watch on TV in other countries
because<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:04.850> don't<00:02:05.060> think<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.360> just

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
because and I don't think it's just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.120 
because and I don't think it's just
athletics<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.409> city<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.829> when<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:06.979> see

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
athletics in that city and when you see

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.350 
athletics in that city and when you see
tennis<00:02:07.460> players<00:02:07.670> making<00:02:07.909> those<00:02:08.149> decisions

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
tennis players making those decisions

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.949 
tennis players making those decisions
now<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.899> think<00:02:09.170> golfers<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.880> key<00:02:11.720> for<00:02:11.930> a

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
now I think golfers to and key for a

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.390 
now I think golfers to and key for a
bottom<00:02:12.290> had<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.590> make<00:02:12.950> special<00:02:13.340> arrangements

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
bottom had to make special arrangements

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400 
bottom had to make special arrangements
so<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.180> people<00:02:14.599> will<00:02:14.690> come<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:14.959> play

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
so that people will come and play

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.140 
so that people will come and play
football<00:02:15.620> though<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.610> maybe<00:02:16.819> something

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
football though so it's maybe something

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.250 
football though so it's maybe something
that<00:02:17.239> needs<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.599> looked<00:02:17.630> on<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.080> other

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that needs to be looked on the other

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.050 
that needs to be looked on the other
think<00:02:18.470> it's<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.010> new<00:02:19.130> caddy<00:02:19.370> bc<00:02:19.670> UK<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
think it's just a new caddy bc UK in the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.800 
think it's just a new caddy bc UK in the
US<00:02:20.739> but<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.980> affect<00:02:22.519> racing<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.180> nap<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:23.510> affect

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
that's a difficult issue to talk about

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.949 
that's a difficult issue to talk about
when<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.950> don't<00:02:37.190> know<00:02:37.340> all<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.519> facts<00:02:38.000> but

obviously they've carried out tests I

the person that you have to feel most

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.679 
the person that you have to feel most
sorry<00:02:49.739> for<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.189> it<00:02:50.310> all<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.909> tested

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
sorry for and it all it is tested

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.360 
sorry for and it all it is tested
because<00:02:51.840> she's<00:02:52.499> had<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.889> live<00:02:53.069> with<00:02:53.099> these

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
because she's had to live with these

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.910 
because she's had to live with these
insinuations<00:02:53.999> and<00:02:54.689> accusations<00:02:55.469> and<00:02:55.650> people

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
insinuations and accusations and people

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.190 
insinuations and accusations and people
say<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.159> she<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:57.120> she's<00:02:57.389> claiming<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:58.049> be

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
say in she is what she's claiming to be

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.390 
say in she is what she's claiming to be
and<00:02:58.409> there's<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.889> way<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.159> she's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and there's just the way that she's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.179 
and there's just the way that she's
growing<00:02:59.670> up<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.849> I<00:03:00.120> think<00:03:00.329> maybe<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:01.739> welcome

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
growing up so I think maybe to welcome

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.069 
growing up so I think maybe to welcome
her<00:03:02.280> back<00:03:02.310> into<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.819> sport<00:03:03.090> obviously<00:03:03.900> to

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
her back into the sport obviously to

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.170 
her back into the sport obviously to
pass<00:03:04.439> the<00:03:04.590> test<00:03:04.799> Nelson<00:03:05.340> won't<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.790> letting<00:03:05.969> it

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
pass the test Nelson won't be letting it
