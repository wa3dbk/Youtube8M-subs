00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.730
 At the beginning they said yes with the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 Funfair fans that's always there 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.490
 something that is being talked about 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.029
 Do you think so? 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.740
 it is absolutely too sad it is bitter 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.560
 what actually happens with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 fairy- tale funfair fans it comes to me 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 in front of the boy in here are the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.340
 really only dissatisfaction 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.270
 only one wants to bring in one 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.610
 big mistake 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.690
 We showman is among themselves it 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.969
 a big family 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.129
 we have set up extra assets 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.289
 So let's leave that to ourselves 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.659
 communicate with each other and really 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:44.179
 I'll just say these bad guys 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:47.249
 Sometimes these people do not know the people 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.499
 just get the craft done now 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.460
 but we'll be pretty much in it this year 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.289
 to attack 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.989
 We said we will not let us 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.569
 more like no it's all good and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.339
 quite what you make doing it 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:02.280
 we are business people this is about 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.269
 a tough job and we want 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.200
 really one 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.090
 We want to be stones in the way 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.130
 about any say the apartment 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.110
 out of the world pulled out of the nose 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 she can somehow be there 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.090
 good with each other 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.439
 want to do good or even 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.030
 friends you mean you are 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.789
 Friends they are not friends 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.289
 because we are with each other like me 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.119
 said I have a big family 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.509
 and we are very much about it now 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.969
 watch out who we are dealing with and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.280
 with whom we talk when we interview 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.740
 Let's face it, honestly 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.540
 are with us and everyone knows honest 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.210
 fairy friend and 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.670
 he is with me here like to see me 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.170
 do not ask for an apache 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.730
 Of course you will then both say yourself 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.860
 Why should you believe it? 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.810
 I get a lot of money, we do that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.670
 we always volunteer 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 but now the good ones are saying 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.360
 will feel punished somewhere 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.520
 any people who want 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.310
 some business will turn into that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.500
 or any make things clean 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340
 write on the internet where that is 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.229
 take out 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.429
 that was soon still oppressive euro 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.750
 probably never in his life 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.730
 screwdriver in hand 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.740
 this is about any 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.590
 Rides the ride is closed 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.510
 Slowly the business is so ugly 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.310
 that panicked deepening work remains 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.650
 then really the voice away or she 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.240
 spit away what they take out everything 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.860
 do and then look 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.200
 now there are too young boys hanging around 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.360
 are mostly tuned that are ten twelve 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.470
 years and they really talk 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.310
 thinks there is a grown man 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.030
 in the back 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.880
 but i say facebook we must 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.080
 but you can not lift the weight 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.330
 Nevertheless 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.110
 Of course it will always be wide 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 entered 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.670
 look at those or or or it 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.440
 are somewhere successful hunter I say 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.690
 But they did not succeed 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.370
 the annual fairground friends do that 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.070
 live hard and I do it 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.709
 plead and i say such us us 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.019
 become one after the other from 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.420
 Fixed seat one hundred percent 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.010
 or you can also let him know you 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.500
 Write what you want to do 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.060
 I can not tell you but think 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.069
 a little bit over what you are 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.950
 Do it yourself or what she does 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.390
 make really good funfair friends 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.730
 So I do not think it's great 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.269
 let this shit be write 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.209
 honestly know each theme is not 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.310
 bad but you must not be naughty 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.750

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.920

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.019
 becomes his honest businessman 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 then it was with body and soul 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.099
 then turn to us like that 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.019
 I am not alone we are like 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.629
 said a large family and I are 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.310
 Very much to it and over it must 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.139
 think about it and not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.389
 simply for this we speak of 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.129
 The millions really invest 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.470
 Millions are and they must first 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.239
 times to be borne by banks and by 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.120
 everything so I would say 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.500
 guys makes me honest about that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 thoughts and whom you have other thoughts 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.889
 that you say you always want it there 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.359
 bring in trouble again then say 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.220
 I then do not go in with us 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.750
 then she does not have teeth in the fair 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.409
 much to look and then I would 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.799
 times thoughts 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.799
 So do it well and stay fair
