00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hi friends, I hope it's okay 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.279
 for you for me it's going great we get 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.600
 found today for a whole 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.639
 new video and as you could the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 see just below again and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.660
 well it's a joke I thought 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.839
 why not stick with what's being done 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.850
 on TV now and the release of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
 the new season of 6.13 story and well 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 it was a good subject so I got 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 says why not talk about reality TV 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.070
 so when I say reality TV we 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.779
 will avoid all that is kind love is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 in the pasture 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 the taupe thailand etc 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.780
 I'm going to focus on the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.870
 reality TV pure style hard 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 secretstory the sh'tis the angels etc 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 we will say that we will also hurt there 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.969
 on it I just ask you to me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.920
 say in comment if you wish 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.559
 again if you find that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 interesting if you find that by 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 interesting at all is what you 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.309
 look at what are you not watching 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.750
 do you think it's positive 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 for people is what you think that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.770
 it's negative for people maybe 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.270
 this is going to be a pretty fast video 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.129
 I did not let myself talk about it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 because I do not have an opinion that is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.650
 ultra developed on it I told myself 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 again it's something 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.290
 spontaneous I saw a commercial on TV I'm 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.479
 am saying go it's gone 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.950
 let's talk about that it'll be cool so here we go 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.990
 I have no potash and I did not say 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 for three quarters of an hour is what 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.939
 there are positives because there is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.759
 negative points 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.799
 my opinion personally I find that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.240
 reality TV 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.720
 what is good is that it's enough 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 entertaining that's it let's look 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.110
 we put ourselves in front of the TV we fall there 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.460
 above that's it can take us a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.130
 Half an hour and a quarter to an hour 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.479
 the front and this quiet or so 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 we spend the time it's enough 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.869
 entertaining true me that's what I 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 think of reality TV it's not 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.409
 something that we think about is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.990
 something we are asking ourselves about 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.200
 couch we look that's it's done 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.640
 the weather is nice after that it's 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.259
 maybe the only positive point that I 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.759
 find reality TV for me 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.770
 here at my age it's something 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.600
 quite entertaining I do not identify myself 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.210
 not to the character 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 but not in the voice I'm not addicted 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.400
 on reality TV I do not look at this all 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.080
 days 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 I happen to watch from time to time 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.119
 time I find it entertaining I 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.550
 find it cool 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.630
 this is simply after level 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.890
 during a negative 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.870
 I think it's not enough 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.450
 representative of the whole of reality and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.580
 I do not understand the word TV anymore 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.959
 reality for that because it does not have any more 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.840
 all relation with reality 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.080
 I find that these stereotypes and that's 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.400
 it's badly done it's more it's more of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.680
 true what is more authentic it is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.840
 more spontaneous we see that it is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.300
 as everywhere we see that it's playing on 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 sees that it's magnified for it to be 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.090
 entertaining 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.370
 of course it's more to leave 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.630
 crennel the secret story first season 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.130
 2nd season where it was it was rather a 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.980
 rather nice because it was the real 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.150
 personality we could see that it was and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.650
 that it was real life in fact 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.870
 finally new way to talk again 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.790
 once but now here if I 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.120
 I think it's too caricatural 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.519
 too stereotypical and that's what me and 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.110
 that they prevent me actually comic but that 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.160
 completely in fact I find that it's 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.200
 enough is enough 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.290
 Too many of you find it to say that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.390
 like that then I find that I find 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.640
 that's not great for the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.739
 generation of 10-15 years old finally 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.239
 personally that's what I think I 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.910
 do not think it's cool because there you go 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.910
 it's caricatural these stereotypes and the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.720
 kids finally kids we'll say that 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.000
 like that of younger age 10 15 years 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.150
 identify with these characters try 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.769
 to imitate and that's not it's not good 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
 because it's not it's not the real thing 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.350
 Life is not the real people that 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.570
 vehicle 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.440
 I think it conveys some 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.500
 bad times but bad ones 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.049
 bad values values ​​of the 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.780
 trickery of cheating a word that 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.410
 date from ten to twenty years ago the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.079
 trickery handling etc 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.160
 I find that for young people it's not 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.579
 something good because the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.799
 mostly 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.480
 finally Thursday most know that if 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.610
 you have if you are 14 years old and you 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.560
 do you are mature enough 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.170
 you will not have this opinion there but I 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.150
 find that it is to identify with a 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.430
 character is reproducing what makes 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.990
 and we do more finally the young do not do 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.790
 more too the distinction between what 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.870
 is true and what is not true and they 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.800
 feel like it's real life 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.910
 and he imitates that and I find it rather 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.250
 but rather not cool 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.110
 in fact, I think it's 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.010
 which is what stands out for me 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.140
 reality TV 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.450
 so the good thing is it's entertaining 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.080
 it's nice to watch we let ourselves 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.660
 let go 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.030
 negative point it does not represent at all 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.890
 the reality here is even reality TV does not 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.840
 represents more this type of program 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.080
 so it's over, but it's more 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.370
 too spontaneous and sincere so so that's it 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.650
 it's my opinion on it 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.720
 this is simply said on the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.400
 reality TV this is me I leave you in 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.419

 Hi friends
