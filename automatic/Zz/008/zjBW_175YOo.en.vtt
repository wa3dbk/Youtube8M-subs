00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.270
 The laserjet pro m 252 of w is a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.389
 printer with a printing speed 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.340
 of 19 pages per minute is trained 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 to support work cycles up to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.680
 30,000 pages per month although the volume 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.050
 medium ranges between 350 and 2500 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 impressions in the image we see a new 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 appearance next to the surface 3 of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.020
 microsoft what gives us an idea of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.910
 Its size is much more compact than 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.440
 previous models in order to be able 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 install it anywhere in the 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.239
 office even at the work table 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.609
 hardly occupies space access to their 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.190
 paper trays is front admitting 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 of varying size in the manual tray 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.309
 Your screen can be reclined for 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.889
 adapt it to our needs of use 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.929
 and viewing angle in the part 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:53.909
 back we have easy access to your module 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.949
 of duplex printing in order to be able 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.510
 release paper quickly in the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.149
 if any page is left 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.010
 clogged the connectivity that the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.199
 laserjet pro in addition to the option 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.420
 wireless with nfc is the traditional 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.850
 USB port and gigabit network connection 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.370
 ethernet we also appreciate the port 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.780
 usb hidden under this small lid 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.640
 in order that we can connect 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 any pendrive or disk from which 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.690
 we want to print some document 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.540
 compatible office either word of 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.920
 power point and PDF document 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 through the front we access their 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.700
 consumables we use the lever 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.070
 blue to move the car of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.720
 toner cartridges towards us if you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 they lift up they stay 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.320
 quickly released we can 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 identify the position of each cartridge 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.270
 color sphere 3 equipped with jet technology 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.580
 intelligence helping us by the tag 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.080
 identification of each color both the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.330
 toner like the hollow of the car we what 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.130
 They also show the bidi code 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.680
 allows you to obtain additional information 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.870
 said consumable the lcd touch screen 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 3 inches is standard on 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.140
 All models including the most 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.330
 basic with what we are going to be able 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 manage the work and deploy the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.860
 adjustments that we create more timely to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.480
 speed effects the new laserjet 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 have been optimized to print the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.440
 first page in just 11 seconds 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.630
 we check how using the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.030
 wired connections this is almost true 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.650
 with an average of 14 seconds when 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.300
 uses the wireless connection the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.670
 times are superior in any of 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.319
 the situations what is simple 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.359
 is 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.430
 just include the printer inside 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.689
 of a local wifi network so that this 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.999
 can be used by devices 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.489
 mobile if we also use the 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.170
 hp print application configuration 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.120
 it's instant we can select 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 documents including services in the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.319
 cloud as dropbox to print them to the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.730
 instantly here we see how the tail of 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.099
 print shows us the state of the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.230
 jobs in advanced settings we can 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.150
 select special paper and modify 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.340
 the quantity and quality of the works 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.889
 print the print of a page to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.389
 color in size a4 the optimum quality we 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.040
 takes a time of 1 minute and 16 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.099
 seconds getting some finishes 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.419
 Frankly good on plain paper 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.819
 printing documents in wifi mode 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.439
 the first page comes out in 24 seconds 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.689
 while the rest of the sheets are 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.400
 slows down the highlight is the quality 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.560
 achieved for the impressions of the day to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.180
 day in the end we liked the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 configuration simplicity of the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.780
 series and its rapid start- up for 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.540
 print jobs wirelessly 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.079
 from any device 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.079
 regardless of your platform
