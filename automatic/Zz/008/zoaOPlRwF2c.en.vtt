before<00:00:35.440> we<00:00:35.559> begin<00:00:35.860> setting<00:00:36.129> teeth<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.969> should

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
before we begin setting teeth you should

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.209 
before we begin setting teeth you should
make<00:00:37.450> sure<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.780> your<00:00:38.170> rims<00:00:38.410> are<00:00:38.710> adjusted

and the maxilla Graham you can take a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.720 
and the maxilla Graham you can take a
look<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.079> posterior<00:00:51.010> region<00:00:51.129> here<00:00:51.609> you

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
look in the posterior region here you

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.069 
look in the posterior region here you
can<00:00:51.879> see<00:00:52.030> I'm<00:00:52.180> almost<00:00:52.420> edge<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.930> edge<00:00:53.050> and

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
can see I'm almost edge to edge and

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.569 
can see I'm almost edge to edge and
we'll<00:00:53.410> make<00:00:53.559> some<00:00:53.770> adjustments<00:00:54.309> there<00:00:54.460> as

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
we'll make some adjustments there as

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.119 
we'll make some adjustments there as
well<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.600> other<00:00:55.719> thing<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.199> watch<00:00:56.230> out<00:00:56.649> for<00:00:56.680> is

that for this exercise the laboratory

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.709 
that for this exercise the laboratory
technicians<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.430> our<00:01:00.550> lab<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:01.329> set<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
technicians in our lab have set the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.299 
technicians in our lab have set the
teeth<00:01:01.929> on<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.170> opposite<00:01:02.590> side<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.100> they<00:01:03.219> are

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
teeth on the opposite side and they are

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.160 
teeth on the opposite side and they are
close<00:01:03.609> to<00:01:03.640> where<00:01:03.910> they<00:01:04.090> want<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.360> be<00:01:04.540> but<00:01:05.050> you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
close to where they want to be but you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.510 
close to where they want to be but you
should<00:01:05.320> also<00:01:05.470> check<00:01:05.800> those<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.370> make<00:01:06.490> sure

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
should also check those and make sure

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.550 
should also check those and make sure
they're<00:01:07.090> you've<00:01:07.450> got<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.780> proper<00:01:07.990> amount<00:01:08.470> of

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
they're you've got the proper amount of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.770 
they're you've got the proper amount of
overjet<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.250> overbite<00:01:09.670> here<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.450> can<00:01:10.600> see

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
overjet and overbite here you can see

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.270 
overjet and overbite here you can see
we've<00:01:10.960> got<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> little<00:01:11.290> bit<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:11.619> excess<00:01:12.009> on<00:01:12.250> the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
we've got a little bit of excess on the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.700 
we've got a little bit of excess on the
lateral<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:12.970> little<00:01:13.780> bit<00:01:13.869> of<00:01:13.990> insufficient

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
lateral and a little bit of insufficient

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.770 
lateral and a little bit of insufficient
overjet<00:01:15.159> on<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.580> central<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.509> want<00:01:16.689> to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
overjet on the central we want to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.210 
overjet on the central we want to
correct<00:01:17.020> those<00:01:17.200> before<00:01:17.650> we<00:01:17.740> start<00:01:17.950> setting

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
correct those before we start setting

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.859 
correct those before we start setting
the<00:01:18.310> opposite<00:01:18.790> side<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.570> can<00:01:19.689> set

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
the opposite side so that you can set

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.859 
the opposite side so that you can set
those<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.229> harmony<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.360> first<00:01:22.570> thing<00:01:22.750> that

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
those in harmony so the first thing that

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.590 
those in harmony so the first thing that
I'm<00:01:22.990> going<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.229> do<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.590> probably<00:01:23.829> adjust<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
I'm going to do is probably adjust the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.270 
I'm going to do is probably adjust the
wax<00:01:25.810> trims<00:01:26.140> over<00:01:26.380> here<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.860> make<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.979> little

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
wax trims over here and make a little

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.789 
wax trims over here and make a little
adjustment<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:28.630> my<00:01:28.750> overbite<00:01:29.079> on<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.560> side

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
adjustment to my overbite on this side

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.160 
adjustment to my overbite on this side
over<00:01:29.950> here<00:01:30.119> remember<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.390> for<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.720> lingua

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
over here remember that for a lingua

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.450 
over here remember that for a lingua
lized<00:01:32.380> occlusion<00:01:32.860> we're<00:01:32.979> looking<00:01:33.220> for

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
lized occlusion we're looking for

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.139 
lized occlusion we're looking for
approximately<00:01:34.210> zero<00:01:34.570> zero<00:01:35.610> millimeters<00:01:36.610> of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
approximately zero zero millimeters of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.539 
approximately zero zero millimeters of
overjet<00:01:37.979> remember<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.220> lateral

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
overjet remember that the lateral

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.280 
overjet remember that the lateral
incisor<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.299> incisal<00:01:40.600> edge<00:01:40.840> should<00:01:41.020> be<00:01:41.140> up

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
incisor the incisal edge should be up

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.740 
incisor the incisal edge should be up
about<00:01:42.070> half<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.460> millimeter<00:01:42.640> above<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.570> edge

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
about half a millimeter above the edge

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.090 
about half a millimeter above the edge
of<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:45.240> maxillary<00:01:46.240> incisor<00:01:47.170> edge<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.799> that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
of the maxillary incisor edge and that

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.859 
of the maxillary incisor edge and that
the<00:01:48.219> canine<00:01:48.579> should<00:01:48.790> be<00:01:48.909> approximately<00:01:49.390> at

I'm<00:01:58.420> going<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.750> actually<00:01:58.899> just<00:01:59.140> take<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.469> piece

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.529

actually<00:02:03.219> two<00:02:03.399> pieces<00:02:03.640> here<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.180> I've<00:02:04.299> just

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
actually two pieces here and I've just

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.679 
actually two pieces here and I've just
softened<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.140> really<00:02:05.700> soft<00:02:06.700> there<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.299> I'm

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
softened that really soft there and I'm

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.840 
softened that really soft there and I'm
going<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.930> adapt<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.530> my<00:02:08.800> rim<00:02:09.009> take<00:02:09.820> a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
look from the underside to make sure

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.660

that<00:02:11.680> I'm<00:02:11.830> getting<00:02:12.120> approximately

as you start to cut into the wax you'll

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.830 
as you start to cut into the wax you'll
find<00:04:08.989> that<00:04:09.110> those<00:04:09.290> parts<00:04:09.739> come<00:04:10.640> apart<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.330> can

find that those parts come apart you can

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.360 
find that those parts come apart you can
also<00:04:11.989> take<00:04:12.380> your<00:04:13.130> torch<00:04:13.489> and

with<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.979> rest<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.699> wax<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.239> have

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
with the rest of the wax that you have

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.129 
with the rest of the wax that you have
there<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:23.550> said<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.300> didn't<00:04:24.780> have<00:04:24.930> quite

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
there we said that I didn't have quite

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.070 
there we said that I didn't have quite
enough<00:04:25.610> overjet<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:27.000> central<00:04:27.330> incisor<00:04:27.660> so

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
enough overjet on the central incisor so

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.379 
enough overjet on the central incisor so
I'm<00:04:28.560> going<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.100> increase<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.580> overjet<00:04:30.180> there

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
I'm going to increase the overjet there

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.990 
I'm going to increase the overjet there
now<00:04:30.570> just<00:04:31.199> by<00:04:31.350> softening<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.040> wax<00:04:32.220> all<00:04:32.940> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
now just by softening the wax all the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 
now just by softening the wax all the
way<00:04:33.389> around<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.930> central<00:04:34.290> incisor<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.800> you

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
way around the central incisor and you

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.830 
way around the central incisor and you
can<00:04:35.160> see<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.550> as<00:04:35.669> I'm<00:04:35.880> using<00:04:36.090> my<00:04:36.300> instrument

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
can see that as I'm using my instrument

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.100 
can see that as I'm using my instrument
the<00:04:37.770> wax<00:04:38.010> is<00:04:38.220> becoming<00:04:38.639> molten<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.300> I'm<00:04:39.780> going

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
the wax is becoming molten and I'm going

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.710 
the wax is becoming molten and I'm going
out<00:04:40.320> underneath<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.100> tooth<00:04:41.520> there<00:04:41.910> so<00:04:42.540> that

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
out underneath the tooth there so that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.170 
out underneath the tooth there so that
I've<00:04:43.290> got<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.650> good<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.250> softened<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:44.910> I'll<00:04:45.030> be

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
I've got it good and softened so I'll be

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.700 
I've got it good and softened so I'll be
able<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.419> move<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.780> tooth<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.320> way<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.680> I

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
able to move that tooth the way that I

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.770 
able to move that tooth the way that I
want

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
want

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.810 
want
I'll<00:04:48.780> also<00:04:49.260> soften<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:49.949> a<00:04:49.979> little<00:04:50.100> bit<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.639> the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
I'll also soften it a little bit on the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.629 
I'll also soften it a little bit on the
lingual<00:04:51.150> surface<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:52.949> I'll<00:04:53.190> be<00:04:53.430> able<00:04:53.520> to

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
lingual surface so that I'll be able to

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.740 
lingual surface so that I'll be able to
move<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:54.060> buckling<00:04:54.690> really<00:04:54.960> very<00:04:55.169> easily<00:04:56.750> now

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
move it buckling really very easily now

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.300 
move it buckling really very easily now
I'm<00:04:58.080> going<00:04:58.289> to<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.500> use<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.680> little<00:04:58.800> pressure

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
I'm going to just use a little pressure

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.070 
I'm going to just use a little pressure
I'm<00:04:59.760> going<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.030> move<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.300> tooth<00:05:00.510> out<00:05:00.780> there<00:05:01.050> a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
I'm going to move the tooth out there a

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.850 
I'm going to move the tooth out there a
little<00:05:01.350> bit<00:05:01.500> but<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.490> backs<00:05:02.760> on<00:05:03.060> my<00:05:03.240> rim<00:05:03.860> check

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
little bit but it backs on my rim check

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.879 
little bit but it backs on my rim check
it<00:05:05.720> against<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.810> rest<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.350> teeth<00:05:07.590> here

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
it against the rest of the teeth here

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.520 
it against the rest of the teeth here
and<00:05:08.100> I'm<00:05:08.699> looking<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.479> make<00:05:09.960> sure<00:05:10.199> that<00:05:10.410> my

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
and I'm looking to make sure that my

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.980 
and I'm looking to make sure that my
over<00:05:10.830> jet<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.190> even<00:05:11.669> between<00:05:12.270> my<00:05:12.570> central

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
over jet is even between my central

incisors and my lateral incisors and

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.020 
incisors and my lateral incisors and
that's<00:05:15.510> looking<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:16.020> little<00:05:16.260> bit<00:05:16.590> more<00:05:16.650> even<00:05:17.310> to

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
that's looking a little bit more even to
