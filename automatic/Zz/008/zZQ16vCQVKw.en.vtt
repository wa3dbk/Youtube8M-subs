00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.000
 openings one outlines what means 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.040
 always demystify when I am 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.420
 I opened a book about it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.759
 opening is therefore an opening 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 Textbook then I see one 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.480
 huge variations tree of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.230
 different trains that you can do 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 and should and also hints on this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 Trains are the right ones for them 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.730
 opening but very rarely so extreme 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.770
 Rarely to be exact I find in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 this opening volumes indeed teaches 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.120
 hints why these trains are correct 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.480
 So why do you pull for example 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.079
 in the first breeding d4 yes why should you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780
 do that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.360
 or if you can not play the four 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.690
 why would e4 and so on and so on 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.469
 on 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 yes, why does the black 5 play? 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 why is springer often f3 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.160
 drawn 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.989
 and why then springer c6 and so on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 and so on 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.760
 and that's exactly what I want to ask for 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.920
 I mean, to follow you with you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.310
 I'll see the opening in detail 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.860
 look and see what is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 the idea behind this train exactly 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 this train now for example as 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.950
 next runner to c4 or 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.490
 runner to b 5 and so on 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.590
 and so on 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.590
 and I will try as well as 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.509
 possible the ideas behind these too 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.400
 explain so that you rise through it 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.570
 Could you just stop there? 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 has not as well trained 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.820
 that's my thought and that's me 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 you like this as much as possible 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.159
 I want to do that of course 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.049
 also know and ensure this video 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.479
 now exactly this entry video in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.509
 my new little series thought he was 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 I write in the comments which 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.990
 you would like to get closer 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.950
 get to know which one will like 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.710
 learn to understand 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.590
 So please write under the comments 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.930
 your opening wish that I have the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.940
 then once an officer with you 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.430
 together, of course, best 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.350
 and maybe even if 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.690
 you have a special question about 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.790
 a special variant and asks 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.060
 why does black suddenly pull this and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.070
 the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 or why should know at all 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.850
 idea now come in this posed 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.740
 weeks or something like that writes in 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.960
 Your comments and I will 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.900
 then look at it maybe then 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.690
 also the variant or opening once 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.630
 explain completely and so on me 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.310
 I am now on your initiative too 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.440
 I did not just order that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.880
 any videos in the hollow belly 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.070
 into it 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.330
 I should also be interested in you 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.060
 will of course start now 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.440
 to make the first opening to 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.290
 demystify 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.930
 but important is that he also tells me 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.940
 what you want to know because otherwise I can 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.020
 not to meet you and that wants 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.660
 I also like to do that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.110
 So I'm writing comments 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.800
 curious; excited 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.800
 See you
