can<00:01:45.149> click<00:01:45.360> off<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> him<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.939> then<00:01:47.939> let<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
can click off of him and then let it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.240 
can click off of him and then let it
have

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
have

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.430 
have
now<00:01:49.850> what's<00:01:50.270> also<00:01:50.420> cool<00:01:50.660> about<00:01:50.870> this<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.320> that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
now what's also cool about this is that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.350 
now what's also cool about this is that
you<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.740> actually<00:01:51.980> use<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.400> rush<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.150> well

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
you can actually use a rush this as well

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.900 
you can actually use a rush this as well
and<00:01:53.630> i'll<00:01:54.440> try<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.650> explain<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.190> as<00:01:55.340> how<00:01:55.730> i'm

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
and i'll try to explain it as how i'm

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.820 
and i'll try to explain it as how i'm
doing<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.390> what<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:57.260> doing<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.560> after

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
doing this what I'm doing is after

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.590 
doing this what I'm doing is after
putting<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.160> QP<00:01:58.460> contain<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.390> ball<00:01:59.570> is

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
putting the QP contain and the ball is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.390 
putting the QP contain and the ball is
snapped<00:01:59.870> I<00:02:01.240> actually<00:02:03.010> take<00:02:04.010> control<00:02:04.280> of

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
snapped I actually take control of

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.040 
snapped I actually take control of
Irving<00:02:04.880> after<00:02:05.270> he<00:02:05.360> takes<00:02:05.479> his<00:02:05.690> first<00:02:05.840> two

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
Irving after he takes his first two

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.230 
Irving after he takes his first two
steps<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.380> go<00:02:06.560> after<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.830> quarterback<00:02:07.179> so<00:02:08.179> you

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
steps to go after the quarterback so you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.300 
steps to go after the quarterback so you
see<00:02:08.450> there<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:08.899> actually<00:02:09.350> pretty<00:02:09.590> difficult

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
see there it's actually pretty difficult

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.080 
see there it's actually pretty difficult
to<00:02:10.820> stop<00:02:11.060> especially<00:02:11.660> with<00:02:11.720> urban<00:02:12.110> speed<00:02:13.090> but

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
to stop especially with urban speed but

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.670 
to stop especially with urban speed but
again<00:02:14.330> sliding<00:02:14.720> lineman<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.290> blocking

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
again sliding lineman and blocking

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.970 
again sliding lineman and blocking
running<00:02:15.950> backs<00:02:16.100> really<00:02:16.370> pick<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.670> up<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.800> here

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
running backs really pick it up so here

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.980 
running backs really pick it up so here
I<00:02:19.310> wait<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:19.820> him<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.060> take<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.540> first<00:02:20.780> two

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
I wait for him to take the first two

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.840 
I wait for him to take the first two
steps<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.590> once<00:02:21.770> he<00:02:21.890> enters<00:02:21.920> into<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.610> free

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
steps and once he enters into that free

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.699 
steps and once he enters into that free
space<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.420> actually<00:02:23.750> hold<00:02:24.140> down<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.440> turbo

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
space I actually hold down the turbo

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.380 
space I actually hold down the turbo
button<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.250> control<00:02:25.670> him<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> way<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.270> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
button and I control him on the way to a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.580 
button and I control him on the way to a
Josh<00:02:26.690> Freeman<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:28.870> now<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.930> significance

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
Josh Freeman here now the significance

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.640 
Josh Freeman here now the significance
to<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.739> is<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> blocking<00:02:31.670> running<00:02:31.940> back

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
to that is for a blocking running back

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.750 
to that is for a blocking running back
sometimes<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.770> can<00:02:33.890> get<00:02:33.980> around<00:02:34.250> him<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.670> it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
sometimes you can get around him but it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.880 
sometimes you can get around him but it
is<00:02:35.350> it<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.500> able<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.770> be<00:02:36.860> stopped<00:02:37.250> if<00:02:38.120> they

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
is it is able to be stopped if they

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.320 
is it is able to be stopped if they
slide<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> line<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.459> decide<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> blitz

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
slide the line to decide that the blitz

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.699 
slide the line to decide that the blitz
is<00:02:41.450> coming<00:02:41.750> from<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.050> blocker<00:02:42.260> running<00:02:42.590> back

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
is coming from and blocker running back

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.770 
is coming from and blocker running back
at<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.920> same<00:02:43.040> time<00:02:43.250> as<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:44.330> see<00:02:44.450> here<00:02:44.630> we're

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
at the same time as you see here we're

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.120 
at the same time as you see here we're
just<00:02:44.810> blocking<00:02:45.110> one<00:02:45.350> running<00:02:45.650> back<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:46.010> that

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
just blocking one running back in that

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.850 
just blocking one running back in that
hole<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.820> stops<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.239> blitz<00:02:47.450> pretty<00:02:47.630> well

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
hole and it stops the blitz pretty well

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.920 
hole and it stops the blitz pretty well
now<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.370> other<00:02:49.459> foots<00:02:49.730> here<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.630> over

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
now the other foots here is the over

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.770 
storm brave from the 245 and the nanos
this<00:02:54.980> year<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:55.610> finicky<00:02:56.030> but<00:02:56.180> how<00:02:56.750> I

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
this year is just so finicky but how I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.250 
this year is just so finicky but how I
set<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.200> up<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.670> see<00:02:58.820> right<00:02:59.000> away<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.510> like

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
set this up is you see right away I like

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.259 
set this up is you see right away I like
to<00:03:00.380> show<00:03:00.590> blitz<00:03:00.830> what<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.430> do<00:03:01.519> first<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.060> base

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
to show blitz what I do first is I base

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.300 
to show blitz what I do first is I base
online<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.959> way<00:03:03.170> when<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.739> show<00:03:04.040> blitz

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
online that way when I show blitz

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.789 
online that way when I show blitz
afterwards<00:03:05.060> they<00:03:05.870> line<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.470> little<00:03:06.680> bit

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
afterwards they line up a little bit

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.050 
afterwards they line up a little bit
better<00:03:06.950> because<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.430> will<00:03:07.549> coincide<00:03:07.850> with

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
better because this will coincide with

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.090 
better because this will coincide with
the<00:03:08.330> cover<00:03:08.660> three<00:03:09.049> see<00:03:09.560> how<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.769> looks<00:03:09.890> like

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
the cover three see how it looks like

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190 
the cover three see how it looks like
the<00:03:10.220> cover<00:03:10.400> 3<00:03:10.700> i'll<00:03:11.000> show<00:03:11.600> blitz<00:03:11.840> with<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
the cover 3 i'll show blitz with the

the cover 3 i'll show blitz with the
cover<00:03:12.410> 3<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:12.980> it'll<00:03:13.220> look<00:03:13.340> like<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.700> over

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
cover 3 and it'll look like the over

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.210 
cover 3 and it'll look like the over
storm<00:03:14.720> brief<00:03:14.930> setup<00:03:15.230> if<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.799> definitely<00:03:15.920> want

storm brief setup if you definitely want
to<00:03:16.280> use<00:03:16.340> these<00:03:16.580> two<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.000> I'm<00:03:17.470> coincide<00:03:18.470> them

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
to use these two and I'm coincide them

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.990 
to use these two and I'm coincide them
but<00:03:18.950> let's<00:03:19.100> show<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.280> guys<00:03:19.430> how<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.610> set<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:19.880> to

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
but let's show you guys how to set up to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.970 
but let's show you guys how to set up to
over<00:03:20.209> storm<00:03:20.420> brave<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.230> again<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.470> show<00:03:21.769> blitz

over storm brave so again I show blitz

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.920 
over storm brave so again I show blitz
and<00:03:22.250> Wagner<00:03:22.910> steps<00:03:23.180> down<00:03:23.329> over<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.660> center

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.050 
the line but I noticed that it works
with<00:03:38.900> greater<00:03:39.200> success<00:03:39.680> when<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.640> spread<00:03:40.910> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
running back and it is possible

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.030
