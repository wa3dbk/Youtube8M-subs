side back side front constantly doesn't

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.150 
side back side front constantly doesn't
matter<00:00:55.170> which<00:00:55.260> direction<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.039> it's

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
hit on the same core points so we go

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
hit on the same core points so we go
much<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> slide<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.100> up

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
much the slide first and then we get up

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
much the slide first and then we get up
kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> tilts<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.480> bit<00:01:03.600> by

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
kind of tilts back a little bit by

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
again like what we're doing here is you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.710 
again like what we're doing here is you
could<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.320> end<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.740> knee<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
could have end one knee like this and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.390 
could have end one knee like this and
then<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.680> were<00:01:22.830> bent<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.130> bit

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
then so this one were bent a little bit

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
then so this one were bent a little bit
more<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.759> world<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> almost<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
more in this world kind of almost be a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
more in this world kind of almost be a
little<00:01:25.110> lost<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.680> we're<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:25.950> doing<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.310> all

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
little lost but we're not doing it all

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.980 
little lost but we're not doing it all
the<00:01:26.610> way<00:01:26.700> because<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> small<00:01:27.479> surface<00:01:27.689> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the way because it's a small surface we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
the way because it's a small surface we
don't<00:01:28.170> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> way

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
don't want to be like going all the way

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
don't want to be like going all the way
up<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.960> small<00:01:31.290> motion<00:01:31.710> here

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
up so it's really all small motion here

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.219 
up so it's really all small motion here
so<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> slide<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.079> come

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
so we go to the slide but when we come

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.719 
so we go to the slide but when we come
to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> front<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
to the front we don't want to kind of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
to the front we don't want to kind of
push<00:01:35.970> forward<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:37.020> circles

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
push forward because there are circles

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.780 
push forward because there are circles
will<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.650> called<00:01:37.799> usually<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> call

will be called usually I like to call

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
will be called usually I like to call
the<00:01:38.939> medium<00:01:39.299> side<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.650> medium<00:01:40.950> size<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the medium side the medium size of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
the medium side the medium size of
circles<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.000> Valdez's<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.229> these

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
circles in Valdez's and these are these

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
circles in Valdez's and these are these
ones<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> hip

if<00:01:49.079> simpler<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:50.040> showing<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:50.759> but

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
if simpler I'm showing right now but

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
if simpler I'm showing right now but
they're<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.960> big<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.439> course<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.829> big

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
they're not as big as of course the big

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.399 
they're not as big as of course the big
circle<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.270> down<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.049> call<00:01:55.259> these

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
circle all the way down so I call these

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
circle all the way down so I call these
the<00:01:55.680> medium<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.640> medium<00:01:56.759> sized

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the medium and in the medium sized

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630 
the medium and in the medium sized
circles<00:01:58.170> we're<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.159> we're<00:01:59.430> pushing

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
circles we're going we're pushing

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.219 
circles we're going we're pushing
forward<00:02:00.270> now<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.170> not

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
forward now in this one we're not

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.499 
forward now in this one we're not
pushing<00:02:01.950> forward<00:02:02.460> we're<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.329> we're

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
pushing forward we're because we're

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.090 
pushing forward we're because we're
bending<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.899> knees<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.710> not<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:05.040> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
bending our knees we are not going to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.089 
bending our knees we are not going to
push<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.520> we're<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.360> actually<00:02:07.099> lift

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
push like this we're gonna actually lift

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.510 
push like this we're gonna actually lift
in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> front<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.840> push<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> side<00:02:10.520> push

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
in the front so we push to the side push

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.230 
in the front so we push to the side push
the<00:02:11.670> hips<00:02:11.819> back

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
the hips back

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.270 
the hips back
the<00:02:12.300> math<00:02:12.480> would<00:02:13.050> push<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.530> slide<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.160> then

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the math would push a slide and then

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.030 
the math would push a slide and then
with<00:02:14.460> lift<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.510> front<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.650> always<00:02:16.830> like

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
push forward of the pelvic bone and a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.000 
push forward of the pelvic bone and a
lift<00:02:38.880> up<00:02:39.090> at<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> same<00:02:39.720> time<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.680> lift<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
lift up at the same time and to lift we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.650 
lift up at the same time and to lift we
kind<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.490> engage<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.060> our<00:02:42.210> lower<00:02:42.420> abs

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
kind of really engage in our lower abs

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.660 
kind of really engage in our lower abs
here<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.560> push<00:02:43.770> one<00:02:43.980> run<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> lift

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
here so it's a push one run and a lift

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.000 
here so it's a push one run and a lift
butch<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:45.210> would<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.420> hip<00:02:45.570> bones<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.110> then<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
butch what would a hip bones and then a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.090 
butch what would a hip bones and then a
lift<00:02:47.280> by<00:02:47.820> tucking<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.750> lower<00:02:49.140> abs<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.830> one

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
lift by tucking the lower abs so one

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.560 
lift by tucking the lower abs so one
more<00:02:50.250> time<00:02:50.280> very<00:02:50.640> slow<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.240> I'll<00:02:51.300> put<00:02:51.480> if

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
more time very slow and then I'll put if

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.660 
more time very slow and then I'll put if
a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:52.260> faster<00:02:52.620> for<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:52.890> guys<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.430> side

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
a lot faster for you guys so it's a side

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.520 
a lot faster for you guys so it's a side
the<00:02:54.480> whole<00:02:54.630> time<00:02:54.660> I'm<00:02:54.870> doing<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.200> my<00:02:55.380> knees

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the whole time I'm doing this my knees

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.990 
the whole time I'm doing this my knees
I've<00:02:55.650> been<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.550> side<00:02:56.760> push

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I've been to I do it so it's a side push

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.180 
I've been to I do it so it's a side push
that<00:02:57.660> back<00:02:57.960> pushed<00:02:58.350> with<00:02:58.680> an<00:02:58.800> arch<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that back pushed with an arch in the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.000 
that back pushed with an arch in the
back<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.600> side<00:03:00.840> push<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:01.800> I

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
back and then a side push and then I

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
back and then a side push and then I
push<00:03:02.190> forward<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.700> lift<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.810> front<00:03:04.050> like

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
push forward and lift in the front like

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.050 
push forward and lift in the front like
this<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.430> side<00:03:05.670> back<00:03:06.270> side<00:03:06.630> lift<00:03:07.620> by<00:03:08.310> back

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
this so it's side back side lift by back

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.770 
this so it's side back side lift by back
side<00:03:09.750> lift<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:11.460> course<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.270> get<00:03:12.420> these<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.660> look

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
side lift of course to get these to look

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.270 
side lift of course to get these to look
like<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.960> nice<00:03:13.170> -<00:03:13.410> well<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.710> gotta<00:03:13.860> cut<00:03:14.070> speed

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
like a nice - well you gotta cut speed

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.010 
like a nice - well you gotta cut speed
it<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.580> lot<00:03:14.700> away<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.180> make<00:03:15.690> sure<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
it up a lot away and make sure that the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.980 
it up a lot away and make sure that the
speed<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.890> same<00:03:17.240> throughout<00:03:18.240> all<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
speed is the same throughout all the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.030 
speed is the same throughout all the
different<00:03:19.320> moves<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.770> want<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.980> go

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
different moves you don't want to go

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.560 
different moves you don't want to go
faster<00:03:20.400> than<00:03:20.520> one<00:03:20.640> side<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.150> slow<00:03:21.450> in

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
faster than one side in and slow in

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.020 
faster than one side in and slow in
another<00:03:21.810> side<00:03:22.080> okay<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.010> side<00:03:23.640> back<00:03:24.000> side

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
another side okay so side back side

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.140 
another side okay so side back side
front<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.040> those<00:03:26.190> circles<00:03:26.640> that

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
front this is one of those circles that

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.390 
front this is one of those circles that
could<00:03:27.420> be<00:03:27.570> actually<00:03:28.050> done<00:03:28.290> very<00:03:28.590> slowly<00:03:28.860> just

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
could be actually done very slowly just

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.670 
could be actually done very slowly just
like<00:03:29.520> I'm<00:03:29.640> doing<00:03:29.910> right<00:03:30.030> now<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.530> can

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
like I'm doing right now but you can

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.270 
like I'm doing right now but you can
also<00:03:32.450> speed<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.570> up<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:34.710> when<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:34.950> speed<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
also speed it up and when you speed it

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.940 
also speed it up and when you speed it
up<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.730> looks<00:03:35.880> almost<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:37.260> tahitian

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
up it looks almost like the tahitian

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.950 
up it looks almost like the tahitian
circle<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.120> think<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.540> technique<00:03:39.870> is

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
circle and I think that the technique is

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.420 
circle and I think that the technique is
exactly<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.440> same<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.800> course<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.250> -<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
exactly the same of course is it - you

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.280 
exactly the same of course is it - you
should<00:03:41.610> circle<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.810> know<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.080> don't

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
should circle but you know just don't

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.690 
should circle but you know just don't
see<00:03:43.470> like<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:43.740> those<00:03:43.860> crazy<00:03:44.100> things<00:03:44.250> going<00:03:44.610> on

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
see like all those crazy things going on

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700 
see like all those crazy things going on
your<00:03:44.850> hair<00:03:44.970> segmentation<00:03:45.690> answers<00:03:46.050> so

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
your hair segmentation answers so

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.010 
your hair segmentation answers so
anyways<00:03:47.550> that's<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.180> mystic<00:03:48.510> technique<00:03:48.900> an

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
anyways that's the mystic technique an

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.490 
anyways that's the mystic technique an
idea<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.560> what<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.040> call<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.730> interior<00:03:51.180> hip

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
idea of what you call the interior hip

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.590 
idea of what you call the interior hip
circle<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.920> what<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.430> called<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:54.030> small<00:03:54.300> hip

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
circle and what I called this small hip

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.650 
circle and what I called this small hip
circle<00:03:55.380> okay<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.700> hopefully<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.330> answers

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
circle okay so hopefully that answers

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
circle okay so hopefully that answers
your<00:03:57.720> question<00:03:57.810> I'll<00:03:58.260> see<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> guys<00:03:58.620> next
