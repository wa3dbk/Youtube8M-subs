sticking with the TouchWiz ROM now this
ROM<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> pretty<00:01:00.149> cool<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:01.230> comes<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:02.340> a

ROM is pretty cool it comes with a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
ROM is pretty cool it comes with a
custom<00:01:02.850> kernel<00:01:03.359> also<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.170> actually

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
custom kernel also you can actually

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.850 
custom kernel also you can actually
overclock<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.200> tesla<00:01:07.680> rom

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
overclock it and this is the tesla rom

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.300 
overclock it and this is the tesla rom

it<00:01:15.180> does<00:01:15.479> come<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.080> kernel<00:01:16.530> auditor

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it does come with this kernel auditor

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.770 
it does come with this kernel auditor
program<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.000> ahead<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> run<00:01:18.570> this

and change your maximum frequency from

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
and change your maximum frequency from
two<00:01:26.220> point<00:01:26.549> two<00:01:26.850> six<00:01:27.060> five<00:01:27.299> dots<00:01:27.600> default<00:01:28.229> you

two point two six five dots default you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
two point two six five dots default you
can<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.650> all<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.860> way<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> two<00:01:29.340> point<00:01:29.610> seven

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
can go all the way up to two point seven

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
can go all the way up to two point seven
to<00:01:30.150> six<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.549> as

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to six that's I how I have it here as

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.109 
to six that's I how I have it here as
you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.960> will<00:01:34.170> allow<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
you can see here this will allow you to

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
you can see here this will allow you to
overclock<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.740> lot<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.220> faster

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
overclock and get a lot more faster

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600 
overclock and get a lot more faster
performance<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.720> antutu<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.380> scored<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
performance on antutu I scored about I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
performance on antutu I scored about I
think<00:01:42.030> forty<00:01:42.270> five<00:01:42.390> thousand<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.829> clock

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
think forty five thousand on that clock

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
think forty five thousand on that clock
so<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> huge<00:01:46.049> improvement<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.710> if

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
so it's not a huge improvement but if

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.170 
so it's not a huge improvement but if
you<00:01:46.920> play<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> lot<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> games<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.759> could<00:01:47.970> help

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
you play a lot of games it could help

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.690 
you play a lot of games it could help
but<00:01:49.020> without<00:01:49.380> overclocking<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.250> faster

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
but without overclocking it's faster

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.429 
but without overclocking it's faster
already<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:52.020> absolutely<00:01:52.200> need

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
already so if you don't absolutely need

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.060 
already so if you don't absolutely need
it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
it
I<00:01:53.100> suggest<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.450> leaving<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.899> on

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I suggest actually just leaving it on

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.620 
I suggest actually just leaving it on
without<00:01:55.710> overclocking<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.329> far<00:01:57.570> as

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
without overclocking now as far as

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.499 
without overclocking now as far as

it's got some excellent battery life and
if<00:03:55.769> you're<00:03:55.890> looking<00:03:56.010> for<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.370> good<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.700> OSP<00:03:57.000> ROM<00:03:57.180> I

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
if you're looking for a good a OSP ROM I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.660 
if you're looking for a good a OSP ROM I
mean<00:03:57.810> there's<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.110> ton<00:03:58.200> out<00:03:58.739> right<00:03:59.070> now<00:03:59.250> they're

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
mean there's a ton out right now they're

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.810 
mean there's a ton out right now they're
all<00:03:59.940> very<00:04:00.570> very<00:04:00.810> similar<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:02.519> I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
all very very similar but this one I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.520 
all very very similar but this one I
think<00:04:02.910> it's<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.420> little<00:04:03.660> bit<00:04:03.780> more<00:04:04.019> geared
