00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:24.750 
I'm going to bring the clever klore up
so<00:02:12.440> we're<00:02:12.590> sort<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.860> guesstimate<00:02:13.460> height

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.190 

now<00:02:25.760> if<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.240> pole<00:02:26.450> isn't<00:02:26.810> at<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.960> right

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
now if the pole isn't at the right

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660 
now if the pole isn't at the right
height<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> tip<00:02:28.430> just

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
height because you want the tip just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.230 
height because you want the tip just
above<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.030> water<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:30.680> hole<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.970> height

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.650 

there<00:02:35.980> lock<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.130> off<00:02:37.280> again<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.540> that's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
there lock it off again that's it that's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.410 
there lock it off again that's it that's
the<00:02:41.780> clever<00:02:42.020> claw<00:02:42.320> setup<00:02:42.910> I'm<00:02:43.910> now<00:02:44.120> going<00:02:44.330> to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
the clever claw setup I'm now going to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.600 
the clever claw setup I'm now going to
open<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.720> big<00:02:44.900> hand<00:02:45.170> wheel<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.709> tighten<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
open the big hand wheel and tighten it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.210 
open the big hand wheel and tighten it
fully<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> stop<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.709> claw<00:02:48.950> can

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
fully to the stop so that the claw can

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.360 
fully to the stop so that the claw can
operate<00:02:49.700> properly<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.840> there<00:02:50.990> you<00:02:51.140> are

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
operate properly and there you are

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.560 
operate properly and there you are
totally<00:02:52.370> hands-free<00:02:55.840> catapult<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:59.330> fire

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
totally hands-free catapult can fire

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.820 
totally hands-free catapult can fire
paint<00:02:59.959> much<00:03:00.230> easier<00:03:01.900> pick<00:03:02.900> some<00:03:03.080> bait<00:03:03.290> out<00:03:03.590> to

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
paint much easier pick some bait out to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.350 
paint much easier pick some bait out to
