and of course crossfire you get your
little<00:03:02.709> crossfire<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.799> fish<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.579> also<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.900> DVI

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
little crossfire to fish and also a DVI

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.690 
little crossfire to fish and also a DVI
to<00:03:07.159> vga<00:03:07.909> adapter<00:03:09.219> so<00:03:10.219> that's<00:03:10.400> pretty<00:03:10.639> much

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
to vga adapter so that's pretty much

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.979 
to vga adapter so that's pretty much
everything<00:03:10.939> you<00:03:11.299> get<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.629> box<00:03:11.659> there<00:03:13.989> i'll

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
everything you get in the box there i'll

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.869 
everything you get in the box there i'll
go<00:03:15.200> ahead<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.409> show<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.010> card<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.609> the

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
go ahead and show you the card in the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.199 
go ahead and show you the card in the
system<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.659> get<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> little<00:03:18.049> bit<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.169> an<00:03:18.349> idea

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
system you get a little bit of an idea

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:32.380 
system you get a little bit of an idea
how<00:03:20.209> big<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.659> is<00:03:20.719> things<00:03:21.169> like<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:22.719> alrighty

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.220 

way<00:03:33.390> about<00:03:33.630> that

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
way about that

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.260 
way about that
alright<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.530> here's<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.920> car<00:03:37.160> inside<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.120> my

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
alright so here's the car inside of my

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.240 
alright so here's the car inside of my
computer<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:41.569> you<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:41.930> see<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.220> a

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
computer and as you can see it is a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.600 
computer and as you can see it is a
pretty<00:03:43.670> big<00:03:43.940> card<00:03:44.739> I'm<00:03:45.739> sure<00:03:46.040> how<00:03:46.220> well<00:03:46.459> you

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
pretty big card I'm sure how well you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.220 
pretty big card I'm sure how well you
can<00:03:46.790> see<00:03:46.849> that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
can see that

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.190 
can see that
that<00:03:49.230> is

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.309 

your<00:03:55.590> mom<00:03:55.800> Rosie

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.649 

slide<00:04:03.099> down<00:04:03.129> how<00:04:03.730> we<00:04:03.790> can't<00:04:04.090> hear<00:04:04.299> me<00:04:04.450> very

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
slide down how we can't hear me very

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.800 
slide down how we can't hear me very
well<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.950> then<00:04:06.609> i<00:04:06.700> got<00:04:06.879> these<00:04:07.030> straight<00:04:07.389> six

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
well and then i got these straight six

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.860 
well and then i got these straight six
and<00:04:08.049> eight<00:04:08.170> pins<00:04:08.909> going<00:04:09.909> into<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.329> side<00:04:10.569> here

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
and eight pins going into the side here

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.780 
and eight pins going into the side here
it<00:04:11.859> does<00:04:12.040> take<00:04:12.280> two<00:04:12.609> of<00:04:12.639> them<00:04:13.030> there<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.359> it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
it does take two of them there in it

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.250 
it does take two of them there in it
that<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:15.819> cross<00:04:16.180> my<00:04:16.449> bridge<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.989> right

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
that you cross my bridge is right

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:30.640 
that you cross my bridge is right
and<00:04:19.260> on<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.580> back<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.330> get<00:04:22.790> believe<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.300> a

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.890 

couple<00:04:31.650> other<00:04:31.770> points<00:04:32.420> back<00:04:33.420> there<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.870> I

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
couple other points back there that I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.510 
couple other points back there that I
really<00:04:34.260> can't<00:04:34.830> see<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.370> well<00:04:36.950> okay<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.160> get

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
really can't see that well okay you get

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.970 
really can't see that well okay you get
your<00:04:38.700> dual<00:04:38.880> DVI<00:04:39.210> support<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.290> pretty<00:04:40.770> much<00:04:40.830> a

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
your dual DVI support and pretty much a

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.500 
your dual DVI support and pretty much a
bunch<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.370> different<00:04:41.670> options<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.060> go<00:04:42.240> with<00:04:42.390> I

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
bunch of different options to go with I

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.600 
bunch of different options to go with I
did<00:04:42.690> notice<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.080> doesn't<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.620> vga<00:04:43.950> output

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
did notice it doesn't have a vga output

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.660 
did notice it doesn't have a vga output
on<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.440> guess<00:04:46.740> that's<00:04:46.980> what<00:04:47.430> the

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
on it but I guess that's what the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.470 
on it but I guess that's what the
adapter<00:04:48.450> those<00:04:48.600> for<00:04:50.000> anyways<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.180> do<00:04:51.240> actually

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
adapter those for anyways I do actually

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.280 
adapter those for anyways I do actually
have<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:54.440> Unreal<00:04:56.510> not<00:04:57.510> I'm<00:04:57.720> your<00:04:57.930> birthing

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
have the Unreal not I'm your birthing
