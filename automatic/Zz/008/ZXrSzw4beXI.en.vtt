here<00:00:26.769> none<00:00:27.009> of<00:00:27.039> these<00:00:27.220> buttons<00:00:27.490> will<00:00:27.759> actually

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
here none of these buttons will actually

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.029 
here none of these buttons will actually
let<00:00:28.509> you<00:00:28.660> just<00:00:28.839> press<00:00:29.109> to<00:00:29.410> speed<00:00:29.679> up<00:00:29.830> or<00:00:29.980> slow

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
let you just press to speed up or slow

down<00:00:30.339> temporarily<00:00:31.060> it's<00:00:31.300> all<00:00:31.419> controlled<00:00:31.720> by

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
down temporarily it's all controlled by

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.560 
down temporarily it's all controlled by
this<00:00:32.200> outer<00:00:32.890> ring<00:00:33.610> with<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> little<00:00:33.850> circles<00:00:34.450> on

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
this outer ring with a little circles on

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.160 
this outer ring with a little circles on
it<00:00:34.600> okay<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.490> put<00:00:36.910> my<00:00:36.969> foot<00:00:37.270> just<00:00:37.510> spin<00:00:38.140> it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
it okay if I put my foot just spin it

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.200 
it okay if I put my foot just spin it
backwards<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:42.430> what<00:00:42.550> happens<00:00:42.820> it's<00:00:42.940> just<00:00:43.120> it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
backwards see what happens it's just it

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.880 
backwards see what happens it's just it
slows<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.420> down<00:00:43.539> and<00:00:43.899> if<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:44.020> go<00:00:44.140> boards<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.770> it's

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
slows it down and if I go boards so it's

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.170 
slows it down and if I go boards so it's
just<00:00:48.039> exactly<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.399> same<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:48.820> this<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.059> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
just exactly the same so this is the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.150 
just exactly the same so this is the
equivalent<00:00:49.660> of<00:00:49.930> hitting<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.920> pitch

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
equivalent of hitting that the pitch

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.540 
equivalent of hitting that the pitch
Bend<00:00:51.460> minus<00:00:52.030> button<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.719> go<00:00:53.399> okay<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.489> I

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
Bend minus button is to go okay and I

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.990 
Bend minus button is to go okay and I
can<00:00:54.670> go<00:00:54.789> I<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:57.039> run<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.370> with<00:00:57.489> my<00:00:57.609> finger<00:00:57.879> all

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
can go I can run it with my finger all

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.700 
can go I can run it with my finger all
the<00:00:58.030> way<00:00:58.120> around<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.539> I'll<00:00:58.600> temporarily<00:00:59.079> play

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
the way around and I'll temporarily play

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.689 
the way around and I'll temporarily play
a<00:00:59.739> much<00:01:00.309> slower<00:01:00.550> speed<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.750> again<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.699> lot

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
a much slower speed and again a lot

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.510 
a much slower speed and again a lot
faster<00:01:03.910> if<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.239> go<00:01:04.360> around<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:05.350> way<00:01:05.520> don't

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
faster if I go around that way don't

faster if I go around that way don't
confuse<00:01:06.730> this<00:01:06.970> with<00:01:07.150> trying<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:07.720> in<00:01:07.840> the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
confuse this with trying to do in the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.420 
confuse this with trying to do in the
center<00:01:08.260> bar<00:01:08.410> because<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:08.950> hold<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:09.280> to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
center bar because if you hold on to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.850 
center bar because if you hold on to
this<00:01:09.549> they're<00:01:10.150> gonna<00:01:10.270> do<00:01:10.750> Matt<00:01:11.229> part<00:01:11.619> in<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
this they're gonna do Matt part in the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.070 
this they're gonna do Matt part in the
middle<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.549> try<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.119> do<00:01:13.210> it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
middle and try and do it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.480 
middle and try and do it
it<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.290> makes<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> turn<00:01:16.680> into<00:01:16.799> scratch<00:01:17.189> more

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it just makes it turn into scratch more

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
it just makes it turn into scratch more
than<00:01:17.580> serious<00:01:17.729> trouble<00:01:18.590> okay<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:19.979> not

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
than serious trouble okay so it's not

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.990 
than serious trouble okay so it's not
the<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> did<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> our<00:01:21.000> site

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.630 

that's<00:01:26.660> what<00:01:26.780> happens<00:01:27.080> Baltimore
