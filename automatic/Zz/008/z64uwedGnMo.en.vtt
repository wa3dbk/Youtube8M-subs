00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
the baseball's there's actually a couple

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.620 
the baseball's there's actually a couple
sports<00:02:52.260> items<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:52.800> game<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.640> far<00:02:53.940> there's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
sports items in this game so far there's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.090 
sports items in this game so far there's
soccer<00:02:54.870> balls<00:02:55.230> which<00:02:55.440> are<00:02:55.560> actually<00:02:55.740> bombs

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
soccer balls which are actually bombs

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.280 
soccer balls which are actually bombs
and<00:02:57.030> then<00:02:57.210> there's<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> baseball<00:02:57.690> which<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and then there's the baseball which I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.320 
and then there's the baseball which I
think<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.950> level<00:02:59.460> actually<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.970> its<00:03:00.150> first

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
think this level actually is its first

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.800 
think this level actually is its first
appearance<00:03:00.540> I've<00:03:01.050> seen<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.470> couple<00:03:01.800> times

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
appearance I've seen it a couple times

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.760 
appearance I've seen it a couple times
once<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.050> baseball<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.709> throw

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
once you have the baseball you can throw

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.340 
once you have the baseball you can throw
it<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.070> an<00:03:05.130> enemy's<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.970> fireball<00:03:06.840> which

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
it at an enemy's like a fireball which

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.460 
it at an enemy's like a fireball which
is<00:03:07.530> cool<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:08.670> then<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.840> accidentally

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
is cool but then I kind of accidentally

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.900 
is cool but then I kind of accidentally
figured<00:03:10.830> something<00:03:11.010> out<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.520> thing<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
figured something out with this thing I

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.020 
figured something out with this thing I
guess<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.360> can<00:03:12.510> use<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.930> baseball<00:03:13.380> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
guess you can use the baseball to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.280 
guess you can use the baseball to
activate<00:03:15.030> stuff<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.660> environment<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
activate stuff in the environment so you

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
activate stuff in the environment so you

makes<00:03:20.459> no<00:03:20.550> sense<00:03:20.910> maybe<00:03:21.540> maybe<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.170> does<00:03:22.290> make

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
makes no sense maybe maybe it does make

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.330 
makes no sense maybe maybe it does make
sense<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.830> don't<00:03:23.010> know

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
that difficulty really isn't that high

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.970 
that difficulty really isn't that high

the<00:03:42.200> gamepad<00:03:42.470> that's<00:03:42.950> hilarious<00:03:43.370> table<00:03:44.020> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
the gamepad that's hilarious table the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.930 
the gamepad that's hilarious table the
difficulty<00:03:45.560> curve<00:03:45.680> really<00:03:46.040> isn't<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.370> steep

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
difficulty curve really isn't that steep

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.300 
difficulty curve really isn't that steep
so<00:03:47.390> it's<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:47.870> far<00:03:48.140> it's<00:03:48.290> been<00:03:48.380> pretty<00:03:48.440> easy<00:03:49.040> but

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
so it's so far it's been pretty easy but

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.860 
so it's so far it's been pretty easy but
that<00:03:49.490> might<00:03:49.670> change<00:03:49.700> dramatically<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.690> end

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
that might change dramatically the end

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.720 
that might change dramatically the end
of<00:03:50.990> super<00:03:51.230> mario<00:03:51.350> 3d<00:03:51.740> land<00:03:51.830> on<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.160> 3ds<00:03:52.490> got
