00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 we lost but the smith in your house 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.090
 understood that you can not relax 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 someone team 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.820
 castration need to play the game all the more 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.660
 This team lost to bend over. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.230
 target row home game I again what 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 according to my fans stole so 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.669
 important it was tragically permeating but i 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 I think the teams played the most requested from 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:43.410
 them completely the whole match with full 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.300
 concentration congratulations on winning muddle 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 in our game who want to reconfigure 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.190
 the guys really wanted therefore 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.489
 muddled some kind of incomprehensible game 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.170
 unorganized attack with all 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 respect for soviet how they won 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 how deserved but still to me 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.789
 it seems at first here is the removal when 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.439
 the judge raised his hand a minute then played 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.939
 deletion seems from another to another 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.810
 the team was first and here it is 221 at 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:18.570
 account wholly poured four 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:21.000
 key hammer us right here here 4 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 judges must see how a person plays 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 two millimeters are not dislodged by the eye you 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.340
 eyes tie someone about currency 4 they are so our 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.229
 nonmagic how do you think how much 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.130
 today's match was very different from that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.310
 game which was in Moscow but of course 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 I am glad about the program that I missed the victory 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 not very good dollar reps 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 translating this today were more ready 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 did not allow the opponent to realize the moments and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.210
 in general, as you generally Novokuznetsk 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.460
 the team would be interested to hear your 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.509
 opinion about the club that has the most 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.159
 low budget in chl 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.460
 i live 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.280
 this one never discuss nothing i am 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.220
 the player that I will discuss the same as 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.519
 and I hockey players you do not hand over correctly 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.519
