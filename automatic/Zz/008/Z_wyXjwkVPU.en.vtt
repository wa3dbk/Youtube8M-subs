00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
what I expect for myself to do next area

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.560 
what I expect for myself to do next area
right<00:03:41.980> how<00:03:42.980> tough<00:03:43.220> was<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.430> simply<00:03:43.760> from<00:03:43.970> from

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
right how tough was it simply from from

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.509 
right how tough was it simply from from
an<00:03:44.690> offense<00:03:45.140> perspective<00:03:45.890> spending<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.400> much

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
an offense perspective spending so much

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.590 
an offense perspective spending so much
time<00:03:46.549> on<00:03:46.940> defense<00:03:47.390> from<00:03:47.630> day<00:03:47.810> one<00:03:48.080> was<00:03:48.320> there

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
time on defense from day one was there

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.330 
time on defense from day one was there
it<00:03:50.600> was<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.900> was<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> tough<00:03:51.470> transition<00:03:51.860> early

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
it was it was a tough transition early

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.789 
it was it was a tough transition early
on<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.880> play<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.930> offense<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.530> you've<00:03:54.620> been

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
on to play that offense that you've been

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.650 
on to play that offense that you've been
used<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.100> of<00:03:55.580> course<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:56.030> tough<00:03:56.239> but<00:03:56.540> that's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
used to of course it's tough but that's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.759 
used to of course it's tough but that's
what<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:56.959> takes<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:57.350> win

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
what it takes to win

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.770 
what it takes to win
reading<00:03:58.459> one<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.850> here<00:03:59.030> but<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.239> know<00:03:59.360> coach<00:03:59.630> is

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
reading one is here but I know coach is

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.270 
reading one is here but I know coach is
coming<00:04:00.080> from<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.320> winning<00:04:00.560> situation<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.250> he

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
coming from a winning situation so he

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.160 
coming from a winning situation so he
definitely<00:04:01.760> knows<00:04:01.910> what<00:04:01.970> what<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.840> takes<00:04:03.019> to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
definitely knows what what it takes to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.960 
definitely knows what what it takes to
win<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:03.950> that's<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.280> right<00:04:04.400> way<00:04:04.640> it's<00:04:04.820> not

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
win so that's the right way it's not

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.890 
win so that's the right way it's not
easy<00:04:05.150> otherwise<00:04:05.780> everybody<00:04:06.320> would<00:04:06.380> do<00:04:06.650> it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.920

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
the playoffs next year I think for sure

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.890 
the playoffs next year I think for sure
the<00:04:34.340> first<00:04:34.550> thing<00:04:34.640> is<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> little<00:04:35.150> bit<00:04:35.270> of

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
the first thing is a little bit of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.900 
the first thing is a little bit of
experience<00:04:36.500> more<00:04:37.100> than<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:37.430> year<00:04:37.640> we<00:04:37.760> had<00:04:37.880> a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
experience more than this year we had a

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.580 
experience more than this year we had a
very<00:04:38.240> young<00:04:38.390> team<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:39.140> would<00:04:39.290> come<00:04:39.470> you

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
very young team so that would come you

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.870 
very young team so that would come you
know<00:04:39.680> from<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.070> mistakes<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.580> we've<00:04:40.730> done

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
know from the mistakes that we've done

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.550 
know from the mistakes that we've done
this<00:04:41.030> year<00:04:41.270> because<00:04:41.420> we<00:04:42.080> played<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.350> lot<00:04:42.500> of

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
this year because we played a lot of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.870 
this year because we played a lot of
games<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.980> were<00:04:43.070> very<00:04:43.310> tight<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.790> know

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
games that were very tight you know

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.820 
games that were very tight you know
until<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.300> end<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.600> most<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.440> them<00:04:45.560> we<00:04:45.680> lost

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
until the end and most of them we lost

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.770 
until the end and most of them we lost
them<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.000> think<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.360> got<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.570> learn<00:04:47.720> from

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
them so I think we got to learn from

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.860 
them so I think we got to learn from
those<00:04:48.170> kind<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.470> games<00:04:48.650> right<00:04:49.780> that's<00:04:50.780> the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
those kind of games right that's the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.650 
those kind of games right that's the
first<00:04:51.110> thing<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:54.710> can<00:04:55.610> say<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:55.880> still<00:04:56.270> gotta<00:04:56.480> sit

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
first thing I can say I still gotta sit

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.630 
first thing I can say I still gotta sit
down<00:04:56.810> with<00:04:56.960> with<00:04:57.620> Bryan<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.220> medical

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
down with with Bryan and the medical

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.490 
down with with Bryan and the medical
stuff<00:04:58.850> you<00:04:59.060> know<00:04:59.180> because<00:04:59.540> for<00:04:59.570> my<00:04:59.870> injury<00:05:00.230> so

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
stuff you know because for my injury so

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.290 
stuff you know because for my injury so
we<00:05:00.800> still<00:05:01.070> gotta<00:05:01.280> decide<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:01.820> know<00:05:01.910> what<00:05:02.090> was

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
we still gotta decide you know what was

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:11.830 
we still gotta decide you know what was
the<00:05:02.450> plan<00:05:07.030> I<00:05:09.580> don't<00:05:10.580> know<00:05:10.640> we<00:05:11.360> need<00:05:11.480> more

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
the plan I don't know we need more

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.530 
the plan I don't know we need more
experience<00:05:12.230> but<00:05:12.710> that's<00:05:13.160> that's<00:05:13.370> Bryan<00:05:13.850> job

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.550 

how<00:05:20.540> different<00:05:20.930> is<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.110> feeling<00:05:21.380> at<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.530> end

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
how different is the feeling at the end

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.020 
how different is the feeling at the end
of<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.830> season<00:05:22.160> as<00:05:22.250> opposed<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:22.640> last<00:05:23.030> year

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
of the season as opposed to last year

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.270 
of the season as opposed to last year
well<00:05:26.169> result<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.440> same<00:05:27.470> but<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:27.890> think<00:05:28.160> we

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
well result is the same but I think we

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.730 
well result is the same but I think we
did<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.540> rocky<00:05:29.540> I<00:05:29.750> did<00:05:29.930> with<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.080> really<00:05:30.350> good<00:05:30.500> job
