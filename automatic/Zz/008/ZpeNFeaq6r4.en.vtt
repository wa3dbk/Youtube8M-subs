00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
probably the only letdown in the system

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
probably the only letdown in the system
it's<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.039> very<00:02:02.280> cheap<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.939> tacky<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it's just very cheap and tacky but it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.599 
it's just very cheap and tacky but it
does<00:02:03.749> do<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.109> job<00:02:04.140> we've<00:02:04.950> got<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.369> sort
