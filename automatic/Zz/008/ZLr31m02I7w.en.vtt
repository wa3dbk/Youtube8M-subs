 then already in depth giving some 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.599
 craft workshops and best super 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.190
 excellent because people always 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.379
 recognizes through the videos true 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 that are seen here in the channel and they see us 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.610
 through youtube good today we're going to 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.730
 be elaborating what is called 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.800
 thermoformed with these pieces that are 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.300
 some molds for thermoforming we are going to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
 have working ornaments for trees 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.130
 Christmas there we have the good decorations 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.280
 we have today we are going to make ornaments 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.329
 Christmas with thermoforming molds 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.000
 we are going to have the materials that are 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.450
 molds for thermoforming clean pipes 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.600
 silicon golden thread coming scissors and 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.090
 griddle 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.400
 it's perfect good here we have the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.049
 different the different samples of what 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.049
 what can they do with all the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.840
 tools that I'm going to 4 mention and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.880
 something me in there that's a bit before 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 start that with this method and it's 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.890
 extremely easy against the camera as 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.600
 one that one with minutes make one like that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.490
 as a minute do each mold of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 thermoformed for example here we can 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 to present the pieces for example here 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.899
 we have this that is a true sphere 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.010
 for Christmas trees there is also 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.590
 excellent to hang on the walls 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.590
 from the ceiling you can see it there 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.330
 composed of a lot of 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 flowers and you can see they have volume 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.380
 everything has been made with a mold of 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.170
 thermoformed here we can also 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.900
 observe that we have a butterfly 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.250
 then a two- layer stand too 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.290
 we have here that what we are going to do to 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.520
 continuation 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.650
 we also have good we are going to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.060
 presenting the molds and the molds 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800
 can be found in bookstores already 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.630
 they know that bookstores can find 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.720
 all that is thermoforming mold in 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.210
 this case I have a bell too 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.010
 we have ties in this case I have here the 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.590
 opposite party to make the tie that the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.390
 mold that will normally be left 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.150
 there are also butterflies here I have a 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.280
 small and there are also the size 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.390
 great that what I have was here 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.130
 you can always find it even in the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.510
 bookstore and fashion is much truth 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.120
 because what they did was 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.920
 work everything based on heat and how 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.450
 You always have to know that a lot of heat 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.680
 in our hands we can also produce 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.930
 art cysts then this is going to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.130
 help make our work easier and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.930
 Besides that, it will also prevent us 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.370
 a future arthritis 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.080
 we also have to be very careful 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.910
 when handling the plates 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.410
 so we are going to teach you how to do it 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.120
 also these molds can 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.500
 serve to make candles you can 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.420
 serve as a mold to make candela 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.580
 It can also serve as a mold 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.170
 to make cold porcelain here it's just going to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.940
 put the cold porcelain going to 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.340
 press immediately just going to 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.020
 unmold another way obviously you 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.210
 we have to put a little bit of Vaseline 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.460
 simple so that I will not stick in the 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.260
 mold another of many segments we 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.420
 to leave details how to make chains 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 also soaps can also do it 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.120
 they can use as gelatin says the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.550
 bald around here and 20 times good at the time 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.290
 then good hands to the work first 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.530
 we have to have our mold that goes to 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.570
 be the one who is here in reverse truth I 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.670
 I always tell him reverse relief and already 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.790
 we have the comic book let's put this 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.680
 color and then we're going to cut it a 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.410
 little bit bigger that is what it has 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.020
 the size of the mold I'm going to place in 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.270
 this case that I have here the frost 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.280
 to the opposite direction where normally 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.290
 I'm going to have the mold and here we do have 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.660
 have the maximum heat plate here 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.360
 I have the iron at maximum heat and 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.440
 let's put it approximately 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.460
 in 18 to 20 seconds it's going to heat 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.920
 completely 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.100
 we have to be putting little by little and 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.870
 I can put it then it's not going 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.120
 going up and up to see if 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.390
 maybe it's going to hit but like that when 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.920
 we do so calculated then already already 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.990
 we already know when it will be 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.120
 completely hot that's so that 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.060
 I'm going to soften it, because 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.790
 it usually comes like this very dense then 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.480
 to soften a little the fomín 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.519
 immediately what I'm going to do is 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.100
 place the opposite party that the 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.640
 had relief and I'm going to press on this 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.200
 we have to put pressure on time 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.130
 we make the pressure of all the corners 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.720
 about five to ten seconds true 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.400
 so that it is totally then 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.440
 thermoformed means that it's going to 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.480
 keep the heat there when we are 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.910
 pressing and as how each of the 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.230
 pieces are cold immediately going to 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.450
 cool the one that is hot that is going to 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.130
 be the fomín here they can observe in their 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.410
 screens that will immediately come out 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.449
 Our piece is perfect for decorating 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.999
 for the trees themselves 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:05:01.229
 and then just what we're going to do 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:05:03.629
 is to cut the piece for our son and 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.849
 so they also sit in 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.520
 part of what is the decoration of the 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.620
 Christmas of your house yes they can also 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.839
 work it as you say with children 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.879
 but obviously if they are too young 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.169
 you can not put them to work with the 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.569
 iron because obviously you can 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.150
 burn then for stick or mom 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.039
 you can go working really molds and 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.839
 equally children can go cutting 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.060
 and they are going to be part of the anses 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.090
 only for adults iron for 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.190
 the adults 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.630
 then that's how easy it is to be 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.960
 mold I can simply do 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.900
 place there the pipes that can be cleaned 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.240
 make more smell or in metallic colors 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.430
 because obviously it's always fashionable 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.980
 100 in life use this kind of 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.660
 tone and always right now you can 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.240
 observe I'm using colors like 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.280
 the magenta colors like the blue 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.600
 electric here we have a very green 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.190
 clear because that is the fashion that comes 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.660
 right now for Christmas this kind of 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:02.010
 colors to take it for example here 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.630
 I have here the two pieces are going 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.830
 I have a clean fifa I am going to use a 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.740
 clean tea to be completely 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.920
 opposite to he placed the two thus 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.840
 tips pipe line going to join together the 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.480
 that a little bit I'm going to bend towards 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.970
 forward and then I'm going to start 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.170
 fold it one by one synthesizes it to 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.190
 that look like the antennas of the 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.840
 butterfly 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.930
 and the only thing that will happen next 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.940
 it's just going to be stuck in them 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.010
 I have here a golden thread that also 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.810
 the hanger will serve us then I will 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.440
 to cut an approximate next to 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.800
 night and we're going to stick with silicone 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.680
 hot then he folded the knot 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.210
 we make the knot I already have here the 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.070
 silicone gun then I'm going to put 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.910
 silicone 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.490
 here in the back 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.800
 and then I will place here in clean 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.849
 pipe 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.849
 then I place 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.800
 what is going to be our hanger 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.080
 immediately we are going to cover with another one of 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.699
 the butterflies with another one of the molds and 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.009
 we're going to have it here so I just 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:08.710
 I'm going to fold a little 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.809
 the one that is above so that it produces me 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.580
 a little volume and there we already have 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.580
 our butterfly for christmas tree 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.669
 if you could decorate your house with 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.990
 these kinds of materials can find 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:27.559
 in the bookstore and they can do it too 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.300
 with your hip hop children the more the better 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:31.189
 involve more the better family is going to 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.569
 be the work and everything we're going to 

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:35.839
 feel what is the decoration of 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:37.339
