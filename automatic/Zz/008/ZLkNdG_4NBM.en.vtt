hey guys welcome to Helio bytes comm
this<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.620> an<00:00:07.769> overview<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.730> basic

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
this is an overview of the basic

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.770 
this is an overview of the basic
four-stroke<00:00:10.430> 49cc<00:00:11.430> cruiser<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.390> we<00:00:12.570> offer

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
four-stroke 49cc cruiser that we offer

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.799 
four-stroke 49cc cruiser that we offer
as<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.340> see<00:00:14.519> there's<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.850> front<00:00:15.240> caliper

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
as you can see there's a front caliper

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.529 
as you can see there's a front caliper
break<00:00:16.080> attached<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.769> the<00:00:16.890> front<00:00:17.189> tire<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:18.180> well

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
break attached to the front tire as well

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.050 
break attached to the front tire as well
as<00:00:18.720> there's<00:00:19.019> a<00:00:19.109> rear<00:00:19.380> coaster<00:00:19.919> break<00:00:20.159> with

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
as there's a rear coaster break with

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.509 
as there's a rear coaster break with
just<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> beach<00:00:21.810> cruiser<00:00:22.249> you<00:00:23.249> can<00:00:23.400> see

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
just like a beach cruiser you can see

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.159 
just like a beach cruiser you can see
the<00:00:23.640> poles<00:00:23.880> started<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.329> the<00:00:24.480> four-strokes<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
the poles started up the four-strokes a

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.109 
the poles started up the four-strokes a
little<00:00:25.349> bit<00:00:25.470> different<00:00:25.890> than<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> two-stroke

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
little bit different than the two-stroke

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.300 
little bit different than the two-stroke
and<00:00:27.329> it<00:00:27.960> does<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.289> disadvantages<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and it does have disadvantages and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.060 
and it does have disadvantages and
advantages<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.210> advantages<00:00:30.239> first<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.560> or

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
advantages the advantages first off or

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.090 
advantages the advantages first off or
that<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> chain<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> ghost<00:00:34.590> door<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that the chain has a ghost door the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.500 
that the chain has a ghost door the
sprocket<00:00:35.670> goes<00:00:36.300> through<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.989> free<00:00:37.680> will<00:00:37.920> which

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
sprocket goes through a free will which

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.029 
sprocket goes through a free will which
basically<00:00:39.510> glides<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:40.800> bit<00:00:40.890> better

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
basically glides a little bit better

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.770 
basically glides a little bit better
than<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.429> two-stroke<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.090> doesn't<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
than your two-stroke it doesn't have the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 
than your two-stroke it doesn't have the
drag<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.859> two-stroke<00:00:44.340> does<00:00:44.609> so<00:00:45.269> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
drag like the two-stroke does so that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360 
drag like the two-stroke does so that
when<00:00:45.660> you're<00:00:45.809> neutral<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.250> bit

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
when you're neutral it's a little bit

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.340 
when you're neutral it's a little bit
easier<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.820> pedal<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.899> there's<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
easier to pedal because there's a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.450 
easier to pedal because there's a
free-will<00:00:49.649> attached<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.519> it<00:00:52.070> also<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
free-will attached to it also the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.119 
free-will attached to it also the
disadvantage<00:00:54.300> would<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.749> that<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.980> little

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
disadvantage would be that it's a little

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
disadvantage would be that it's a little
bit<00:00:56.339> wider<00:00:56.609> so<00:00:56.969> that's<00:00:57.359> why<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.019> use

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
bit wider so that's why we have to use

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.489 
bit wider so that's why we have to use
the<00:00:58.320> wide<00:00:58.559> pedal<00:00:58.980> kit<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.699> see<00:01:00.499> to

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
the wide pedal kit as you can see to

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.130 
the wide pedal kit as you can see to
clear<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.179> transmission<00:01:03.899> gearbox

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
clear all the the transmission gearbox

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.480 
clear all the the transmission gearbox
as<00:01:04.890> well<00:01:05.190> as<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.200> pull<00:01:07.200> starter<00:01:07.680> another

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
as well as the pull starter another

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.110 
as well as the pull starter another
advantage<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.650> Helio<00:01:10.650> bike<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
advantage of Helio bike is that we use a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.470 
advantage of Helio bike is that we use a
special<00:01:12.480> adapter<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:14.280> keeps<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.090> rear

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
special adapter that keeps the rear

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.740 
special adapter that keeps the rear
wheel<00:01:15.720> perfectly<00:01:16.590> concentric<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.750> there's

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
wheel perfectly concentric and there's

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
wheel perfectly concentric and there's
no<00:01:18.900> up-and-down<00:01:19.380> movement<00:01:20.010> which<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.430> great

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
no up-and-down movement which is great

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
no up-and-down movement which is great
it's<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.210> hard<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> pull<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
it's really hard to pull that off with a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640 
it's really hard to pull that off with a
rag<00:01:22.860> joint<00:01:23.250> type<00:01:23.730> of<00:01:24.000> setup<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.050> often<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
rag joint type of setup but often in the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
rag joint type of setup but often in the
kit<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> Helio<00:01:26.820> bike<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.720> get

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
kit so when you get a Helio bike you get

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.110 
kit so when you get a Helio bike you get
a<00:01:28.010> concentric<00:01:29.010> sprocket<00:01:29.610> which<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:29.910> very

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
a concentric sprocket which is very

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.540 
a concentric sprocket which is very
important<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> brake<00:01:32.070> control

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
important you see the brake control

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.350 
important you see the brake control
there<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:34.020> gas<00:01:34.380> tank<00:01:34.410> as<00:01:35.190> well<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.820> your

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
