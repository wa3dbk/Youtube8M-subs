competitive map feature today we're
looking<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.340> an<00:00:08.429> app<00:00:08.610> called<00:00:08.820> Akasha<00:00:09.360> by<00:00:09.870> a

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
looking at an app called Akasha by a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.410 
looking at an app called Akasha by a
chunk<00:00:10.530> not<00:00:11.160> sure<00:00:11.370> what<00:00:11.550> he<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> chunk<00:00:12.240> of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
chunk not sure what he is a chunk of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.570 
chunk not sure what he is a chunk of
hopefully<00:00:13.110> chocolate<00:00:13.590> not<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.070> poop<00:00:14.340> or

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hopefully chocolate not like poop or

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.330 
hopefully chocolate not like poop or
something<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.450> anyways<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.560> map<00:00:16.949> has<00:00:17.279> been

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
something but anyways this map has been

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.790 
something but anyways this map has been
around<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.510> quite<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:19.080> time<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.560> kind

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
around for quite some time and it's kind

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.310 
around for quite some time and it's kind
of<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.010> slipped<00:00:20.400> under<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:20.850> radar<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
of just slipped under my radar but it

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.300 
of just slipped under my radar but it
was<00:00:22.410> finally<00:00:22.830> brought<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.279> attention

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
was finally brought to my attention

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.820 
was finally brought to my attention
fairly<00:00:24.180> recently<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.050> wow<00:00:25.320> why

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
fairly recently and I was like wow why

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.980 
fairly recently and I was like wow why
have<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.340> seen<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.269> before<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> great

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
have I not seen this before it's a great

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.200 
have I not seen this before it's a great
map<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:29.240> Akasha<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:31.430> asymmetrical<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.759> v2<00:00:33.030> map

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
map so Akasha is asymmetrical to v2 map

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.020 
map so Akasha is asymmetrical to v2 map
which<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.809> largely<00:00:34.320> inspired<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.950> halo<00:00:35.610> cg's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
which is largely inspired by halo cg's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.940 
which is largely inspired by halo cg's
damnation<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:37.140> some<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.559> may<00:00:37.739> know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
damnation which some of you may know

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
damnation which some of you may know
better<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.910> penance<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.760> Halo<00:00:41.760> Reach<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
better as penance from Halo Reach on the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.119 
better as penance from Halo Reach on the
halo<00:00:43.440> anniversary<00:00:43.590> map<00:00:44.550> pack<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
halo anniversary map pack but it's it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
halo anniversary map pack but it's it
draws<00:00:47.399> several<00:00:48.030> similarities<00:00:48.390> from<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> map

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
draws several similarities from that map

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.819 
draws several similarities from that map
but<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.530> course<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.920> its<00:00:50.100> own<00:00:50.899> design<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
but of course is its own design and this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
but of course is its own design and this
map<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.010> built<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.640> erosion<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.660> also

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
map is built on erosion which is also

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
map is built on erosion which is also
something<00:00:55.350> rare<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:56.100> maps<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.640> I've

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
something rare for maps that I've

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.990 
something rare for maps that I've
featured<00:00:57.379> I'm<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.949> personally<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> huge<00:00:59.820> fan

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
featured I'm not personally a huge fan

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760 
featured I'm not personally a huge fan
of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> erosion<00:01:00.570> canvas<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.320> think<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of the erosion canvas but I think this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
of the erosion canvas but I think this
might<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.640> well<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.030> create

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
might use is it really well to create

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.609 
might use is it really well to create
that<00:01:03.449> kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> atmosphere<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that kind of atmosphere you got that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
that kind of atmosphere you got that
like<00:01:04.830> green<00:01:05.580> lake<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
like green lake going on it kind of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.740 
like green lake going on it kind of
harkens<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.750> underground

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
harkens back to that's a underground

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.370 
harkens back to that's a underground
cavern<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.010> saw<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.460> damnation<00:01:12.090> um<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
cavern that you saw on damnation um but

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.730 
cavern that you saw on damnation um but
this<00:01:13.890> map<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.580> great<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.150> far<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.840> how

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
this map is really great as far as how

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
this map is really great as far as how
it<00:01:16.890> plays<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> 2v2<00:01:17.820> map<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.330> very

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it plays as a 2v2 map it's very

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
it plays as a 2v2 map it's very
fast-paced<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> large<00:01:20.159> map<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
fast-paced it's not a large map and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
fast-paced it's not a large map and
there's<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> ton<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> hard<00:01:22.409> connections

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
there's not a ton of hard connections

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179 
there's not a ton of hard connections
around<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> map<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.700> um<00:01:24.500> it's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.710> very

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
around the map so um it's a very

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
around the map so um it's a very
movement<00:01:26.600> intensive<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
movement intensive you're not going to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
movement intensive you're not going to
be<00:01:28.320> sitting<00:01:28.590> anywhere<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.189> any<00:01:29.340> length<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
be sitting anywhere for any length of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.170 
be sitting anywhere for any length of
time<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.799> cool<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.970> got

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
time and it's cool because it's it's got

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.359 
time and it's cool because it's it's got
a<00:01:33.210> lot<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> verticality<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.890> there's<00:01:35.130> only

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
a lot of verticality but there's only

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
a lot of verticality but there's only
three<00:01:36.060> hard<00:01:36.420> routes<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> uppermost

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
three hard routes up to the uppermost

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490 
three hard routes up to the uppermost
level<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.140> super

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
level and one of those is the super

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
level and one of those is the super
exposed<00:01:40.979> pipe<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.780> um<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:43.979> those<00:01:44.159> hard

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
exposed pipe so um you know those hard

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.440 
exposed pipe so um you know those hard
routes<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.729> hard<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> come<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.149> kind

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
routes are you know hard to come by kind

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
routes are you know hard to come by kind
of<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.320> there's<00:01:49.500> these<00:01:49.649> other<00:01:49.860> routes

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of but then there's these other routes

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
of but then there's these other routes
um<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.090> I'll<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> minute

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
um and I'll get to that in a minute

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.179 
um and I'll get to that in a minute
first<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> talk<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> weapons

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
first I want to talk about the weapons

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.810 
first I want to talk about the weapons
on<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:54.030> map<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.619> neutral<00:01:56.460> sniper

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
on this map so there is a neutral sniper

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.410 
on this map so there is a neutral sniper
rifle<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.509> spawns<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.409> on

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
rifle which spawns kind of down on

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.330 
rifle which spawns kind of down on
on<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.780> platform<00:02:00.350> right<00:02:00.710> above<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.040> water

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
on the platform right above the water

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.160 
on the platform right above the water
down<00:02:01.700> at<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.939> foot<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.240> map<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.659> that's

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
down at the foot of the map and that's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.859 
down at the foot of the map and that's
the<00:02:03.470> only<00:02:03.530> real<00:02:04.250> power<00:02:04.880> weapon<00:02:05.299> on<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.720> map

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
the only real power weapon on the map

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.350 
the only real power weapon on the map
but<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.280> very<00:02:07.549> useful<00:02:07.790> weapon<00:02:08.119> but

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
but that is a very useful weapon but

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.029 
but that is a very useful weapon but
it's<00:02:08.509> also<00:02:08.630> pretty<00:02:08.929> difficult<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.590> use<00:02:09.770> on

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
it's also pretty difficult to use on

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.920 
it's also pretty difficult to use on
your<00:02:10.580> very<00:02:10.759> exposed<00:02:11.239> when<00:02:11.480> you're<00:02:11.599> getting

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
your very exposed when you're getting

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.830 
your very exposed when you're getting
that<00:02:12.080> weapon<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:13.000> given<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> nature<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.480> you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
that weapon and given the nature of you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.500 
that weapon and given the nature of you
know<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> map<00:02:15.200> being<00:02:15.410> kind<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> tight<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.510> you

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
know the map being kind of tight and you

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.970 
know the map being kind of tight and you
know<00:02:17.600> encouraging<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.319> move<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.800> lot

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
know encouraging you to move a lot

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.559 
know encouraging you to move a lot
you're<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.760> going<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.030> able<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.330> sit

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
you're not going to be able to just sit

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.240 
you're not going to be able to just sit
down<00:02:20.600> somewhere<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.170> snipe<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.709> it's<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.010> it's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
down somewhere and snipe so it's a it's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.920 
down somewhere and snipe so it's a it's
a<00:02:22.400> difficult<00:02:22.670> weapon<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.300> use<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.480> it's<00:02:23.750> very

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
a difficult weapon to use but it's very

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.790 
a difficult weapon to use but it's very
rewarding<00:02:24.519> um<00:02:25.519> there's<00:02:26.360> also<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.870> bolt<00:02:27.290> shot<00:02:27.590> on

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
rewarding um there's also a bolt shot on

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.280 
rewarding um there's also a bolt shot on
the<00:02:28.640> little<00:02:29.000> central<00:02:29.420> pipe<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.870> runs<00:02:30.050> up

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the little central pipe that runs up

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.979 
the little central pipe that runs up
from<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.769> sniper<00:02:31.099> platform<00:02:31.670> up<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
from that sniper platform up to the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.449 
from that sniper platform up to the
upper<00:02:33.110> level<00:02:33.470> than<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.010> bolt<00:02:34.220> shot

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
upper level than that and that bolt shot

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.880 
upper level than that and that bolt shot
is<00:02:34.730> not<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.600> be<00:02:35.720> underestimated<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.860> a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
is not to be underestimated that is a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.830 
is not to be underestimated that is a
very<00:02:37.160> useful<00:02:37.370> weapon<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.450> also<00:02:38.600> very

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
very useful weapon but it's also very

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.930 
very useful weapon but it's also very
difficult<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.470> use<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.799> have<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.640> know<00:02:40.700> be

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
difficult to use you have to you know be

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.509 
difficult to use you have to you know be
very<00:02:41.150> careful<00:02:41.569> with<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.810> time<00:02:42.019> your<00:02:42.170> shots<00:02:42.519> you

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
very careful with it time your shots you

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.759 
very careful with it time your shots you
know<00:02:43.549> there's<00:02:43.790> not<00:02:44.150> much<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.780> way<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.930> hard

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
know there's not much in the way of hard

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.559 
know there's not much in the way of hard
corners<00:02:46.430> around<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.880> map<00:02:47.030> someone's<00:02:47.390> like

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
corners around the map someone's like

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.600 
corners around the map someone's like
driving<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.590> motorcycle<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.280> background

driving a motorcycle and background
sorry<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:51.380> know<00:02:51.470> there's<00:02:51.650> not<00:02:51.769> these<00:02:51.980> like

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
sorry you know there's not these like

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.460 
sorry you know there's not these like
hard<00:02:52.430> corners<00:02:52.790> around<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.060> map<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.470> you're

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
hard corners around the map so you're

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.990 
hard corners around the map so you're
not<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.920> camp<00:02:55.160> around<00:02:55.430> corners<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:55.880> use

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
not going to camp around corners and use

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.910 
not going to camp around corners and use
bulshada<00:02:56.450> again<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.200> kind<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.440> difficulties

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
bulshada again it's kind of difficulties

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.039 
bulshada again it's kind of difficulties
then<00:02:58.640> there's<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> speed<00:02:59.390> boost<00:02:59.630> kind<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
then there's a speed boost kind of the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.330 
then there's a speed boost kind of the
center<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.500> map<00:03:00.620> which<00:03:00.799> can<00:03:00.980> be<00:03:01.100> pretty

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
center of the map which can be pretty

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.220 
center of the map which can be pretty
useful<00:03:01.549> for<00:03:01.970> Juke<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.510> people<00:03:02.870> out<00:03:03.019> on

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
useful for Juke and people out on

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.430 
useful for Juke and people out on
escaping<00:03:04.010> from<00:03:04.340> certain<00:03:04.730> situations<00:03:05.329> but<00:03:06.320> you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
escaping from certain situations but you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.900 
escaping from certain situations but you
have<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.769> careful<00:03:06.950> because<00:03:07.160> there's<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.760> lot

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
have to be careful because there's a lot

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.789 
have to be careful because there's a lot
of<00:03:07.940> potential<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.510> fall<00:03:08.810> off<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.320> map<00:03:09.410> into

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
of potential to fall off the map into

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.370 
of potential to fall off the map into
the<00:03:09.890> water<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.430> then<00:03:11.390> lastly<00:03:11.959> there's<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
the water and then lastly there's the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.650 
the water and then lastly there's the
over<00:03:12.890> shield<00:03:13.130> which<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.489> kind<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:13.940> tunnel

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
over shield which is kind of in tunnel

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.270 
over shield which is kind of in tunnel
at<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.870> back<00:03:15.019> of<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.200> map<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.920> also

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
at the back of the map and that is also

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.060 
at the back of the map and that is also
very<00:03:16.579> useful<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:17.680> obviously<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.890> know<00:03:18.980> you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
very useful on obviously you know you

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.610 
very useful on obviously you know you
can<00:03:19.340> get<00:03:19.459> some<00:03:19.670> great<00:03:19.940> encounters<00:03:20.600> using<00:03:21.500> that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
can get some great encounters using that

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.009 
can get some great encounters using that
in<00:03:21.799> an<00:03:22.070> initial<00:03:22.579> encounter<00:03:23.000> on<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> map<00:03:23.359> to

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
in an initial encounter on the map to

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.130 
in an initial encounter on the map to
your<00:03:24.049> advantage<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.799> can<00:03:25.190> be<00:03:25.519> really<00:03:25.790> great<00:03:26.140> but

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
your advantage I can be really great but

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.289 
your advantage I can be really great but
yeah<00:03:27.590> back<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.100> what<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.340> was<00:03:28.400> saying<00:03:28.579> about<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
yeah back to what I was saying about the

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.569 
yeah back to what I was saying about the
hard<00:03:29.870> connections<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.799> top<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.250> map<00:03:31.400> is

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
hard connections the top of the map is

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.430 
hard connections the top of the map is
very<00:03:31.790> powerful<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:32.510> yeah<00:03:32.959> there's<00:03:33.230> that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
very powerful but yeah there's that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.650 
very powerful but yeah there's that
little<00:03:34.280> bolt<00:03:34.609> pipe<00:03:35.090> up<00:03:35.269> there<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.570> then

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
little bolt pipe up there and then

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.870 
little bolt pipe up there and then
there's<00:03:35.840> two<00:03:36.019> ramps<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.040> basically<00:03:37.640> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
there's two ramps in the basically the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.819 
there's two ramps in the basically the
bases<00:03:38.239> on<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.690> that's<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.019> but<00:03:39.620> then

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
bases on that and that's it but then

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.800 
bases on that and that's it but then
there's<00:03:40.040> also<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.430> lift<00:03:40.820> from<00:03:41.150> basically<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
there's also a lift from basically the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.840 
there's also a lift from basically the
over<00:03:42.170> shield<00:03:42.410> area<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:42.950> there's<00:03:43.609> these<00:03:43.790> two

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
over shield area and there's these two

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.000 
over shield area and there's these two
teleporters<00:03:44.810> which<00:03:44.989> teleport<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.769> to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
teleporters which teleport you up to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.940 
teleporters which teleport you up to
this<00:03:46.160> exposed<00:03:47.060> pipe<00:03:47.600> running<00:03:48.079> across<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.769> top

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
this exposed pipe running across the top

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.530 
this exposed pipe running across the top
of<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.130> map<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.459> that<00:03:49.910> pipe<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.390> very

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
of the map and that pipe is very

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.780 
of the map and that pipe is very
powerful<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.680> it's<00:03:51.829> also<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.130> very<00:03:52.190> dangerous

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
powerful but it's also a very dangerous

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.670 
powerful but it's also a very dangerous
position<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.569> can<00:03:53.690> fall<00:03:53.959> off<00:03:53.989> into<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.530> water

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
position you can fall off into the water

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.550 
position you can fall off into the water
and<00:03:54.950> die<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.489> it's<00:03:55.880> also<00:03:56.060> very<00:03:56.329> open<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.380> it's

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
and die and it's also very open so it's

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.199 
and die and it's also very open so it's
a<00:03:57.650> difficult<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.280> control<00:03:58.549> but<00:03:58.819> all<00:03:59.030> these

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
a difficult to control but all these

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.410 
a difficult to control but all these
elements<00:03:59.450> combine<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.829> make<00:04:01.280> Akash<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:01.790> really

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
elements combine to make Akash a really

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.360 
elements combine to make Akash a really
great<00:04:02.660> map<00:04:02.870> for<00:04:03.109> 2v<00:04:03.260> two<00:04:03.380> encounters

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
great map for 2v two encounters

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.180 
great map for 2v two encounters
you<00:04:04.760> know<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:05.180> encourages<00:04:05.750> teamwork<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.349> just

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
has a lot of interesting geometry that

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.910 
has a lot of interesting geometry that
you<00:04:10.849> can<00:04:11.000> interact<00:04:11.239> with<00:04:11.629> so<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.769> really
