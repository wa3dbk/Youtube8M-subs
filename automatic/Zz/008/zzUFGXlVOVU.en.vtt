00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
different not every amputee has the same

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.030 
different not every amputee has the same
kind<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.239> amputation<00:02:14.690> some<00:02:15.410> are<00:02:15.560> above<00:02:15.829> elbow

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
some are far below the elbow some are

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.560 
some are far below the elbow some are
you<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.430> very<00:02:19.670> close<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.090> elbow<00:02:20.390> like

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
you know very close to the elbow like

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.120 
you know very close to the elbow like
mine<00:02:20.780> are<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.200> still<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.799> elbow<00:02:22.100> i

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.930 
still have flexibility and this is what
works<00:02:24.769> for<00:02:24.980> me<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.370> if<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.579> works<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:25.820> you

see<00:02:28.510> how<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.570> guys<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.620> know<00:02:30.650> work<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.070> out

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
see how you guys you know work this out

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.340 
see how you guys you know work this out
but<00:02:31.640> i<00:02:31.850> feel<00:02:32.329> this<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.600> good<00:02:32.750> starting<00:02:33.079> point

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
but i feel this is a good starting point

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.990 
but i feel this is a good starting point
so<00:02:33.859> what<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> do<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.340> start<00:02:34.370> wrapping<00:02:34.910> it

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
so what you do is you start wrapping it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.759 
so what you do is you start wrapping it
around<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.359> stump<00:02:37.660> barring<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.560> velcro

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
around the stump barring that the velcro

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.199 
around the stump barring that the velcro
doesn't<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.280> stuck<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:40.579> anything<00:02:40.820> on<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.090> way

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
doesn't get stuck on anything on the way

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.649 
doesn't get stuck on anything on the way
up<00:02:41.329> but<00:02:42.019> um

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
up but um

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.959 
up but um
you<00:02:44.659> just<00:02:44.870> start<00:02:45.049> wrapping<00:02:45.379> around<00:02:45.849> keep<00:02:46.849> an

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
you just start wrapping around keep an

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.220 
you just start wrapping around keep an
even<00:02:47.090> amount<00:02:47.269> of<00:02:47.450> pressure<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.920> it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.130 

I<00:02:52.319> usually<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.519> fairly<00:02:53.760> tight

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
I usually like to get it fairly tight

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.660 
I usually like to get it fairly tight
not<00:02:55.140> too<00:02:55.170> worried<00:02:55.530> about<00:02:55.590> choking<00:02:56.430> of

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
not too worried about choking of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.149 
not too worried about choking of
circulation<00:02:57.450> off<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.750> played<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.739> know<00:02:58.860> three

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
circulation off I played you know three

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.250 
circulation off I played you know three
hour<00:02:59.310> sets<00:02:59.790> with<00:03:00.030> my<00:03:00.180> band<00:03:00.450> before<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.170> not

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
hour sets with my band before and not

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
had I'm not had any problems with it so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.020 
had I'm not had any problems with it so

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
as you can see you know it's just

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.300 
as you can see you know it's just
tightly<00:03:06.480> wrapped<00:03:06.690> around<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.049> stump<00:03:07.349> you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.160 
about three layers between the stick and
my<00:03:21.030> stump<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.599> two<00:03:21.750> layers<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.079> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
my stump and then two layers on the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.740 
my stump and then two layers on the
outside<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.769> help<00:03:22.890> keep<00:03:23.159> it<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.489> place<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:24.569> you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
outside to help keep it in place if you

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.150

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
put it on one layer it's going to loosen

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160 
put it on one layer it's going to loosen
it<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.549> little<00:03:26.640> bit<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.629> know<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.959> closer

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
it up a little bit you know the closer

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.220 
it up a little bit you know the closer
the<00:03:28.379> stump<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.610> stick<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:31.019> more

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the stump you have the stick the more

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.420 
the stump you have the stick the more
you're<00:03:31.410> going<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.620> feel<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.190> more<00:03:32.370> it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
you're going to feel it the more it

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.259 
you're going to feel it the more it
might<00:03:32.579> hurt<00:03:32.790> your<00:03:32.970> stump<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:34.340> also<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:36.150> know

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
might hurt your stump and also you know

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.670 
might hurt your stump and also you know
the<00:03:36.390> more<00:03:36.510> restrictive<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.170> stick<00:03:37.379> is<00:03:37.500> going

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the more restrictive the stick is going

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.530 
the more restrictive the stick is going
to<00:03:37.799> be<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.370> pretty<00:03:38.760> good<00:03:39.000> here<00:03:39.239> for<00:03:39.420> me

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
to be this is pretty good here for me

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.360 
to be this is pretty good here for me
it's<00:03:39.750> pretty<00:03:39.959> moderate<00:03:40.379> you<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.129> I<00:03:41.160> can

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
it's pretty moderate you know I can

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.449 
it's pretty moderate you know I can
still<00:03:41.640> do<00:03:41.790> bounce<00:03:42.060> rolls<00:03:42.390> off<00:03:42.569> of<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.459> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
still do bounce rolls off of it and you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.000 
still do bounce rolls off of it and you
know<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.609> works<00:03:44.790> pretty<00:03:44.940> well<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.859> can

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
know it works pretty well so you can

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.780 
know it works pretty well so you can
play<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.569> two<00:03:48.810> handed<00:03:49.140> drummer<00:03:49.640> only<00:03:50.640> with

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
consistently it's going to come apart in

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.180 
consistently it's going to come apart in
layers<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.900> you're<00:04:49.020> just<00:04:49.110> going<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.380> lose<00:04:50.010> it
