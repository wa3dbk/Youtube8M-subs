to<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> boil<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.580> only<00:01:27.910> tricky<00:01:28.210> part<00:01:28.240> about

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
to a boil the only tricky part about

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.060 
to a boil the only tricky part about
this<00:01:28.750> recipe<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.410> you<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.679> to<00:01:29.770> catch

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
this recipe is that you have to catch

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.440 
this recipe is that you have to catch
the<00:01:30.310> milk<00:01:30.520> right<00:01:31.330> before<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.899> boils<00:01:33.450> depending

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
the milk right before it boils depending

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.969 
the milk right before it boils depending
on<00:01:34.539> your<00:01:34.630> stove<00:01:34.899> this<00:01:35.140> will<00:01:35.259> take<00:01:35.410> about<00:01:35.530> 10<00:01:35.950> to

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
on your stove this will take about 10 to

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.600 
on your stove this will take about 10 to
15<00:01:36.520> minutes

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.000 

so<00:01:40.540> it's<00:01:40.690> important<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.260> keep<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.530> very<00:01:41.740> close

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
so it's important to keep a very close

00:01:42.010 --> 00:02:00.340 
so it's important to keep a very close
eye<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.520> your<00:01:42.670> milk<00:01:42.880> because<00:01:43.180> if<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.420> burns

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.780 

so<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.440> gonna<00:02:01.560> explain<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.070> process<00:02:02.520> now

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
so I'm gonna explain the process now

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
so I'm gonna explain the process now
because<00:02:03.360> once<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> bill<00:02:03.780> gets<00:02:03.990> hot<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:04.409> going

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
because once the bill gets hot I'm going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.609 
because once the bill gets hot I'm going
to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.680> working<00:02:04.770> real<00:02:05.130> fast<00:02:05.420> okay<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.229> once<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to be working real fast okay so once the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.980 
to be working real fast okay so once the
bill<00:02:07.800> gets<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> boil<00:02:08.490> it's<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:08.940> rise<00:02:09.209> let

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
bill gets to a boil it's gonna rise let

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.260 
bill gets to a boil it's gonna rise let
it<00:02:10.110> rise<00:02:10.289> three<00:02:11.130> inches<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.060> then

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
it rise three inches and then

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.199 
it rise three inches and then
immediately<00:02:12.750> turn<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> heat<00:02:13.440> off<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:14.209> swirl

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
immediately turn the heat off and swirl

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:25.070 
immediately turn the heat off and swirl
in<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.510> vinegar<00:02:22.730> all<00:02:23.730> right<00:02:23.880> boys<00:02:24.180> she's<00:02:24.930> an

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
in the vinegar all right boys she's an

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:42.970 
in the vinegar all right boys she's an
activity<00:02:25.620> called<00:02:26.310> spot<00:02:26.640> rate

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.930 

so<00:02:44.030> he<00:02:45.030> turned<00:02:45.330> off<00:02:45.590> vinegars<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.890> let<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.640> sit

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
so he turned off vinegars in let it sit

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.740 
so he turned off vinegars in let it sit
for<00:02:47.970> 10<00:02:48.270> minutes<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> stove<00:02:50.569> check<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.690> out

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
for 10 minutes on the stove check it out

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.479 
for 10 minutes on the stove check it out
it's<00:02:54.750> already<00:02:54.840> starting<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.260> separate<00:02:58.489> it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
it's already starting to separate it

00:02:59.489 --> 00:04:51.930 
it's already starting to separate it
smells<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.850> cheese

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.430 

next<00:04:52.660> time<00:04:53.760> as<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:54.880> can<00:04:55.000> see<00:04:55.270> solids<00:04:56.080> have

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
next time as you can see solids have

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.910 
next time as you can see solids have
started<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.830> separate<00:04:57.250> from<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.550> liquids
