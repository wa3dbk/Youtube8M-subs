already<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.459> know<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:26.639> might<00:03:26.880> want<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.150> if

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
already you know you might want it if

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.280 
already you know you might want it if
you<00:03:27.329> waited<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.959> didn't<00:03:28.139> do<00:03:28.200> the

you waited and didn't do the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.599 
you waited and didn't do the
supercharged<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.920> could<00:03:29.100> probably<00:03:29.280> get<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
supercharged you could probably get the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.250 
supercharged you could probably get the
supercharger<00:03:30.239> afterwards<00:03:30.690> no<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.109> guys

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
supercharger afterwards no but you guys

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.720 
supercharger afterwards no but you guys
have<00:03:31.590> lingenfelter<00:03:32.190> still<00:03:32.430> offer<00:03:32.579> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
supercharger and all that stuff

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.140 
supercharger and all that stuff
separately<00:03:34.410> anyway<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.819> can<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.060> done

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
separately anyway so that can be done

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.120

also six twos mm-hmm you know the
supercharger<00:03:51.500> adds<00:03:52.400> about<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.700> hundred

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
supercharger adds about a hundred

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.130 
supercharger adds about a hundred
horsepower<00:03:53.210> it's<00:03:53.600> something<00:03:53.900> under<00:03:54.110> a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
horsepower it's something under a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.660 
horsepower it's something under a
hundred<00:03:54.260> horsepower<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.310> thing<00:03:55.490> really

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
hundred horsepower so this thing really

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.120 
hundred horsepower so this thing really
goes<00:03:55.910> what's<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.570> displacement<00:03:57.530> yeah<00:03:57.800> this

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
goes what's the displacement yeah this

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.670 
goes what's the displacement yeah this
is<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.340> six<00:03:58.640> -<00:03:58.790> six<00:03:59.120> -<00:03:59.330> yeah<00:03:59.570> actually<00:04:00.020> this<00:04:00.380> this

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
is a six - six - yeah actually this this

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.590 
is a six - six - yeah actually this this
one<00:04:00.950> was<00:04:01.160> mine<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.760> be<00:04:01.880> honest<00:04:02.210> with<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.540> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
one was mine to be honest with you and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.480 
one was mine to be honest with you and
so<00:04:02.810> it's<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.230> seer<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.770> highest<00:04:03.950> level

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
so it's the seer it's the highest level

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.690 
so it's the seer it's the highest level
of<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:05.560> Silverado<00:04:06.560> truck<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:07.430> they're<00:04:07.670> a

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
of a Silverado truck and so they're a

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.220 
of a Silverado truck and so they're a
better<00:04:07.940> interior<00:04:08.270> and<00:04:08.600> everything<00:04:08.870> else<00:04:09.020> how

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
better interior and everything else how

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.540 
better interior and everything else how
much<00:04:09.410> horsepower<00:04:09.710> are<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.070> making<00:04:10.400> here

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
much horsepower are you making here

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.660 
much horsepower are you making here
that's<00:04:10.940> by<00:04:11.180> 5:30<00:04:11.630> Wood<00:04:12.200> Edelbrock<00:04:12.980> use<00:04:13.340> the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
that's by 5:30 Wood Edelbrock use the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.610 
that's by 5:30 Wood Edelbrock use the
same<00:04:13.910> Edelbrock<00:04:14.780> does<00:04:15.020> their<00:04:15.200> own<00:04:15.350> but

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
same Edelbrock does their own but

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.229 
same Edelbrock does their own but
similar<00:04:16.070> screws<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.700> think<00:04:16.910> on<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.150> inside

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
similar screws I think on the inside

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.210 
similar screws I think on the inside
this<00:04:17.720> one's<00:04:17.959> from<00:04:18.110> Magnuson<00:04:18.650> as<00:04:18.770> Ken<00:04:19.040> was

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
this one's from Magnuson as Ken was

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.060 
this one's from Magnuson as Ken was
saying<00:04:19.520> and<00:04:19.790> there<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:21.020> way<00:04:21.560> back<00:04:21.830> make<00:04:22.040> a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
saying and there is a way back make a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.490 
saying and there is a way back make a
good<00:04:22.310> blower<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.300> they<00:04:23.450> really<00:04:23.690> do<00:04:23.870> elder

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
good blower and they really do elder

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.380 
good blower and they really do elder
Brock<00:04:24.680> will<00:04:24.860> have<00:04:25.010> have<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.460> supercharger<00:04:26.120> also

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
Brock will have have a supercharger also

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.670 
Brock will have have a supercharger also
and<00:04:26.510> I'm<00:04:26.600> sure<00:04:26.780> they'll<00:04:26.960> be<00:04:27.020> ready<00:04:27.260> for<00:04:27.440> trucks

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
and I'm sure they'll be ready for trucks

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.530 
and I'm sure they'll be ready for trucks
in<00:04:28.160> fact<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.850> think<00:04:29.060> they've<00:04:29.210> got<00:04:29.360> them

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
in fact I think they've got them

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.260 
in fact I think they've got them
completed<00:04:29.990> right<00:04:30.170> now<00:04:30.320> but<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:31.730> Magnusson

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
completed right now but the Magnusson

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.970 
completed right now but the Magnusson
for<00:04:32.450> this<00:04:32.570> vehicle<00:04:32.990> really<00:04:33.200> works<00:04:33.530> out<00:04:33.680> well

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
for this vehicle really works out well

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.820 
for this vehicle really works out well
lots<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.790> power<00:04:34.970> lots<00:04:35.420> of<00:04:35.570> fun<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:35.990> these<00:04:36.530> twin

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
lots of power lots of fun and these twin

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.040 
lots of power lots of fun and these twin
screws<00:04:37.070> must<00:04:37.280> make<00:04:37.570> incredible<00:04:38.570> low-end

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
screws must make incredible low-end

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.810 
screws must make incredible low-end
torque<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.680> that's<00:04:40.100> what<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.430> really<00:04:40.550> won't

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
torque and that's what you really won't

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.550 
torque and that's what you really won't
be<00:04:40.910> descending<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.450> open<00:04:41.810> right<00:04:41.840> yep

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
be descending it open right yep

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.890 
be descending it open right yep
should<00:04:43.130> we<00:04:43.220> fire<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.550> up<00:04:43.850> give<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.330> listen<00:04:44.570> we

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
should we fire it up give it a listen we

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.580
