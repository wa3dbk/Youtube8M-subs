you slide that dot right behind that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.669 
you slide that dot right behind that
point<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.600> you're<00:01:28.810> behind<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.320> shoulder

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.210 
how to look for that the saddle sits
balance<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.700> horse<00:02:10.560> let's<00:02:11.560> talk<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.099> little

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
balance on the horse let's talk a little

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.830 
balance on the horse let's talk a little
bit<00:02:12.459> what<00:02:12.700> would<00:02:12.849> happen<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.390> balance<00:02:13.690> is

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
bit what would happen if the balance is

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280 
bit what would happen if the balance is
off<00:02:14.050> let's<00:02:15.010> say<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.400> saddle<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.930> too<00:02:16.930> high<00:02:17.140> in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
off let's say the saddle is too high in

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.380 
off let's say the saddle is too high in
the<00:02:17.379> back<00:02:17.530> or<00:02:17.830> too<00:02:18.010> low<00:02:18.099> in<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.250> front<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the back or too low in the front the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.839 
the back or too low in the front the
pressure<00:02:19.660> would<00:02:19.989> go<00:02:20.050> all<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> way<00:02:20.730> into<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
pressure would go all the way into the

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.330 
pressure would go all the way into the
shoulder<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.569> it's<00:02:23.140> pinching<00:02:23.709> very<00:02:23.920> hard<00:02:24.190> on

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
shoulder and it's pinching very hard on

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.910 
shoulder and it's pinching very hard on
the<00:02:24.459> side<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.940> winners<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.480> what<00:02:26.440> happens

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
the side of the winners and what happens

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.400 
the side of the winners and what happens
to<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.220> riders<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:28.030> won't<00:02:28.629> fall<00:02:28.870> forward<00:02:29.290> to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
to the riders I won't fall forward to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.589 
to the riders I won't fall forward to
what<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.560> do<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.890> do

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
what I do I do

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.750 
what I do I do
lean<00:02:31.599> back<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.260> my<00:02:32.590> lower<00:02:32.860> disc<00:02:33.220> gives<00:02:33.640> them

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
lean back and my lower disc gives them

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.809 
lean back and my lower disc gives them
off<00:02:33.970> problem<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.780> order<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.580> help<00:02:36.580> myself

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
off problem and in order to help myself

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.869 
off problem and in order to help myself
I<00:02:37.330> then<00:02:37.720> lift<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.470> leg<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.340> get<00:02:39.550> into<00:02:39.849> a

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
I then lift my leg and I get into a

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.610 
I then lift my leg and I get into a
share<00:02:40.150> seat<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.750> very<00:02:41.200> uncomfortable

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
share seat so a very uncomfortable

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.619 
share seat so a very uncomfortable
position<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.580> rider<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.420> very

uncomfortable<00:02:44.290> for<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.590> horse<00:02:44.910> what<00:02:45.910> would

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
uncomfortable for the horse what would

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.660 
uncomfortable for the horse what would
happen<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.810> other<00:02:47.709> option<00:02:48.250> when<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
happen to the other option when the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.300 
happen to the other option when the
saddle<00:02:49.030> would<00:02:49.300> be<00:02:49.480> too<00:02:49.660> high<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.110> front<00:02:50.410> or
