on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> back<00:01:31.079> which<00:01:31.650> holds<00:01:32.070> our<00:01:32.159> two<00:01:32.369> double-a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
on the back which holds our two double-a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.249 
on the back which holds our two double-a
batteries<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:33.540> charges<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.049> thing

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
batteries that's what charges this thing

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.630 
batteries that's what charges this thing
it<00:01:34.350> makes<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.860> run<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it makes this thing run and then you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.740 
it makes this thing run and then you
have<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:36.030> slot<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.540> nano

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
have a little slot for your nano

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
have a little slot for your nano
receiver<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> case<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.950> new<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.340> you'll

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
receiver in case it's not new so you'll

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
receiver in case it's not new so you'll
have<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> plug<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.030> computer<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.720> don't

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have a plug in a computer so you don't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.310 
have a plug in a computer so you don't
lose<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
lose it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
lose it
and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> sides<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.299> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and then on the sides we do have a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.760 
and then on the sides we do have a
little<00:01:42.630> bit<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.899> rubber<00:01:43.110> grip<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.649> way

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
little bit of a rubber grip that way

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.200 
little bit of a rubber grip that way
just<00:01:44.009> gives<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> better<00:01:44.430> feel<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
just gives you a better feel and a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.870 
just gives you a better feel and a
better<00:01:45.390> grip<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.899> side<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> gamepad<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
better grip on side of the gamepad and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.340 
better grip on side of the gamepad and
so<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.360> pretty<00:01:48.600> much<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> buttons

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
so that's pretty much all the buttons

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
so that's pretty much all the buttons
and<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> analog<00:01:50.130> sticks<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and all the analog sticks and so you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.550 
and all the analog sticks and so you
might<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.360> asking<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:52.110> does<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.409> actually

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
might be asking how does it actually

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.679 
might be asking how does it actually
work<00:01:52.740> does<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.189> even<00:01:53.369> function<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
work does it even function right and it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.630 
work does it even function right and it
does<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.200> find<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> analog<00:01:56.130> sticks<00:01:56.460> work

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
does I find that the analog sticks work

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.219 
does I find that the analog sticks work
very<00:01:56.909> well<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> nice<00:01:57.659> resistance

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
very well they have a nice resistance

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.600 
very well they have a nice resistance
they<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:58.740> fly<00:01:59.070> around<00:01:59.219> they're<00:01:59.549> not

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
they just don't fly around they're not

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
they just don't fly around they're not
completely<00:02:00.149> loose<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.960> buttons<00:02:01.350> give

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
completely loose all the buttons give

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.139 
completely loose all the buttons give
you<00:02:01.619> nice<00:02:01.770> tactile<00:02:02.250> feedback<00:02:02.579> nothing's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
you nice tactile feedback nothing's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
you nice tactile feedback nothing's

one by one works with emulators and
things<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.870> ever<00:02:40.020> all<00:02:40.230> worked<00:02:40.500> very

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
things like that it ever all worked very

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.650 
things like that it ever all worked very
good<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.130> find<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.640> very<00:02:41.670> comfortable<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> use

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
not too heavy it's a little bit heavier

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.040 
not too heavy it's a little bit heavier
than<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.489> Wii<00:02:47.610> U<00:02:47.760> pro<00:02:47.940> controller<00:02:48.030> which<00:02:48.720> is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
than the Wii U pro controller which is

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.210 
than the Wii U pro controller which is
what<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> compared<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.739> since<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.160> don't

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
what I compared it to since I don't

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.410 
what I compared it to since I don't
really<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.580> any<00:02:50.700> other<00:02:50.730> controllers<00:02:51.330> around

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
really have any other controllers around

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
really have any other controllers around
here<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.170> compare<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.850> it's

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
here like that to compare it to and it's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.460 
here like that to compare it to and it's
also<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.239> little<00:02:54.480> bit<00:02:54.570> smaller<00:02:54.930> than<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> Wii<00:02:55.320> U

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
also a little bit smaller than the Wii U

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.170 
also a little bit smaller than the Wii U
pro<00:02:55.620> controller<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.730> Wii<00:02:56.760> U<00:02:56.970> pro<00:02:57.120> controller

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
pro controller the Wii U pro controller

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.990 
pro controller the Wii U pro controller
is<00:02:57.630> lighter<00:02:57.840> though<00:02:58.080> like<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.739> said<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.819> feel

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
is lighter though like I said and I feel

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.220 
is lighter though like I said and I feel
like<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.239> Wii<00:03:00.360> U<00:03:00.480> pro<00:03:00.630> controller<00:03:00.720> sits

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
like the Wii U pro controller sits

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.110 
like the Wii U pro controller sits
better<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> hand<00:03:01.890> it's<00:03:02.280> not<00:03:02.459> as<00:03:02.670> much<00:03:02.940> as<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
better in the hand it's not as much as a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.420 
better in the hand it's not as much as a
curve<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.750> not<00:03:03.900> such<00:03:04.110> an<00:03:04.260> extreme<00:03:04.590> curve<00:03:04.920> you

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
curve it's not such an extreme curve you

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.860 
curve it's not such an extreme curve you
can<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> way<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.390> Wii<00:03:06.510> U<00:03:06.660> pro

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
can see this is the way the Wii U pro

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.710 
can see this is the way the Wii U pro
controller<00:03:06.900> goes<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:09.030> Wii<00:03:09.150> U<00:03:09.330> or<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
gaming controller has a little bit more

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
gaming controller has a little bit more
of<00:03:13.739> an<00:03:13.830> extreme<00:03:14.130> curve<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:14.760> I'll<00:03:14.850> put<00:03:15.000> them

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
of an extreme curve so I'll put them

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.699 
of an extreme curve so I'll put them
side-by-side<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.780> I'll<00:03:16.050> show<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> closer<00:03:16.560> up

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
side-by-side and I'll show a closer up

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.670 
side-by-side and I'll show a closer up
view<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:18.000> seems<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.510> sit<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.110> little<00:03:19.560> bit
