00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.829 
to reweld the shafts steering shafts in
a<00:00:12.929> lathe<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:14.130> gonna<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.480> tough<00:00:15.480> spot

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
a lathe so we're gonna have tough spot

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.010 
a lathe so we're gonna have tough spot
so<00:00:16.350> if<00:00:17.340> that's<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:17.910> gonna<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.210> now<00:00:18.420> and

finished<00:01:52.869> finally<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.720> remote<00:01:55.720> on<00:01:55.750> the

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
finished finally the remote on the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.660 
finished finally the remote on the
cockpit<00:01:56.519> so<00:01:57.810> where's<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.929> remote<00:01:59.340> let<00:02:00.340> me<00:02:00.489> see

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
cockpit so where's the remote let me see

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:15.610 
cockpit so where's the remote let me see
there<00:02:01.239> is<00:02:05.580> whoops<00:02:06.580> nose<00:02:07.209> yeah<00:02:07.479> that's<00:02:07.750> open

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.150

this<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.680> when<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.070> seats<00:02:21.370> forward<00:02:21.820> we

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
this up and when the seats forward we

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.320 
this up and when the seats forward we
can<00:02:22.390> see<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.750> turbo<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.500> manifold

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
can see the turbo that's the manifold

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330 
can see the turbo that's the manifold
does<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.480> third<00:02:28.720> turbo<00:02:29.140> setup<00:02:29.350> which<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.920> think

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
does the third turbo setup which I think

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.210 
does the third turbo setup which I think
still<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:32.100> have<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> bigger<00:02:33.420> compressor

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
still we can have a bigger compressor

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.930 
still we can have a bigger compressor
set<00:02:36.220> up<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.580> only<00:02:36.760> five<00:02:37.210> psi<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.940> redo

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
set up for only five psi have to redo

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.670 
set up for only five psi have to redo
the<00:02:40.060> piping<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.810> exhaust<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
the piping for the exhaust because of

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.330 
the piping for the exhaust because of
the<00:02:44.860> flange<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.670> turbo<00:02:45.970> flange<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.600> different

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the flange the turbo flange is different

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.230 
the flange the turbo flange is different
that's<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.670> reverse<00:02:49.530> reverse<00:02:50.530> gear<00:02:51.240> gym

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
that's the reverse reverse gear gym

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.020 
that's the reverse reverse gear gym
still<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.750> satisfy<00:02:53.230> I'm<00:02:53.410> still<00:02:53.710> gonna<00:02:54.030> have

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
still not satisfy I'm still gonna have

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.060 
still not satisfy I'm still gonna have
to<00:02:55.480> modify<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:58.410> guess<00:02:59.410> let's<00:02:59.650> go<00:02:59.860> for<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
to modify it so I guess let's go for a

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.620 
to modify it so I guess let's go for a
ride<00:03:01.770> let's<00:03:02.770> move<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.070> seat<00:03:03.310> back<00:03:03.420> hold<00:03:04.420> on<00:03:04.600> a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
ride let's move the seat back hold on a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.260 
ride let's move the seat back hold on a
little<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:07.560> okay<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.420> just<00:03:10.450> jump<00:03:11.020> in<00:03:11.200> I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
little bit okay so we just jump in I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.670
