armor the final thing I wanted to point
out<00:03:23.940> was<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.079> really<00:03:25.350> well<00:03:25.590> thought<00:03:25.920> through

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
out was the really well thought through

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.509 
out was the really well thought through
size<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.540> bag<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.260> if<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.980> look<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.280> both

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
size of the bag so if you look at both

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.449 
size of the bag so if you look at both
the<00:03:29.730> profile<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.450> terms<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.870> depth<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the profile in terms of depth and the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.460 
the profile in terms of depth and the
width<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> pack<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.690> was<00:03:33.840> designed<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.380> be

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
width of the pack it was designed to be

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.210 
width of the pack it was designed to be
no<00:03:34.769> wider<00:03:35.070> than<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.579> armor<00:03:36.060> itself<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.799> it

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
no wider than the armor itself and so it

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.699 
no wider than the armor itself and so it
doesn't<00:03:38.519> impact<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.299> user's<00:03:39.660> ability<00:03:39.810> to

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
doesn't impact a user's ability to

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.370 
doesn't impact a user's ability to
operate<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.310> tight<00:03:42.120> spaces<00:03:42.450> get<00:03:43.110> through

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
operate in tight spaces get through

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.479 
operate in tight spaces get through
doorways<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:43.950> type<00:03:44.640> of<00:03:44.850> thing<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.470> also

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
doorways that type of thing and also

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.940 
doorways that type of thing and also
reduces<00:03:47.489> stack<00:03:47.820> height<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.570> back<00:03:48.950> that's

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
reduces stack height on the back that's

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.239 
reduces stack height on the back that's
