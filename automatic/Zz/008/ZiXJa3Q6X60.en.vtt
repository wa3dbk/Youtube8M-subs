center<00:02:02.020> mark<00:02:02.259> okay<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:06.250> here<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:07.090> top<00:02:07.330> dead

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
center mark okay this here is top dead

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.620 
center mark okay this here is top dead
center<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:09.039> I'm<00:02:10.000> not<00:02:10.179> really<00:02:10.360> even<00:02:10.479> sure

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
center and then I'm not really even sure

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.089 
center and then I'm not really even sure
on<00:02:11.019> this<00:02:11.230> one<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.620> I'm<00:02:11.680> not<00:02:11.739> even<00:02:11.830> going<00:02:12.040> to

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
on this one so I'm not even going to

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.710 
on this one so I'm not even going to
guess<00:02:12.400> what<00:02:12.670> these<00:02:12.790> numbers<00:02:13.000> are<00:02:13.299> because<00:02:13.569> all

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
guess what these numbers are because all

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.949 
guess what these numbers are because all
the<00:02:13.810> numbers<00:02:13.930> are<00:02:14.230> rubbed<00:02:14.410> off<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:14.920> one

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the numbers are rubbed off on this one

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.530 
the numbers are rubbed off on this one
so<00:02:16.959> what<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.680> do<00:02:18.060> instead<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.299> trying<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
so what you can do instead of trying to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.759 
so what you can do instead of trying to
find<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.989> sticker<00:02:20.349> or<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.160> time<00:02:21.370> being

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
find a sticker or for the time being

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.960 
find a sticker or for the time being
this<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:23.950> not<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.220> most<00:02:24.370> accurate<00:02:24.579> way

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
this is not the most accurate way

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.789 
this is not the most accurate way
obviously<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.569> most<00:02:25.750> accurate<00:02:26.200> way<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.650> an

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
obviously the most accurate way is an

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.120 
obviously the most accurate way is an
installed<00:02:27.250> factory<00:02:28.230> sticker<00:02:29.230> as<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.980> would

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
installed factory sticker as you would

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.289 
installed factory sticker as you would
know<00:02:30.690> also<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:33.670> going<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.910> give<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.150> these

know also I'm going to give you these

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.160 
know also I'm going to give you these
measurements<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.019> decimal<00:02:35.799> form<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.900> will

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
measurements in decimal form and I will

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.780 
measurements in decimal form and I will
also<00:02:38.410> convert<00:02:38.769> them<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.430> into

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
also convert them for you into

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.670 
also convert them for you into
fractional<00:02:40.450> form<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.989> if<00:02:41.230> you're<00:02:41.380> going<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.590> be

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
fractional form so if you're going to be

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.009 
fractional form so if you're going to be

like a you know a cal per micrometer or
even<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.340> decimal<00:02:54.340> ruler<00:02:55.299> or<00:02:55.859> scale<00:02:58.109> I'll<00:02:59.109> tell

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
even a decimal ruler or scale I'll tell

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.610 
even a decimal ruler or scale I'll tell
you<00:02:59.500> how<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> do<00:02:59.889> this<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:02.440> know<00:03:02.530> you

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
you how to do this but you know you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.559 
you how to do this but you know you
should<00:03:03.160> really<00:03:03.340> trying<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> find<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.389> that

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
should really trying to find one that

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.930 
should really trying to find one that
has<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.750> installed<00:03:05.260> from<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.470> factory<00:03:05.940> that's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
has it installed from the factory that's

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.340 
has it installed from the factory that's
the<00:03:07.090> best<00:03:07.269> way<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.389> do<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:08.139> this<00:03:08.200> will

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
the best way to do this but this will

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.809 
the best way to do this but this will
get<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.590> started<00:03:08.859> for<00:03:09.010> setting<00:03:09.310> things<00:03:09.549> like

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
get you started for setting things like

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.340 
get you started for setting things like
you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.120> your<00:03:10.389> primary<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.170> secondary

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
you know your primary and secondary

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.039 
you know your primary and secondary
pickups<00:03:12.010> without<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> timing<00:03:13.090> light<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.450> you

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
pickups without a timing light as you

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.759 
pickups without a timing light as you
can<00:03:14.200> see<00:03:14.380> my<00:03:14.530> other<00:03:14.739> videos<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.459> show<00:03:15.700> you

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
can see my other videos that I show you

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.069 
can see my other videos that I show you
so<00:03:17.769> let's<00:03:17.980> start<00:03:18.220> with<00:03:18.600> some<00:03:19.600> things<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:19.959> need

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
so let's start with some things we need

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.849 
so let's start with some things we need
to<00:03:20.139> know<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.819> clockwise<00:03:22.269> rotation

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
to know this is a clockwise rotation

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.490 
to know this is a clockwise rotation
okay<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.239> counterclockwise<00:03:25.750> rotation

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
okay this is a counterclockwise rotation

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.750 
okay this is a counterclockwise rotation
we<00:03:26.859> are<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.130> concerned<00:03:27.549> with<00:03:27.639> any

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
we are not concerned with any

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.610 
we are not concerned with any
counterclockwise<00:03:28.359> rotation<00:03:29.139> so<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.410> are<00:03:29.500> only

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
counterclockwise rotation so we are only

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.400 
counterclockwise rotation so we are only
concerned<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:31.239> way<00:03:31.420> as<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:32.079> sticker

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
concerned with this way as the sticker

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.330 
concerned with this way as the sticker
moves<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:34.120> see<00:03:34.299> if<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.419> can<00:03:34.570> still<00:03:34.780> see<00:03:34.930> that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
moves you see if you can still see that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.160 
moves you see if you can still see that
okay<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.400> do<00:03:37.019> so

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
okay you do so

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
okay you do so
first<00:03:40.170> thing<00:03:40.320> we're<00:03:40.440> going<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.650> point<00:03:40.800> out<00:03:40.950> is

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
first thing we're going to point out is

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.570 
first thing we're going to point out is
the<00:03:41.700> three<00:03:41.940> dot<00:03:42.090> mark<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.710> 17<00:03:44.370> degrees

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
the three dot mark that is 17 degrees

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.000 
the three dot mark that is 17 degrees
after<00:03:45.150> top<00:03:46.050> dead<00:03:46.110> center<00:03:46.880> okay<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.740> from<00:03:49.740> this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
after top dead center okay so from this

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.750 
after top dead center okay so from this
point<00:03:50.310> if<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.940> measure<00:03:51.210> over<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:52.760> to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
point if you measure over this way to

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.610 
point if you measure over this way to
there<00:03:54.060> which<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.630> one<00:03:55.380> point<00:03:56.190> one<00:03:56.910> seven<00:03:57.750> one

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
there which is one point one seven one

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.530 
there which is one point one seven one
five<00:03:59.540> inches<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:02.340> mark<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.760> point<00:04:02.790> that

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
five inches and you mark that point that

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.460 
five inches and you mark that point that
is<00:04:03.750> your<00:04:03.960> zero<00:04:04.380> top<00:04:04.950> dead<00:04:05.220> center<00:04:05.900> that's<00:04:06.900> one

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
is your zero top dead center that's one

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.300 
is your zero top dead center that's one
point<00:04:07.830> one<00:04:08.460> seven<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:09.540> five<00:04:09.960> inches<00:04:10.650> or<00:04:10.800> an

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
point one seven one five inches or an

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.150 
point one seven one five inches or an
inch<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.650> 1164<00:04:14.270> okay<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:17.010> most

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
inch and 1164 okay that is your most

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.979 
inch and 1164 okay that is your most
crucial<00:04:17.670> mark<00:04:17.910> your<00:04:18.299> top<00:04:18.510> dead<00:04:18.690> center

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
crucial mark your top dead center

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.900 
crucial mark your top dead center
because<00:04:19.290> after<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:19.920> measure<00:04:20.160> from<00:04:20.489> there

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
because after this we measure from there

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.730 
because after this we measure from there
so<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.480> want<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.019> thing<00:04:22.170> to<00:04:22.230> be<00:04:22.440> as<00:04:22.530> dead

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
so you want that thing to be as dead

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.840 
so you want that thing to be as dead
nuts<00:04:22.950> as<00:04:23.100> possible<00:04:23.990> okay<00:04:25.020> after<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.130> you

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
nuts as possible okay after that you

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.380 
nuts as possible okay after that you
measure<00:04:27.090> over<00:04:27.710> point<00:04:28.710> three<00:04:29.400> four<00:04:29.820> zero

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
measure over point three four zero

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.880 
measure over point three four zero
inches<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.030> will<00:04:33.300> identify<00:04:33.750> your<00:04:34.500> five

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
inches and that will identify your five

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.210 
inches and that will identify your five
degrees<00:04:35.400> before<00:04:36.210> top<00:04:36.780> dead<00:04:36.840> center<00:04:37.530> that's

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220
