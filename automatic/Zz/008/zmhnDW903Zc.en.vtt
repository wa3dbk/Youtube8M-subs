then and there are other decks and it's
better<00:00:21.680> cnc<00:00:22.680> machining<00:00:23.310> things<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:24.539> what

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
better cnc machining things that's what

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.950 
better cnc machining things that's what
they<00:00:25.050> said<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.320> their<00:00:25.590> website<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.789> is

they said on their website which is
better<00:00:27.960> king<00:00:28.410> pin<00:00:28.590> holes<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.840> counter<00:00:30.840> sinks

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
better king pin holes and counter sinks

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.930 
better king pin holes and counter sinks
and<00:00:34.579> better<00:00:35.579> machine<00:00:36.180> shaped<00:00:37.430> as<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.730> see

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and better machine shaped as you can see

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
and better machine shaped as you can see
there's<00:00:39.180> no<00:00:39.270> crevices<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.920> shaping

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
there's no crevices and the shaping

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.660 
there's no crevices and the shaping
which<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:43.579> full<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.760> quality<00:00:49.579> number<00:00:50.579> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
which is like full on quality number of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.720 
which is like full on quality number of
edges<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.199> perfect<00:00:53.160> shaping

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
edges if you can see so perfect shaping

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.350 
edges if you can see so perfect shaping
they<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> perfect<00:00:54.570> shaping<00:00:55.140> down<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
they have the perfect shaping down and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.189 
they have the perfect shaping down and
so<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.469> got<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.480> emerged<00:01:01.730> yellow

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
so as you can see I got a emerged yellow

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.550 
so as you can see I got a emerged yellow
and<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.729> what<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> say<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.260> lacquer

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:23.030 

get<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> brand<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.380> plies<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:22.040> um

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
get they have a brand the plies are um

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.219 
get they have a brand the plies are um
would<00:01:24.830> read<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:26.580> read<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
would read would read and then the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.340 
would read would read and then the
bottom<00:01:28.590> Bly<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> yellow<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.110> five

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
bottom Bly which is yellow so it's five

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.330 
bottom Bly which is yellow so it's five
o'clock<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.130> very<00:01:32.340> durable<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:34.340> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
o'clock so it's very durable it's you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
o'clock so it's very durable it's you
can't<00:01:35.610> bend<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.210> anything<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:39.229> formed

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
can't bend it or anything so it's formed

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.980 
can't bend it or anything so it's formed
really<00:01:40.680> great<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.119> crevice<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.750> really

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
really great and the crevice is really

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
really great and the crevice is really
good<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.560> he<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.009> fit<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.340> finger<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
good because he can fit your finger in

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.490 
good because he can fit your finger in
it<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> get<00:01:46.200> better<00:01:46.470> pop<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.750> that's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it so you get better pop and so that's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
it so you get better pop and so that's
pretty<00:01:49.829> much<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> review<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> deck<00:01:51.240> the

wheels<00:02:10.890> let<00:02:11.550> me<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.970> over<00:02:12.180> their<00:02:12.420> own

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
wheels let me get over their own

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.069 
wheels let me get over their own
it's<00:02:13.260> better<00:02:13.560> shape<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.370> better<00:02:15.060> curve<00:02:15.599> than

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
it's better shape and better curve than

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.789 
it's better shape and better curve than
a<00:02:16.109> flat<00:02:16.799> base<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.280> morning<00:02:17.459> wood<00:02:17.730> wheels

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
they're curved around all the way around

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.099 
they're curved around all the way around
and<00:03:07.799> stuff<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.669> morning<00:03:09.239> order<00:03:09.540> flatbush

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:19.399 

try<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.169> find<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:14.489> show<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:18.079> yeah<00:03:19.079> i<00:03:19.109> give

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
try to find one to show you yeah i give

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.140 
try to find one to show you yeah i give
it<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.590> five<00:03:19.799> face<00:03:20.129> feel<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:23.579> we<00:03:23.879> show<00:03:24.180> you

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
it a five face feel and we show you

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.479 
it a five face feel and we show you
comparison<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:30.269> can<00:03:30.449> see<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.260> Z<00:03:32.040> shad<00:03:32.280> wheel

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
comparison you can see the Z shad wheel

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.179 
comparison you can see the Z shad wheel
is<00:03:32.849> more<00:03:33.269> curved<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.379> flat-face<00:03:34.889> wheel

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
is more curved in the flat-face wheel

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.020 
is more curved in the flat-face wheel
and<00:03:35.989> better<00:03:37.010> looking<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> here's<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.280> Z<00:03:41.729> shard

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
and better looking so here's the Z shard

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.039 
and better looking so here's the Z shard
wheel<00:03:43.519> nothing<00:03:44.519> wrong<00:03:44.759> with<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.239> perfect

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
wheel nothing wrong with it perfect

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.759 
wheel nothing wrong with it perfect
pretty<00:03:46.470> much<00:03:48.079> really<00:03:49.079> cool<00:03:49.379> color<00:03:49.769> clear<00:03:50.519> and

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
pretty much really cool color clear and

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.909 
pretty much really cool color clear and
they're<00:03:52.769> cheaper<00:03:53.189> than<00:03:53.310> flat<00:03:53.609> base<00:03:55.040> g62<00:03:57.919> and

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
they're cheaper than flat base g62 and

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.789 
they're cheaper than flat base g62 and
here's<00:03:59.129> flat<00:03:59.430> face<00:03:59.699> see<00:04:00.359> it's<00:04:00.569> less<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.530> a

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
here's flat face see it's less of a

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.759 
here's flat face see it's less of a
rounded<00:04:02.699> edge<00:04:02.879> then<00:04:04.459> geesh<00:04:05.459> red<00:04:06.259> z<00:04:07.259> trade<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
rounded edge then geesh red z trade that

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.099 
rounded edge then geesh red z trade that
means<00:04:08.009> it's<00:04:08.189> like<00:04:08.340> thinner<00:04:08.669> so<00:04:09.659> we<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:09.959> get

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
means it's like thinner so we can get

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.920 
means it's like thinner so we can get
more<00:04:10.169> pop<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:11.370> makes<00:04:11.579> sense<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.500> flat<00:04:14.099> face

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
more pop that makes sense so flat face

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.300 
more pop that makes sense so flat face
does<00:04:15.930> get<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.139> little<00:04:16.289> bit<00:04:16.530> scratched<00:04:16.859> up<00:04:17.099> and

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
does get a little bit scratched up and

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.849 
does get a little bit scratched up and
their<00:04:17.880> bearings<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.570> don't<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:19.620> they're

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
their bearings I don't think they're

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.879 
their bearings I don't think they're
things<00:04:20.099> are<00:04:20.370> as<00:04:20.489> good<00:04:20.729> as<00:04:20.789> Z<00:04:21.479> shreds<00:04:21.750> cuz<00:04:22.740> he

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
things are as good as Z shreds cuz he

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.500 
things are as good as Z shreds cuz he
shreds<00:04:23.219> bearings

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
shreds bearings

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.180 
shreds bearings
are<00:04:25.720> clean<00:04:26.730> or<00:04:28.110> flat<00:04:29.110> face<00:04:29.350> or<00:04:29.650> more<00:04:29.950> like

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
are clean or flat face or more like

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:38.760 
are clean or flat face or more like

faster from top face well personally I
think<00:05:33.870> these<00:05:34.870> sheds<00:05:35.050> better<00:05:36.600> looking<00:05:37.600> and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
think these sheds better looking and

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.600 
think these sheds better looking and
better<00:05:39.220> performance

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.620
