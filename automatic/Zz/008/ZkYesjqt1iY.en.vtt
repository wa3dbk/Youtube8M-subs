00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.700
 good morning and welcome to the new random 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700
 car 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.800
 the card you will see that I have moved a little 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.529
 camera towards the center 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 a bit for design a bit for a community a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.900
 little because having the camera pointed in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.969
 face made me a bit disgusted 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.399
 so I do n't know when I'll publish 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.590
 this randon carra however in the meantime 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.800
 After that the service notes that 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 surely it will not come out the next day in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.670
 whose logic I will also turn the gamer jury 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.470
 soon then after doing this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.410
 I don't know if the first one will come out first 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.000
 this video will also be here days 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.670
 gamer finally after years and years vi 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 I also refer that video lire in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.180
 this episode to make it clear without 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 because it is not plural 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.880
 I would like to talk a bit about destinies now not 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.240
 I would like to review the camera 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.869
 fixed super foul because those are 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.020
 things that other people do don't like 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.509
 I have already written my review 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.549
 quite complete up on the corner for 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.950
 regarding the plot in general 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.039
 then somewhere or directly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.219
 in description of minco that article 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.229
 in which I speak of general destinies and if 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.590
 you want you can also comment has 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.079
 indeed better if you create another rooster there 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.099
 below do not die what is happening 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.409
 to make gas 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.219
 then it rises from the case I would like to pass 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.399
 thank you 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.369
 and instead in this video I would like to talk 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.130
 a bit of multiplayer more or less than 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.640
 part over plot of this destiny 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.060
 basically the pain in the ass 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 then the game is beautiful and it's me 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.770
 having so much fun I'm playing 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.300
 we really are with other friends 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.550
 taking everyone well to play at it 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.420
 find ourselves together doing missions 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 this and that one 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.590
 what is the problem the problem of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.320
 destiny is that once of the fruit of 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.800
 nice 20 to be able to go up again by 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.040
 level you have to find some pieces of 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.900
 light level armor 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.239
 adding all these light levels 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.090
 practically one arrives at light level e 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.020
 30 if I'm not mistaken 29 I think it was the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.590
 highest level seen so far what is the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.130
 problem that these objects give you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.950
 light are blue objects with me 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.300
 many will even know there are various types 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.370
 of objects white green purple and then there 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.170
 they are the yellow ones that are the super madonnas 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.620
 to me it would also be enough to find the blue ones 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.480
 the problem is that here after hours and hours of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.660
 put and instanced missions and do not get 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.540
 a cock pretty much how the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.209
 loot in this case of destiny to do chi 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.940
 split your ass you're god on earth 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.150
 do the big but women but the final is 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.829
 always and always repeat randomly e 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.280
 so it does not depend absolutely on 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:31.180
 how good you are from what you do shit and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:35.890
 and it's a bit of a problem for a title 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.200
 this kind because then to spend hours 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.630
 to win games in pvp win them all 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.700
 never miss to always come first 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.120
 and it is possible that you take yourself in the ass 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.410
 a fact a gestaccio I hope that resources 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.730
 surprised more in the car and ass 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.790
 objects and absolutely not find 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.730
 or do nothing distance as today 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.130
 we made three instances of which two 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.720
 equal because we have the ass to peck 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.890
 the playlists that make us do the same 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.569
 level 22 then around 40 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.670
 minutes at a distance and nothing at all 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.470
 the look was a very sad thing 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.470
 i didn't find a dick my friend that 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.019
 level 24 no there is waiting for me 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.760
 from a life because he had ass that it 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.669
 I will make my figer weapons immediately 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.110
 instead I am at level 22 by now 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.210
 a week I can't find 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.639
 a dick but not because he's not good at 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.790
 don't play killer but because i have 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.880
 bad luck simply now tell me if 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.200
 in 2014 we have to have loops based 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.630
 in the ass or in bad luck 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.919
 for me they are things that are neither in nor 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.220
 heaven or earth 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.710
 in addition to this one spends maybe hours ed 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.630
 hours doing those instances are 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.820
 very difficult to die maybe even a 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.850
 couple of times it pulls the Madonnas I ca n't find 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.020
 a cock for me is indecent you ca n't 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.919
 not even pass loot for the reasons that a 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.479
 benches are foreign 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.960
 I once is the only time I have 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.220
 found a purple object was not for the 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.470
 my class 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.270
 ok they had a friend who was exactly 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.650
 hunter of that class you I can 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.200
 give no I can't owe it 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.120
 delete or use it for another mine 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.240
 secondary character that I will never do 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.680
 because starting again means rebuilding 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.180
 hours and hours of cocks not jump able 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.570
 because I think the socks actually 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.530
 they are masked uploads in one 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.990
 indecent manner 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.060
 I don't know what the fuck my destiny is for me 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.490
 becoming a waste of time because 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.380
 there are level 26 raids I would like them 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.350
 do fucking level 26 radio here 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.000
 problems that I don't have enough loot of 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.240
 light level that can bring me the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.030
 level 26 and can I have to go to 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.039
 train by killing the enemies that come out 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.620
 from the cave quoting then what the fuck 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.840
 game is so much worth mourning weapons based 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.580
 as they are brown it does not kill kills 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.289
 march if you like the ass it's okay if not 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.460
 this is what I wanted to tell you 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.690
 I probably repeated the same 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.960
 I design six or seven times but it suits me 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.560
 so because I hope it comes in the head 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.590
 and I hope that 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.200
 at the desks they change something because they don't 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.150
 you can go on like this then now 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.870
 I ask you dear users you have blocked 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.010
 al destiny if so what do you think of 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.710
 what we have just said or 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.750
 utc abused ass 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.300
 let me know some of your experiences 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.580
 I am the only asshole to chiti friends 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:48.470
 who find the nice stuff in one finds 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:52.630
 fuck hello hello feeling there is 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.630
 never repent
