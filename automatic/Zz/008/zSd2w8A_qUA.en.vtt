00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.470
 Kintaro 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.470
 Masao Hatakeyama 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.140
 1 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:16.139
 Once upon a time there was a strong child that Kintaro 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.650
 Sagami country 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.619
 Born in the back of Mt. Ashigara 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.619
 I lived with my mom 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 Kintaro is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.520
 From the time of birth it is it strong force 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.310
 By the time I am seventy-eight 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.600
 About Tahara of round vinegar or even Minuka 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.600
 I lifted it calmly 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:55.180
 It was not defeated even if we took a fight against most adults 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.880
 If the other party is no longer in the neighborhood 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.000
 It's boring, Kintaro is 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.000
 I ran around in the forest on the 1st 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.510
 And I got my mom 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 Carry a big bag and walk 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.640
 Big cedar tree 8 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.550
 If you cut a pine tree 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.550
 I was amused to imitate Woodman 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.890
 One day 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:33.050
 Stay deep in the depths of the forest 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:38.380
 When I cut a big tree as usual 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.380
 A big bear came out 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.150
 While watching the bear 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 Who 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.960
 I'll destroy the forest 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.340
 Say 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.340
 I was jumping 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.060
 Then Kintaro 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.830

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.130
 Good for the winter 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.020
 Do not know Kintaro 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.640
 While saying 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.220
 Throw out the chopsticks 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.220
 Suddenly I saw a bear meat 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.610
 And 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.310
 Over the foot 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.310
 I threw it on the ground 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.260
 Kuma is in parallel 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.090

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 In the woods 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 Seeing that the target bears were parallel to Kintaro 's family 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.650

 From then on 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.319
 Kintaro is the mother every morning 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.390
 Connect a lot and have me come 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.390

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.950

 Kintaro takes this housekeeper to a companion 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.880
 I wandered in the mountains on the 1st 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.640
 One day 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.030
 Walking the application 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 Before long 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:03.740
 When I go to a place where soft grass is growing 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.740
 Everybody took a leg and went to bed. 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.560
 Mood seems the day is good 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.560
 It was hit 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.769
 Everybody take a sumo 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:25.660

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.320
 In the beginning 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.880
 Monkey and rabbit are working 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.880
 A deer has become an event 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:45.940
 A rabbit catches the tail of a monkey 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.510
 If you try to take it out of the ground floor 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:54.070
 The monkey regrets 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:58.620
 Because I grabbed the long ears of the rabbit and pulled it 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.620
 The rabbit told me that it hurts 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.750
 That's why I can't fight 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.750
 Both did not you get a reward 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:14.650
 This time the rabbit becomes an event 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:21.060
 A deer and a bear worked 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.060
 Deer I have turned over in between as soon as one of the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.270

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.550
 If Kintaro says 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.849
 I regret that rabbits have legs 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.020
 The monkey puts a hand on the neck 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:26.090
 It became a fuss 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.910
 And press the waist 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.729

 I tried to beat Kintaro 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.950
 I just couldn't beat it 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:49.390
 Kintaro wanted to finish 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.070
 Shake one's body 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.139
 And pretend mast 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.000

00:06:53.139 --> 00:07:03.180
 And also bears 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.180
 Everybody has rolled out out of rumbling goro goro earthenware all at once 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:15.990
 To say to you and everyone every mouth Oh meet hurts 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.990

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.320
 After a while, Kintaro 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.310
 It was delicious 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.680
