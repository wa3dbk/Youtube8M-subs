hundred percent finished and they're not
completely<00:00:11.670> happy<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.510> but<00:00:12.720> if<00:00:12.930> I<00:00:13.080> wait

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
completely happy with it but if I wait

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.049 
completely happy with it but if I wait
until<00:00:13.440> then<00:00:13.800> you'll<00:00:14.010> never<00:00:14.160> see<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
until then you'll never see it so I

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.939 
until then you'll never see it so I
promised<00:00:15.660> steph<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> would<00:00:16.379> show<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
promised steph that I would show it and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.120 
promised steph that I would show it and
here<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.260> my<00:00:19.409> first<00:00:19.619> attempt

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
here it is and this was my first attempt

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.579 
here it is and this was my first attempt
at<00:00:20.159> a<00:00:20.369> paper<00:00:20.820> bag<00:00:21.029> mini<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.810> learned<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.470> lot

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
at a paper bag mini so I learned a lot

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.189 
at a paper bag mini so I learned a lot
and<00:00:22.919> I'm<00:00:23.159> not<00:00:23.339> expecting<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.939> whole<00:00:23.970> lot<00:00:24.900> from

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and I'm not expecting a whole lot from

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.339 
and I'm not expecting a whole lot from
it<00:00:25.349> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.819> it<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.239> a<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:28.079> fun

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it so I think it was a really fun

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.069 
it so I think it was a really fun
process<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.009> do<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.399> I<00:00:29.519> did<00:00:29.599> learn<00:00:30.599> some

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
process to do and I did learn some

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.450 
process to do and I did learn some
things<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.499> would<00:00:31.679> make<00:00:31.829> changes<00:00:32.250> for

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
things that I would make changes for

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
things that I would make changes for
next<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> front<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> think

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
next time so this is the front I think

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.560 
next time so this is the front I think
there's<00:00:35.519> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.879> be<00:00:35.910> something<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.539> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
there's going to be something here I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.569 
there's going to be something here I
haven't<00:00:36.899> decided<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.620> yet<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.100> don't

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
haven't decided what it is yet I don't

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
haven't decided what it is yet I don't
like<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:38.969> closures<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.719> got<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.109> like<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> way

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
like these closures I got I like the way

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.439 
like these closures I got I like the way
they<00:00:40.680> look<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.280> they're<00:00:41.910> attached<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
they look but they're attached with the

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.660 
they look but they're attached with the
little<00:00:42.719> Brad<00:00:42.929> and<00:00:43.260> they're<00:00:43.410> too<00:00:43.739> loose<00:00:43.949> so<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
little Brad and they're too loose so I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
little Brad and they're too loose so I
would<00:00:44.879> definitely<00:00:44.910> change<00:00:45.449> that<00:00:45.690> next<00:00:45.989> time

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
would definitely change that next time

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.069 
would definitely change that next time
what<00:00:46.859> I<00:00:46.890> did<00:00:47.100> was<00:00:47.129> keep<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:48.089> paper<00:00:48.420> consistent

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
what I did was keep my paper consistent

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.990 
what I did was keep my paper consistent
throughout<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> whole<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.859> and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.489> used<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
throughout the whole thing and I used a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790 
throughout the whole thing and I used a
power<00:00:51.300> palette<00:00:51.750> pack<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.320> Creative

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
power palette pack from Creative

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.709

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.120 
this one I stole a steps idea of using a
little<00:04:14.310> acetate<00:04:14.790> frame<00:04:15.060> there<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.480> another

tattered angels they're using embossing

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.390 
tattered angels they're using embossing
powder<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.989> top<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.560> makes<00:04:19.829> sort<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.250> like

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
powder on top so that makes sort of like

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.310 
powder on top so that makes sort of like
it<00:04:20.519> an<00:04:20.609> enameled<00:04:21.000> flower<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.540> then<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.260> just

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
it an enameled flower and then I just

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.080 
it an enameled flower and then I just
