00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
that the watch and my phone could not

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.180 
that the watch and my phone could not
connect<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.919> one<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.750> tried<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
connect so this one I just tried to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.379 
connect so this one I just tried to
forget<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.429> device<00:00:12.049> so<00:00:13.280> it's<00:00:14.280> no<00:00:14.549> longer<00:00:14.580> by

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
forget the device so it's no longer by

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.810 
forget the device so it's no longer by
my<00:00:15.599> cuckoo<00:00:15.870> watch<00:00:16.080> profile<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> no<00:00:17.310> longer<00:00:17.550> on

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
my cuckoo watch profile is no longer on

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.509 
my cuckoo watch profile is no longer on
my<00:00:18.029> list<00:00:18.859> I've<00:00:19.859> removed<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> we're

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
my list I've removed that and so we're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
my list I've removed that and so we're
gonna<00:00:23.640> try<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.330> repairing<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.500> not<00:00:25.680> sure

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
gonna try the repairing now I'm not sure

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.660 
gonna try the repairing now I'm not sure
if<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.310> Bluetooth<00:00:27.260> cuckoo<00:00:28.260> needs<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.519> be

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
if this Bluetooth cuckoo needs to be

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
if this Bluetooth cuckoo needs to be
taken<00:00:30.390> up<00:00:30.539> or<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.080> yeah<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.890> just

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
taken up or not but yeah that just

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.580 
taken up or not but yeah that just
forget<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.640> anyway<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.590> absolutely

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
forget it anyway just to be absolutely

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
forget it anyway just to be absolutely
sure

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
sure

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200 
sure
so<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:37.710> should<00:00:37.890> hopefully<00:00:38.070> set<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.820> my<00:00:38.969> watch

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so this should hopefully set up my watch

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
so this should hopefully set up my watch
this<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> watch<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.350> let's<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.309> it
