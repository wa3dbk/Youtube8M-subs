00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
us we can find out the answer to this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.340 
us we can find out the answer to this
question<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.830> three<00:00:32.189> ways<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:33.809> first<00:00:34.079> method

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
question in three ways the first method

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
question in three ways the first method
is<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.510> straightforward<00:00:36.510> brute<00:00:36.750> force

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
is the straightforward brute force

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.049 
is the straightforward brute force
method<00:00:37.160> as<00:00:38.480> we<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.570> aware<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:40.800> gmat<00:00:41.280> steps

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
method as we are aware in gmat steps

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.630 
method as we are aware in gmat steps
carries<00:00:42.540> zero<00:00:42.899> marks<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.219> doesn't

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
carries zero marks so it really doesn't

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.150 
carries zero marks so it really doesn't
matter<00:00:44.910> how<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.840> find<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> answer<00:00:46.649> as<00:00:46.800> long<00:00:47.039> as

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
matter how we find the answer as long as

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160 
matter how we find the answer as long as
the<00:00:47.219> answer<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.969> right<00:00:48.170> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the answer that you get is right so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
the answer that you get is right so
simplest<00:00:49.590> thing<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> let<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.850> all

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
simplest thing to do is to let down all

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
simplest thing to do is to let down all
the<00:00:51.180> factors<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> 120<00:00:53.780> listed<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.050> factors

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the factors of 120 listed on all factors

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.439 
the factors of 120 listed on all factors
of<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.829> middle<00:00:56.190> factors<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.120> 1<00:00:57.840> 2<00:00:58.649> 3<00:00:59.180> 4<00:01:00.180> 5<00:01:00.930> 6<00:01:01.230> 8

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
of one middle factors are 1 2 3 4 5 6 8

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:11.030 
of one middle factors are 1 2 3 4 5 6 8
16<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:04.290> sorry<00:01:04.739> 8<00:01:05.100> 10<00:01:05.790> 12<00:01:06.450> 15<00:01:07.200> 20<00:01:08.159> 24<00:01:08.970> 30<00:01:09.510> 40<00:01:10.320> 60

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
16 I'm sorry 8 10 12 15 20 24 30 40 60

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.870 
16 I'm sorry 8 10 12 15 20 24 30 40 60
and<00:01:11.369> 120<00:01:12.680> count<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:14.070> factors<00:01:14.520> gives<00:01:14.670> us

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and 120 count of these factors gives us

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.350 
and 120 count of these factors gives us
16<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.830> one<00:01:16.830> penny<00:01:17.100> has<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> total<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.909> sixteen

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
16 so one penny has a total of sixteen

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.240 
16 so one penny has a total of sixteen
positive<00:01:18.810> factor

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.670 

second<00:01:23.250> method<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:24.720> adaptation<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
second method is an adaptation of the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.430 
second method is an adaptation of the
first<00:01:25.950> method<00:01:26.130> still<00:01:26.880> uses<00:01:27.390> listing<00:01:27.810> down<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
first method still uses listing down the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.770 
first method still uses listing down the
number<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> factors<00:01:29.160> but<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> reduces<00:01:30.330> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
number of factors but it reduces the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
number of factors but it reduces the
steps<00:01:31.080> considerably<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.010> therefore<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
steps considerably and therefore the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
steps considerably and therefore the
possibility<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> making<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.410> error

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
possibility of making an error

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.730 
possibility of making an error
substantially<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:36.960> method<00:01:37.320> they're

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
substantially do in this method they're

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.430 
substantially do in this method they're
going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> use<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> four-step<00:01:38.580> process<00:01:39.440> first

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
going to use a four-step process first

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.230 
going to use a four-step process first
off<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.670> find<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> approximate
