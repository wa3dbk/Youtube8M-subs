00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
can make choices or is everything I do

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.819 
can make choices or is everything I do
and<00:00:56.100> say<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.579> programmed<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:58.050> best<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> can

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and say is programmed the best way I can

and say is programmed the best way I can
respond<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> say<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
respond to that is to say that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.880

everything<00:01:01.430> humans<00:01:02.430> animals<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.600> robots<00:01:04.170> do

everything humans animals and robots do

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.270 
everything humans animals and robots do
is<00:01:05.070> programmed<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> degree<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> how<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
is programmed to a degree so how much of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.270 
is programmed to a degree so how much of
that<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.110> coming<00:01:10.110> from<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:11.130> you've

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that is is coming from what you've

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
that is is coming from what you've
programmed<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.000> say<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> mix<00:01:13.080> some

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
