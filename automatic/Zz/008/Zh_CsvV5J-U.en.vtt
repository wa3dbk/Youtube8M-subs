00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
they were really close this last year

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.960 
they were really close this last year
from<00:02:49.480> winning<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:51.100> know<00:02:51.250> three<00:02:51.700> or<00:02:51.730> four

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
from winning you know three or four

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.699 
from winning you know three or four
games<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.480> they<00:02:52.630> should<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.959> won<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> in

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
games that they should have won and in

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.120 
games that they should have won and in
the<00:02:54.130> last<00:02:54.310> seconds<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.880> mean<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.830> i

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
the last seconds I mean you know so i

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.650 
the last seconds I mean you know so i
think<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.640> year<00:02:57.940> hopefully<00:02:58.060> they<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.450> turn

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
think this year hopefully they can turn

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.750 
think this year hopefully they can turn
that<00:02:58.810> corner<00:02:59.019> like<00:02:59.290> you're<00:02:59.440> saying<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.890> they

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that corner like you're saying and they

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.949 
that corner like you're saying and they
can<00:03:00.880> make<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> really<00:03:01.300> big<00:03:01.420> difference<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
can make a really big difference in the

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.229 
can make a really big difference in the
pac-12<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:03.400> i<00:03:03.489> said<00:03:03.550> coach<00:03:03.880> william
