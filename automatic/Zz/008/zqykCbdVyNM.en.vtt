open<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:07.000> first<00:02:07.299> one<00:02:08.399> let's<00:02:09.399> play<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.789> video

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940 

as<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.870> guys<00:02:14.019> can<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.440> already<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.769> slow

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
as you guys can see it's already in slow

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.130 
as you guys can see it's already in slow
motion

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.710 

and<00:02:23.790> what<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.030> do<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.510> is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
and what we can do with that is

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.570 
and what we can do with that is
basically<00:02:26.380> do<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.740> feel<00:02:26.980> thing<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.430> can

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
basically do it feel thing so you can

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.880 
basically do it feel thing so you can
hit<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.880> edit<00:02:28.209> button<00:02:28.240> right<00:02:28.660> now<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.020> go

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
hit the edit button right now and go

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.100 
hit the edit button right now and go
here<00:02:30.069> first<00:02:30.250> well<00:02:30.459> 40%<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.690> make<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.020> a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
here first well 40% you can make it a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.309 
here first well 40% you can make it a
little<00:02:32.560> bit<00:02:32.680> less<00:02:33.040> slow<00:02:33.640> if<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.720> will<00:02:34.930> with

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
little bit less slow if you will with

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.250 
little bit less slow if you will with
50%<00:02:36.069> or<00:02:36.209> slower<00:02:37.209> which<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.780> actually<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
50% or slower which is actually the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.130 
50% or slower which is actually the
slowest<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:39.090> 25%<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.180> going<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:40.540> even

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
slowest on 25% is going to get even

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.860 
slowest on 25% is going to get even
slower<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.550> have<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.660> make<00:02:43.780> it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
slower here you have you can make it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.790 
slower here you have you can make it
faster<00:02:44.290> 1.3<00:02:44.770> percent<00:02:44.920> 2%<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:46.000> 4%<00:02:46.270> faster<00:02:47.050> and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
faster 1.3 percent 2% or 4% faster and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.040 
faster 1.3 percent 2% or 4% faster and
you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.640> 500<00:02:49.120> frames<00:02:49.480> per<00:02:49.750> second

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
you can have the 500 frames per second

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.680 
you can have the 500 frames per second
or<00:02:50.140> 1000<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.800> gets<00:02:50.950> really<00:02:51.310> really<00:02:51.569> slow<00:02:52.569> I'm

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
or 1000 it gets really really slow I'm

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.670 
or 1000 it gets really really slow I'm
not<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.020> show<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.200> guys<00:02:53.350> all<00:02:53.380> these

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
I'm just going to show the slow-motion

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.740 
I'm just going to show the slow-motion
if<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.010> guys<00:02:57.270> want<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.300> try<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.600> out<00:02:58.690> just

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the with the video by putting where the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.830 
the with the video by putting where the
global<00:03:09.610> ocean<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:09.880> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> start<00:03:10.330> or<00:03:10.540> or

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
global ocean is going to start or or

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.130 
global ocean is going to start or or
where<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.590> going<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.739> stop<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.610> here<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.989> can

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
where it's going to stop so here you can

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.220 
where it's going to stop so here you can
see<00:03:14.440> where<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.890> video<00:03:15.690> I'm<00:03:16.690> just<00:03:16.959> click<00:03:17.110> here

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
see where the video I'm just click here

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.630 
see where the video I'm just click here
so<00:03:17.440> here<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.800> can<00:03:17.920> see<00:03:18.070> where<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.310> video

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
so here you can see where the video

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.670 
so here you can see where the video
starts<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.360> example<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.840> want<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.320> cut<00:03:20.500> this

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
starts so for example I want to cut this

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.800 
starts so for example I want to cut this
for<00:03:20.920> seconds<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.239> I'm<00:03:22.300> just<00:03:22.480> going<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.660> put

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
for seconds so I'm just going to put

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.600 
for seconds so I'm just going to put
clip<00:03:23.050> in<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> video<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.430> start

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
clip in so the video is going to start

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.360 
clip in so the video is going to start
here<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.900> if<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.380> don't<00:03:26.470> want<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.890> slow

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
here but if I don't want the slow

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.160 
here but if I don't want the slow
motions<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.820> start<00:03:28.060> here<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.450> can<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.900> keep

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
motions to start here I can just keep

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.130 
motions to start here I can just keep
scrolling<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.390> let<00:03:31.390> me<00:03:31.540> see

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
scrolling and let me see

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.420 
scrolling and let me see
alright<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.560> slow<00:03:32.829> motion<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.220> going<00:03:33.370> to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
alright the slow motion is going to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.590 
alright the slow motion is going to
start<00:03:33.610> here<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:33.820> I'm<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.209> put<00:03:34.329> split

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
start here so I'm going to put split

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.380 
start here so I'm going to put split
speed<00:03:34.989> in<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.610> videos<00:03:36.610> ours<00:03:36.820> here<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.209> low

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
speed in so videos ours here is low

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.930 
speed in so videos ours here is low
motion<00:03:37.780> stops<00:03:38.019> here<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.470> if<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.340> want<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.579> slow

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
motion stops here and if I want the slow

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.630 
motion stops here and if I want the slow
motion<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.390> stop<00:03:40.840> here<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.470> can<00:03:41.920> hit<00:03:42.100> speed<00:03:42.459> out

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
motion to stop here I can hit speed out

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.920 
motion to stop here I can hit speed out
and<00:03:43.950> click<00:03:44.950> out<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.610> video<00:03:46.090> stops<00:03:46.480> here<00:03:46.810> in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
and click out so video stops here in

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.340 
and click out so video stops here in
slow<00:03:47.530> motion<00:03:47.739> stops<00:03:48.160> here<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:49.989> do<00:03:50.110> all

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
slow motion stops here so you can do all

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.580 
slow motion stops here so you can do all
of<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.620> stuff<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:52.000> hit<00:03:52.590> up

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
of that stuff and then you just hit up

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.580 
of that stuff and then you just hit up
in<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.220> right-hand<00:03:54.760> corner<00:03:55.590> upper

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
in the right-hand corner upper

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.039 
in the right-hand corner upper
right-hand<00:03:56.769> corner<00:03:57.130> okay<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.180> then<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.930> can

right-hand corner okay and then you can

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.470 
right-hand corner okay and then you can
play<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.290> starts<00:03:59.920> okay<00:04:00.250> slow<00:04:00.820> motion<00:04:01.329> right

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
play it starts okay slow motion right

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.880 
play it starts okay slow motion right
now<00:04:03.239> really<00:04:04.239> slow<00:04:04.780> as<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.049> remember<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.470> put<00:04:05.709> on

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
now really slow as I remember I put on

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.539 
now really slow as I remember I put on
the<00:04:06.160> slowest<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.840> there<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.890> have<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.400> effect

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
the slowest so there you have the effect

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.349 
the slowest so there you have the effect
open<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.820> up<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.299> now<00:04:13.799> slow<00:04:14.799> motion<00:04:15.130> out<00:04:15.370> so

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
open it up and now slow motion out so

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.270 
open it up and now slow motion out so
that's<00:04:16.570> really<00:04:16.900> really<00:04:17.260> cool<00:04:17.440> let<00:04:17.979> me<00:04:18.010> see

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
that's really really cool let me see

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.750 
that's really really cool let me see
what<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.549> can<00:04:18.700> do<00:04:18.850> with<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.329> book<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:22.020> hit<00:04:23.020> edit

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
what we can do with the book so hit edit

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.380 
what we can do with the book so hit edit
let's<00:04:24.760> make<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.300> slowest<00:04:26.110> with<00:04:26.289> 25%<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.430> then

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
let's make the slowest with 25% and then

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.040 
let's make the slowest with 25% and then
let's<00:04:29.110> get<00:04:29.350> a<00:04:29.410> little<00:04:29.770> bit<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.810> flipping<00:04:31.810> page

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
let's get a little bit of flipping page

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.730 
let's get a little bit of flipping page
action<00:04:32.620> without<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.849> slow<00:04:34.210> motion<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:35.470> let's

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
action without a slow motion so let's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
action without a slow motion so let's
put

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
put

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.560 
put
fit<00:04:36.880> in<00:04:37.090> right<00:04:37.300> now<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:38.910> that's<00:04:39.910> fine<00:04:40.150> already

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
fit in right now and that's fine already

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.540 
fit in right now and that's fine already
so<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.930> doesn't<00:04:41.170> take<00:04:41.290> too<00:04:41.410> much<00:04:41.440> time<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.430> he's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
so it doesn't take too much time so he's

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.030 
so it doesn't take too much time so he's
going<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.730> start<00:04:42.880> normally<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.830> then<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:44.980> slow

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
going to start normally and then in slow

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.860 
going to start normally and then in slow
motion<00:04:45.310> let<00:04:45.910> me<00:04:46.000> just<00:04:46.180> do<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.360> again<00:04:46.540> because<00:04:46.750> a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
motion let me just do it again because a

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.490 
motion let me just do it again because a
statue<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.740> screen<00:04:49.080> slow<00:04:50.080> motion<00:04:50.410> right

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
statue the screen slow motion right

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.810 
statue the screen slow motion right
there<00:04:52.890> so<00:04:53.890> it's<00:04:54.220> really<00:04:55.030> amazing<00:04:55.480> this<00:04:56.200> is<00:04:56.260> a

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
speed you can put where the slow motion

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.920 
speed you can put where the slow motion
is<00:05:18.010> going<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.220> start<00:05:18.430> or<00:05:18.670> end<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:19.330> works<00:05:19.630> and

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
is going to start or end it works and

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.440 
is going to start or end it works and
it's<00:05:20.830> just<00:05:20.980> amazing<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.760> really<00:05:21.910> recommend

this application you can obviously share

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.190 
this application you can obviously share
as<00:05:24.880> well<00:05:25.090> not<00:05:26.080> this<00:05:26.230> button<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:27.420> here<00:05:28.420> you<00:05:28.990> can

can put a Facebook YouTube video or more

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.250 
can put a Facebook YouTube video or more
export<00:05:33.400> options<00:05:33.880> but<00:05:34.090> that<00:05:34.330> option<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:35.230> have

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
export options but that option you have

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.980 
export options but that option you have
to<00:05:35.650> buy<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.890> application<00:05:36.640> ok<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:37.630> as<00:05:37.780> you<00:05:37.840> guys

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
to buy the application ok so as you guys

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.620 
to buy the application ok so as you guys
can<00:05:38.170> see<00:05:38.230> it's<00:05:38.650> way<00:05:38.830> more<00:05:38.860> complete<00:05:39.520> that<00:05:40.360> the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
can see it's way more complete that the

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.050 
can see it's way more complete that the
slow<00:05:40.870> motion<00:05:41.110> mode<00:05:41.590> on<00:05:41.920> the<00:05:42.430> camera<00:05:42.640> of<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
slow motion mode on the camera of the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.760 
slow motion mode on the camera of the
iPhone<00:05:43.390> 5s<00:05:43.630> so<00:05:44.290> I<00:05:44.320> really<00:05:44.650> recommend

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
iPhone 5s so I really recommend

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.950 
iPhone 5s so I really recommend
downloading<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.700> even<00:05:46.150> if<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:46.330> have<00:05:46.450> an<00:05:46.660> iPhone

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
downloading a even if you have an iPhone

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.010 
downloading a even if you have an iPhone
5s<00:05:47.320> you<00:05:47.560> have<00:05:47.740> odd<00:05:47.920> loads<00:05:48.670> of<00:05:48.880> modes<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.810> can

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
5s you have odd loads of modes you can

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.280 
5s you have odd loads of modes you can
do<00:05:50.170> fast<00:05:50.740> slow<00:05:51.160> you<00:05:51.220> can<00:05:51.580> put<00:05:51.790> way<00:05:52.570> easier<00:05:53.080> were

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
do fast slow you can put way easier were

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.140 
do fast slow you can put way easier were
the<00:05:53.590> slow<00:05:53.800> motion<00:05:53.980> starts<00:05:54.520> or<00:05:54.670> ends<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:55.120> think

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
the slow motion starts or ends I think

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.240 
the slow motion starts or ends I think
you<00:05:55.450> can<00:05:55.600> do<00:05:55.690> that<00:05:55.870> with<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.080> 5s<00:05:56.470> as<00:05:56.650> well<00:05:56.830> but

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
you can do that with a 5s as well but

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.070 
you can do that with a 5s as well but
that's<00:05:57.370> just<00:05:57.640> easier<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.390> interface<00:05:58.840> is

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
that's just easier the interface is

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.200 
that's just easier the interface is
better<00:05:59.410> it<00:05:59.650> works<00:05:59.830> much<00:06:00.130> better<00:06:00.160> so<00:06:00.880> I<00:06:00.910> really

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
better it works much better so I really

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.630 
better it works much better so I really
recommend<00:06:01.660> that<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:02.110> also<00:06:02.650> I<00:06:03.040> want<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.430> think

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
recommend that and also I want to think
