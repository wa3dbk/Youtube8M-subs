just<00:01:18.750> gets<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.080> butt<00:01:19.830> naked<00:01:19.979> open<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.869> then

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
just gets a butt naked open and then

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
just gets a butt naked open and then
again<00:01:22.350> zone<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.040> wait<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.340> him<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
again zone you can just wait for him to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
again zone you can just wait for him to
clear<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> zone<00:01:23.970> since<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> crossing

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
clear the zone since it is a crossing

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.170 
clear the zone since it is a crossing
around<00:01:25.740> he'll<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.070> between<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.580> zones<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
around he'll get between the zones and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.590 
around he'll get between the zones and
then<00:01:27.890> with<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> other<00:01:29.310> routes<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> left

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
then with the other routes on the left
