another<00:02:38.519> cool<00:02:38.730> feature<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.360> CDM<00:02:39.690> 3600<00:02:40.440> is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
another cool feature on the CDM 3600 is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.289 
another cool feature on the CDM 3600 is
fader<00:02:40.860> start<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.580> what<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.849> allows<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.269> to

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
fader start and what that allows you to

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.119 
fader start and what that allows you to
do<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.690> by<00:02:42.840> using<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.260> cross<00:02:43.470> fader<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.950> can

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
do is by using the cross fader you can

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.039 
do is by using the cross fader you can
start<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.549> stop<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.030> different<00:02:45.569> side<00:02:45.720> decks

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
start and stop the different side decks

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.710 
start and stop the different side decks
so<00:02:46.590> if<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.860> engage<00:02:46.980> faders<00:02:47.580> start<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.150> we

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so if we engage faders start and we

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.930 
so if we engage faders start and we
start<00:02:48.959> playing<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.380> left<00:02:49.560> tek<00:02:49.819> when<00:02:50.819> we're

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
start playing the left tek when we're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.280

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
ready to go to the right deck we can

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.080 
ready to go to the right deck we can
just<00:02:52.590> slide<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.890> fader<00:02:53.099> over<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.970> will

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
just slide the fader over and it will

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.970 
just slide the fader over and it will
start<00:02:54.329> on<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.690> side<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.829> in

start on that side and we can do that in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.150 
start on that side and we can do that in
the<00:02:56.040> opposite<00:02:56.430> direction<00:02:56.519> as<00:02:56.880> well<00:02:57.440> now<00:02:58.440> when

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
