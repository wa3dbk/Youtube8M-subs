really excited about the fuji camera i
got<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.560> one<00:03:13.740> out<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.160> i<00:03:14.790> didn't<00:03:15.270> realize

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
got this one out and i didn't realize

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.470 
got this one out and i didn't realize
how<00:03:15.810> cool<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.440> camera<00:03:16.830> actually<00:03:17.040> was<00:03:17.489> so

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
how cool this camera actually was so

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.930 
how cool this camera actually was so
this<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> Polaroid<00:03:19.410> i<00:03:19.440> think<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.280> z3

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
this is the Polaroid i think it's the z3

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.850 
this is the Polaroid i think it's the z3
40<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:21.570> i'll<00:03:21.660> make<00:03:21.959> sure<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.200> write<00:03:22.440> down<00:03:22.470> what

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
40 but i'll make sure to write down what

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.790 
40 but i'll make sure to write down what
it<00:03:22.950> actually<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.430> down<00:03:23.820> below<00:03:24.000> um<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:25.380> it's

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
it actually is down below um and it's

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.440 
it actually is down below um and it's
more<00:03:26.130> expensive<00:03:26.340> than<00:03:26.790> one<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.120> Fuji

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
more expensive than one of the Fuji

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.720 
more expensive than one of the Fuji
cameras<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> don't<00:03:28.860> think<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.280> much

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
cameras but I don't think it's that much

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.150 
cameras but I don't think it's that much
more<00:03:29.760> expensive<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:31.020> how<00:03:31.230> awesome<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.830> so

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
more expensive for how awesome it is so

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.240 
more expensive for how awesome it is so

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
like my cameras I need to charge it so

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.200 
like my cameras I need to charge it so
it<00:04:38.620> might<00:04:38.770> take<00:04:38.800> actually<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> little<00:04:39.760> extra

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
it might take actually a little extra

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.230 
it might take actually a little extra
time<00:04:40.680> usually<00:04:41.680> comes<00:04:42.100> up<00:04:42.280> pretty<00:04:42.550> quickly<00:04:42.820> but

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
time usually comes up pretty quickly but

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.520 
time usually comes up pretty quickly but
uh<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.670> yeah<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.300> really<00:04:46.660> like<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:47.500> uh

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
uh so yeah I really like that and uh

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.800 
uh so yeah I really like that and uh
it's<00:04:48.160> just<00:04:48.250> nice<00:04:48.640> that<00:04:48.670> you're<00:04:49.150> not<00:04:49.300> going<00:04:49.630> to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
it's just nice that you're not going to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.990 
it's just nice that you're not going to
be<00:04:50.290> completely<00:04:50.890> wasteful<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:51.640> your<00:04:51.790> film

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
be completely wasteful with your film

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.830 
be completely wasteful with your film
the<00:04:52.270> only<00:04:52.750> thing<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.200> I<00:04:53.230> wish<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:55.000> that<00:04:55.420> the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
the only thing that I wish is that the

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.110 
the only thing that I wish is that the
paper<00:04:56.080> was<00:04:56.410> like<00:04:56.620> this<00:04:56.920> where<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.670> has<00:04:57.820> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
paper was like this where it has the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.850 
paper was like this where it has the
border<00:04:58.450> around<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.110> know<00:04:59.170> that's<00:04:59.470> not<00:04:59.620> that

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
border around it I know that's not that

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.470 
border around it I know that's not that
big<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.280> deal<00:05:01.950> but<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:04.360> can

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
big of a deal but I like that you can

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.380 
big of a deal but I like that you can
actually<00:05:04.660> print<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.290> so<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.620> has<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:06.390> fake

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
actually print it so it has that fake

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.390 
actually print it so it has that fake
Border<00:05:07.690> but<00:05:07.990> it's<00:05:08.110> not<00:05:08.290> like<00:05:08.500> thick<00:05:08.860> like<00:05:09.130> this

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
Border but it's not like thick like this

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.970 
Border but it's not like thick like this
just<00:05:10.210> something<00:05:10.450> about<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:11.140> border<00:05:11.500> of<00:05:11.530> these

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
just something about the border of these

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.700 
just something about the border of these
is<00:05:12.280> really<00:05:12.700> appealing<00:05:13.000> but<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.390> love<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:14.050> they

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
is really appealing but I love this they

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.220 
is really appealing but I love this they
pull<00:05:15.250> right<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.520> saw<00:05:15.790> also<00:05:16.270> makes<00:05:16.540> a<00:05:16.870> little

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
pull right I saw also makes a little

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.410 
pull right I saw also makes a little
like<00:05:17.500> just<00:05:17.740> printer<00:05:18.190> so<00:05:18.490> if<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:18.760> like<00:05:19.060> hook<00:05:19.270> it

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
picture and the color the way it prints

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.160 
picture and the color the way it prints
out<00:05:23.100> um<00:05:24.100> reminds<00:05:25.000> me<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.300> Polaroid<00:05:25.810> anyway
