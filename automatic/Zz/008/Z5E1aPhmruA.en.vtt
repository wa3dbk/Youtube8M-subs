up<00:01:12.240> means<00:01:12.479> 25<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.520> when<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.790> test<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
up means 25 so right now when we test it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.490 
up means 25 so right now when we test it
we<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> four<00:01:15.810> lights<00:01:15.960> showing<00:01:16.259> up

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
we get all the four lights showing up

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.950 
we get all the four lights showing up
it's<00:01:17.369> got<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> full<00:01:17.820> 100%<00:01:18.270> charge<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it's got a full 100% charge to the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
internal 5000 mAh battery and so what we

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.980 
internal 5000 mAh battery and so what we
do<00:01:23.340> recommend<00:01:23.640> doing<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.479> charging

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
do recommend doing with this is charging

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.120 
do recommend doing with this is charging
it<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.680> AC<00:01:26.000> USB<00:01:27.000> power<00:01:27.380> first<00:01:28.380> again<00:01:28.680> 78

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it with AC USB power first again 78

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
it with AC USB power first again 78
hours<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> full<00:01:29.549> charge<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.240> after<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
hours for a full charge and after that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.649 
hours for a full charge and after that
you're<00:01:31.950> free<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.220> use<00:01:32.340> solar<00:01:32.520> power<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you're free to use solar power for the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
you're free to use solar power for the
best<00:01:33.900> results<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.710> solar<00:01:34.950> power<00:01:35.100> what<00:01:35.369> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
best results for solar power what we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
best results for solar power what we
recommend<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.119> cycling<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> internal

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
recommend is cycling the internal

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.319 
recommend is cycling the internal
battery<00:01:37.650> four<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> six<00:01:38.280> times<00:01:38.460> meaning<00:01:38.939> fully

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
battery four to six times meaning fully

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.080 
battery four to six times meaning fully
charging<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> cos<00:01:40.710> B<00:01:40.740> power<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.400> fully

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
charging it with a cos B power and fully

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
charging it with a cos B power and fully
discharging<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.810> before<00:01:43.229> recharging<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
discharging it before recharging it and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
discharging it before recharging it and
do<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.880> four<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> six<00:01:45.450> times<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.020> go

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
do that four to six times and I don't go

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
might need 1200 mah to charge so try

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.190 
might need 1200 mah to charge so try
both<00:04:39.380> ports<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:41.240> it's<00:04:41.510> still<00:04:41.690> not<00:04:41.840> charging

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
both ports and it's still not charging

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.930 
both ports and it's still not charging
you<00:04:42.289> may<00:04:42.440> have<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.650> device<00:04:42.950> that<00:04:42.979> requires<00:04:43.250> more
