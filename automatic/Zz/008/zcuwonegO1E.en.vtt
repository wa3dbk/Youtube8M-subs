think of that the very end of 2012 ones
if<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:53.820> whoever<00:01:54.539> but<00:01:54.750> I'm

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
if I'm right if not then whoever but I'm

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.080 
if I'm right if not then whoever but I'm
pretty<00:01:55.920> sure<00:01:56.100> these<00:01:56.280> came<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.640> along<00:01:57.060> with

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
pretty sure these came out along with

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.380 
pretty sure these came out along with
the<00:01:57.240> hyper<00:01:57.689> Reds<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.580> hyper<00:01:59.759> Reds<00:02:00.060> had<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the hyper Reds the hyper Reds had like a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
the hyper Reds the hyper Reds had like a
weird<00:02:00.659> yellow<00:02:01.200> stain<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.039> bottom

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
weird yellow stain or in the bottom

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.520 
weird yellow stain or in the bottom
which<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.090> meant<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.330> retro<00:02:04.170> by<00:02:04.350> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
which just meant that retro by this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.640 
which just meant that retro by this
fellow<00:02:04.770> looks<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.399> Anna<00:02:05.580> died

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.070 

so<00:02:13.650> these<00:02:13.950> are<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.190> ones<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.549> go<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so these are the ones that go it's the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.550 
so these are the ones that go it's the
wolf<00:02:16.260> gray<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.340> blue<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.319> you've<00:02:19.319> got

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
wolf gray with the blue and you've got

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.330 
wolf gray with the blue and you've got
to<00:02:19.739> admit<00:02:20.010> these<00:02:20.250> still<00:02:20.519> looks<00:02:20.700> sweet<00:02:25.340> just

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to admit these still looks sweet just

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.880 
to admit these still looks sweet just
look<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.819> finger<00:02:27.660> they<00:02:28.080> enclose<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> time

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
look at that finger they enclose a time

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.470 
look at that finger they enclose a time
focus<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:32.569> think<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.750> might<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:33.959> focused<00:02:35.480> so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
focus I think that might be focused so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660 
focus I think that might be focused so
you<00:02:37.019> can<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.349> there<00:02:37.530> you've<00:02:37.650> got<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.010> Air<00:02:38.430> Max

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you can see there you've got the Air Max

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.199 
you can see there you've got the Air Max
logo<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.500> you'd<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.769> make<00:02:41.209> symbol

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
logo there you'd have to make symbol

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.199 
logo there you'd have to make symbol
there<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:43.310> like<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.519> way<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.760> blur<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
there I like the way the blur in the
