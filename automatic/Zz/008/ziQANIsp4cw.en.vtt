00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
some of the features of this guitar

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.850 
some of the features of this guitar
you'll<00:00:36.379> see<00:00:36.590> here<00:00:36.890> on<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.150> tum<00:00:38.390> knobs<00:00:38.680> this<00:00:39.680> is

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
you'll see here on the tum knobs this is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.689 
you'll see here on the tum knobs this is
VCC<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.379> voice<00:00:42.890> contour<00:00:43.850> control<00:00:44.510> and

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
VCC that is voice contour control and

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.880 
VCC that is voice contour control and
what<00:00:46.699> that<00:00:46.910> means<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:48.309> in<00:00:49.309> addition<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.150> being

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
what that means is in addition to being

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.610 
what that means is in addition to being
acting<00:00:51.890> like<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.010> tone<00:00:52.340> knob<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:53.630> tries<00:00:54.380> to

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
acting like a tone knob it tries to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.030 
acting like a tone knob it tries to
emulate<00:00:55.180> we<00:00:56.180> turn<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.690> tone<00:00:56.930> down<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.800> tries

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
emulate we turn the tone down it tries

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.780 
emulate we turn the tone down it tries
to<00:00:58.070> emulate<00:00:58.399> more<00:00:59.149> of<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.270> single-coil<00:00:59.899> sound

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
to emulate more of a single-coil sound

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.650 
to emulate more of a single-coil sound
so<00:01:02.860> you<00:01:03.860> know<00:01:03.950> obviously<00:01:04.100> you've<00:01:04.550> got<00:01:04.660> dual

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
so you know obviously you've got dual

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.420 
so you know obviously you've got dual
humbuckers<00:01:06.610> but<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.890> I'll<00:01:09.890> let<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.250> listen

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
humbuckers but and I'll let you listen

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.320 
humbuckers but and I'll let you listen
to<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.759> in<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.300> minute<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:12.460> not<00:01:13.460> these<00:01:14.000> are<00:01:14.149> just

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
to it in a minute but not these are just

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.630 
to it in a minute but not these are just
not<00:01:14.479> normal<00:01:14.869> tone<00:01:15.080> controls<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:15.770> actually

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
not normal tone controls it actually

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.630 
not normal tone controls it actually
tries<00:01:16.910> to<00:01:17.380> Lex<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.590> when<00:01:19.009> we<00:01:19.100> turn<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.460> down

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
tries to Lex it when we turn it down

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.180 
tries to Lex it when we turn it down
emulate<00:01:20.240> more<00:01:21.020> of<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.170> single<00:01:21.530> coil<00:01:21.770> sound

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
emulate more of a single coil sound

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.600 
emulate more of a single coil sound
that's<00:01:23.000> got<00:01:23.500> your<00:01:24.500> basic<00:01:24.950> two<00:01:25.250> pneumatic

the<00:01:44.830> only<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.549> guess<00:01:46.000> damage<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.970> more

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
the only I guess damage and it's more

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.840 
the only I guess damage and it's more
cosmetic<00:01:49.690> but<00:01:49.810> our<00:01:49.900> one<00:01:50.050> point<00:01:50.320> out<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:51.610> at<00:01:51.759> the
