00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.360
 very good guys and ladies I am 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.580
 aisling and this is learn but without 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.920
 study what you want to say first 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.450
 place without good studies without studies is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 a little bit because as I have learned I do 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.820
 without knowing how to read scores without going to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.699
 classes or nothing just good in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 my house I wanted to touch a little and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.100
 well I started it's worth then for all the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.949
 world that you see youtube I guess what 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.469
 You see why you like to play the piano but 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
 I will stick to learn not like me anymore 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.129
 or less well, this is a little bit 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.129
 explanation of the channel 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.330
 we have three series in the channel 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.130
 I remember the first one because it would be 13 0 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.380
 what do you mean from scratch from scratch 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.740
 it's the people who do not know anything about piano 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.990
 they never play a piano but he tells me to fuck 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.870
 how to move piano I want to play the 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.670
 piano but I do not know and I do not feel like it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.729
 learn or class anything because it gives me 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.800
 for everything is that we have from scratch to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.470
 people who do not know anything wants 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.780
 learn then ditties worth only 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.000
 we will work what is right hand to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.159
 start in agreement that we have after 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.359
 then we have 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.429
 two hands these are a series for 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.729
 that you have a little bit of playing the piano 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.439
 in two months one even spent if 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.600
 you want to learn so good any 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.490
 song that another but that is not very 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.369
 complicated because it's not going to come out 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.990
 obviously then we have this that 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.880
 say two man then we started to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.250
 use also left hand vale 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.789
 then we will have two rhythms one for 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 each side but it it will be fairly simple 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.490
 agreement and finally the last series 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.760
 it is left as its indica is difficult that 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.380
 does it mean jal 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.450
 good because the ears is for those who already 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.210
 you have more time like me and I'm going to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.550
 at least about 20 years worth playing 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.010
 piano but without anyone teaching me or 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.440
 score nothing like him 'guaje' he 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.080
 remarked because many people ask me 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.940
 sheet music but if it does not come out I do not know 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.920
 write them so I can not send it to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.960
 nobody and the notice in advance is worth 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.340
 then it would be a little bit the same 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.120
 songs that we have been learning 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.769
 in the other two series wrong but 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.349
 what is a little bit more difficult 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.409
 making it prettier cooler than 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.450
 agreement and nothing, I'll let you watch 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.670
 which is the series that you like the most 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.310
 that you go looking and subscribe to the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.690
 channel an agreement I am ai trimester 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.690
