00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
things like that and now that I have

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.510 
things like that and now that I have
those<00:00:47.120> things<00:00:47.329> down<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.899> find<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:48.860> not<00:00:49.160> too

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
difficult to go 2 2 1 3 2 1 4 2 1 almost

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.049 
difficult to go 2 2 1 3 2 1 4 2 1 almost
every<00:00:53.960> single<00:00:54.110> game<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.590> mean<00:00:54.739> I'm<00:00:55.059> definitely

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
every single game I mean I'm definitely

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.080 
every single game I mean I'm definitely
going<00:00:56.180> positive<00:00:56.690> every<00:00:56.840> single<00:00:57.110> game<00:00:57.230> but<00:00:58.090> but

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
going positive every single game but but

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.970 
going positive every single game but but
my<00:00:59.210> win-loss<00:00:59.600> ratio<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.440> not<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.800> good<00:01:00.920> but

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
my win-loss ratio is not that good but

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.700 
my win-loss ratio is not that good but
because<00:01:01.460> for<00:01:01.670> whatever<00:01:01.910> reason<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.710> mercenary

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
because for whatever reason in mercenary

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.959 
because for whatever reason in mercenary
and<00:01:03.950> like<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:04.100> don't<00:01:04.339> know<00:01:04.519> if<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.729> had<00:01:04.820> something

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
and like I don't know if I had something

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.249 
and like I don't know if I had something
to<00:01:05.119> do<00:01:05.180> with<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> skill<00:01:05.570> based<00:01:05.750> matchmaking

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
to do with the skill based matchmaking

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.149 
to do with the skill based matchmaking
but<00:01:07.329> it<00:01:08.329> used<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.749> be<00:01:08.899> that<00:01:09.109> one<00:01:09.469> really<00:01:09.979> good

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
but it used to be that one really good

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.730 
but it used to be that one really good
player<00:01:10.429> like<00:01:10.700> 1x<00:01:11.209> Cal<00:01:11.539> or<00:01:11.810> one<00:01:12.020> me<00:01:12.259> on<00:01:12.499> a<00:01:12.530> good

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.449 
player like 1x Cal or one me on a good
day<00:01:12.799> could<00:01:13.729> carry<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.539> mercenary<00:01:15.259> game<00:01:15.619> pretty

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:16.459

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.620 
liked that about halo I like the fact
that<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:43.029> generally<00:01:44.029> pairs<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.359> up<00:01:44.509> with

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
that it generally pairs you up with

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.739 
that it generally pairs you up with
players<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:44.959> are<00:01:45.939> either<00:01:46.939> of<00:01:47.329> your<00:01:47.539> same

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
players that are either of your same

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.539 
players that are either of your same
skill<00:01:48.020> level<00:01:48.049> or<00:01:48.499> around<00:01:48.950> your<00:01:49.099> same<00:01:49.310> skill

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
skill level or around your same skill

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.690 
skill level or around your same skill
level<00:01:49.819> and<00:01:49.969> it<00:01:50.090> looks<00:01:50.299> like<00:01:51.279> Call<00:01:52.279> of<00:01:52.310> Duty<00:01:52.609> is

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
level and it looks like Call of Duty is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.800 
level and it looks like Call of Duty is
doing<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.029> right<00:01:53.209> now<00:01:53.329> in<00:01:53.450> fact<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.749> think

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
doing that right now in fact I think

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.959 
doing that right now in fact I think
Vaughn<00:01:54.439> even<00:01:54.829> confirmed<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.609> there<00:01:55.759> was

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
Vaughn even confirmed that there was

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
married or I guess when I'm married it's

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.210 
married or I guess when I'm married it's
just<00:03:42.359> it's<00:03:42.870> easier<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.680> all<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:44.040> stuff

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
just it's easier to get all that stuff

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.580 
just it's easier to get all that stuff
done<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.729> be<00:03:44.879> responsible<00:03:45.599> because<00:03:46.229> you<00:03:46.439> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
done to be responsible because you have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.229 
done to be responsible because you have
someone<00:03:47.009> else<00:03:47.159> that<00:03:47.280> you're<00:03:47.579> accountable<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
someone else that you're accountable to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.949 
someone else that you're accountable to
and<00:03:48.509> I<00:03:49.849> think<00:03:50.849> it's<00:03:51.060> easier<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.419> slack<00:03:51.689> off<00:03:51.900> on

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
and I think it's easier to slack off on

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.909 
and I think it's easier to slack off on
like<00:03:52.290> DMV<00:03:52.859> like<00:03:53.159> registering<00:03:53.819> your<00:03:53.970> car<00:03:54.180> or
