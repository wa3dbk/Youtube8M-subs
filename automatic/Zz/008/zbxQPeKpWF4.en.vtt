00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
Pacquiao loses and you find out that he

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359

busted shoulder or not with Manny I mean
I<00:02:30.340> agree<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.640> there's<00:02:31.270> some<00:02:31.600> sort<00:02:31.750> of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I agree that there's some sort of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.480 
I agree that there's some sort of
nuances<00:02:32.230> about<00:02:32.500> what<00:02:32.830> kind<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> information<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
nuances about what kind of information a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.190 
nuances about what kind of information a
boxer<00:02:33.790> has<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.030> disclose<00:02:34.270> before<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> fight<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
boxer has to disclose before a fight I

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.160 
boxer has to disclose before a fight I
would<00:02:35.560> argue<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:36.300> an<00:02:37.300> issue<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:38.050> your

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
would argue that an issue with your

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.200 
would argue that an issue with your
rotator<00:02:38.620> cuff<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.220> something<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.120> you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
rotator cuff is something that you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.970 
rotator cuff is something that you
should<00:02:40.240> disclose<00:02:40.630> prior<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.320> big<00:02:41.710> fight

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
should disclose prior to a big fight

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.440 
should disclose prior to a big fight
like<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:42.730> nonetheless<00:02:42.940> there<00:02:43.420> was

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
like this but nonetheless there was

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.060 
like this but nonetheless there was
something<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.350> article<00:02:44.650> there<00:02:44.770> saying

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
something in the article there saying

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.130 
something in the article there saying
some<00:02:45.910> legal<00:02:46.300> experts<00:02:46.690> were<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:46.930> there<00:02:47.050> were

some legal experts were like there were

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.710 
some legal experts were like there were
been<00:02:47.320> more<00:02:47.650> lawsuits<00:02:48.610> if<00:02:48.760> they<00:02:48.790> had<00:02:49.150> cancelled

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
been more lawsuits if they had cancelled

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
been more lawsuits if they had cancelled
a<00:02:49.810> fight<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.340> his<00:02:51.670> shoulder<00:02:51.940> issue

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
a fight because of his shoulder issue

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.270 
a fight because of his shoulder issue
than<00:02:52.690> if<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:52.990> had<00:02:53.020> actually<00:02:53.410> did<00:02:54.100> what<00:02:54.220> they

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
than if they had actually did what they

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.800 
than if they had actually did what they
did<00:02:54.340> which<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.580> go<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.420> right<00:02:55.690> but

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
did which is go on with it right but

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.240 
did which is go on with it right but
then<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.200> should<00:02:56.320> still<00:02:56.770> just<00:02:56.950> tell<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
then it's you should still just tell the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.800 
then it's you should still just tell the
public<00:02:57.550> what's<00:02:57.730> going<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.000> with<00:02:58.420> his<00:02:58.510> shoulder
