00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.069
 Russell Carman's recent model Ted gave really interesting about how she was 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.190
 They were very beautiful and model because they often get things done 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.320
 It's not worth it Well it's really really hard for a woman to 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.580
 I go ahead and say it because people will often criticize you for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.000
 They will say that all you get is all just great ... uh the opportunities are available at 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.730
 Life is because you are beautiful but there is not much to it oh ... and 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.160
 And it's quite honest about it actually let's watch a little bit up 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.359
 Here to talk 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.750
 I want to genetic deficiency 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.750
 I am the recipient of the legacy 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.540
 Frick the past few centuries we have defined West beauty tall figures 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.220
 And femininity 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.440
 White skin and this is the legacy that has been built for me and it's the heirloom 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.470
 The money has been withdrawn on 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.100
 So it makes the ruler simply you know 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.640
 There are some things that we get to respond to biology in terms of 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.790
 Purity so symmetry is one of them health 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.810
 Uh ... being truthfully young right 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.730
 The rockets were not part of that equation bordering on participation but 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.410
 Number of years in modern times 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.159
 Become part of the equation because of the community expectations of Saturn 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.810
 Shese like genetically happens to me to be skinny 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.980
 So the machine lottery went up in one 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.670
 I happen to be tall and Paul was silly 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.200
 We have a part of d_n_a_ that has been attracted to twelve women but for some reason 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.510
 Modeling in the world 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.730
 And it's basically because they want to close hang them up in advance to learn 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.990
 In this 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.140
 Uh ... it winds up already made com point 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.930
 The race I thought was really interesting Yeah 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.750
 Say you look you know you have the tire banks in the army and all the stuff on 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.319
 in a 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.419
 Although you know White did not succeed in modeling they suspect them 

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:48.910
 Problems 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.490
 Only four percent of them are minorities and do not let that know 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.930
 Amazing non-blended this is what actually based to say that she did then why u 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.909
 p_h_d_ 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.460
 Uh ... I did not look at this in the 7 600 70 models that have been contracted 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.300
 In 2007 to overseas and only four percent of them do not 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.090
 white 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.510
 Stunning 6 percent currently white 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.270
 While this cell is obviously amazing within the modeling community but also 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.680
 Really want to 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.079
 Props empowers him you know 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.669
 In many things this is not easy to admit it is difficult to do it before 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.639
 A really smart way that she graduated from uh ... Columbia any 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.340
 Graduates of Colombia and any really smart division 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.510
 Uh ... but if you listen to her auctions the entire tent is really extreme expression 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.499
 Your very clever popping can say it works hard but no one 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.259
 Note any of that because first they notice 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 Is the way she looks and says it's unfair because you know she gets it 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.809
 Her TED debate generates millions of visits but you know Colin Powell said in the talk 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.789
 You are well and it's like why people are more interested to hear what 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:56.049
 Amato has to say the opposite of what someone like Colin Powell has to say 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.869
 I think this is very symbolic of what is in our society often we are 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.089
 Get the heat to cover the so called celebrity stories when we come in 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.829
 Celebrity stories for you guys and love you guys I love that you click on them 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.430
 As the station left a comment on it I decided one day we could not try to lay 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.499
 Stamp it and that means we do not cover like every other cigarette if 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.039
 There were minor reserves like that 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:24.769
 Did you see that she misled the heart while she was in it no matter how we did the correction 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.890
 Try to get a point 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.140
 The rate we try to be 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.129
 The reason we try to make a point about community culture and so on 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.379
 Maybe we have not always succeeded but let's go to work but but you can 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.620
 Soak prey to this right article that it was really interesting 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.630
 She stated that Colin Powell was specific because that was to give a speech 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.410
 I got the same time and they quadrupled the number of users who are now there 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.359
 Other factors that Colin Powell sees are often but you know what happened 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.280
 Some of those 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.619
 We got here on offer 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.109
 When you are a big concern if you do not ship 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.069
 Because you know and think that at the moment is that they have a lot is that I 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.979
 I think that 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.459
 It was an instinct 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.379
 It will be interesting and this is a really smart guess, and it really has 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.850
 Interesting point plus it's super hot Keep it real Ait right now 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.760
 Yes please 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.419
 He said in no such way be the reason 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.789
 it's a 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.640
 Class we would not expect 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.969
 Know the ice you expect from 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:23.249
 Political conversation or cultural conversation interesting from 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.449
 Someone from a nation or the Internet or 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.469
 A political figure but since it's a model since there is to 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.990
 Right Right Yeah it rent a 2 second stalemate 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050
 I accept all these offers 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.120
 When it is kind of unfair to ask me why they should be asking more 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.169
 Qualified persons I do not think that without a doubt they should accept 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.009
 Huge offers one wrong belief is that 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.810
 Attracted people get these great opportunities right 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.150
 But often when it's a real objective opportunity let's say like 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.229
 Co-host the example ascites exhibition can get hired well for you based on your fortunes 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.639
 But your thought is what is being heated up that keeps you Michelle on you 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.539
 Can not be a moron in a Costa simulation demo cut a lot better than getting well but you are a man 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.639
 I know what these people often mean to people if on you if you 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.220
 Cable to handle whatever function you take and your abilities will help 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.910
 I was pursuing whatever that uh ... some do not and I have always thought to be 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.610
 It was 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.199
 In August kind of obviously people hired me to look like me 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.409
 And even know what I think I have ever done over these years together even the doctor
