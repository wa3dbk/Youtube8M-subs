this first one obvious if you see a

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.590 
this first one obvious if you see a
target<00:00:28.510> go<00:00:28.690> for<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.880> one<00:00:31.150> is<00:00:31.180> one<00:00:31.570> of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
target go for it this one is one of

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.470 
target go for it this one is one of
those<00:00:31.750> ones<00:00:31.960> where<00:00:32.079> you<00:00:32.289> um<00:00:32.789> yet<00:00:33.789> find<00:00:34.120> all

those ones where you um yet find all

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.000 
those ones where you um yet find all
those<00:00:34.750> little<00:00:34.899> things<00:00:35.020> throughout<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.680> level

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
those little things throughout the level

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.050 
those little things throughout the level
so<00:00:36.720> hopefully<00:00:37.720> seeing<00:00:38.200> this<00:00:38.440> you<00:00:38.680> can

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
there if you can see it up in the right

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.200 
there if you can see it up in the right
top<00:00:55.960> corner<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:57.309> row<00:00:57.520> out<00:00:57.700> there<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.000> jump

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
top corner just row out there and jump

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.500 
top corner just row out there and jump
up<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.390> it

up to it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.180 
up to it
sometimes<00:01:00.290> I<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.740> hard<00:01:00.770> time<00:01:01.010> telling

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
sometimes I have a hard time telling

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.880 
sometimes I have a hard time telling
exactly<00:01:01.910> where<00:01:02.240> in<00:01:03.250> space<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.790> bottle<00:01:05.090> is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
exactly where in space the bottle is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.930 
exactly where in space the bottle is
that's<00:01:06.890> why<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.070> was<00:01:07.250> rowing<00:01:07.610> around<00:01:07.700> in

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
that's why I was rowing around in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.590 
that's why I was rowing around in
circles<00:01:08.530> this<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.680> why<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:09.860> need<00:01:10.070> Serena

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
circles this is why you need Serena

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.030 
circles this is why you need Serena
she's<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.690> only<00:01:11.780> one<00:01:11.930> who<00:01:12.080> can<00:01:12.260> come<00:01:12.500> down<00:01:12.680> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
she's the only one who can come down and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.800 
she's the only one who can come down and
sing<00:01:13.340> underwater<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.090> break<00:01:14.330> those<00:01:14.510> little

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
sing underwater and break those little

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.780 
sing underwater and break those little
crystals<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.120> a<00:01:17.150> secret<00:01:17.690> cave<00:01:17.870> where

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
crystals so this is a secret cave where

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.810 
crystals so this is a secret cave where
most<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.940> bottles<00:01:20.330> are<00:01:23.650> it<00:01:24.650> has<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.010> thing<00:01:25.520> I

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
most the bottles are it has a thing I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.520 
most the bottles are it has a thing I
know<00:01:25.910> there's<00:01:26.450> somewhere<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.900> can<00:01:27.140> get<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
know there's somewhere you can get the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.170 
know there's somewhere you can get the
coin<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.190> you<00:01:28.250> can<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:28.580> grab<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.880> coin<00:01:29.060> and

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
coin and you can just grab the coin and

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.870 
coin and you can just grab the coin and
walk<00:01:29.330> down<00:01:29.540> there<00:01:29.860> but<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.010> should<00:01:31.310> have<00:01:31.580> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
walk down there but you should have the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.240 
walk down there but you should have the
jack<00:01:32.119> character<00:01:32.570> that's<00:01:32.930> cursed<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.100> can

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
jack character that's cursed so you can

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.620 
jack character that's cursed so you can
just<00:01:34.400> use<00:01:34.610> him<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.800> far<00:01:36.800> no<00:01:37.060> why<00:01:38.060> they<00:01:38.390> decided

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
just use him as far no why they decided

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.359 
just use him as far no why they decided
they<00:01:39.020> needed<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.320> put<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.619> coin<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:39.830> I<00:01:40.220> guess

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
they needed to put the coin in I guess

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.410 
they needed to put the coin in I guess
in<00:01:40.550> case<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.850> wanted<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.119> use<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.300> different

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
in case you wanted to use a different

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.630 
in case you wanted to use a different
character<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.140> do<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.350> instead<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.650> jack<00:01:42.890> but

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
character to do it instead of jack but

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.420 
character to do it instead of jack but
you<00:01:43.700> can't<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.990> there's<00:01:45.140> no<00:01:45.259> reason<00:01:45.619> anyway

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
you can't so there's no reason anyway

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.990 
you can't so there's no reason anyway
you<00:01:47.390> had<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.600> look<00:01:47.720> for<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.140> guy<00:01:48.729> his<00:01:49.729> head

you had to look for this guy his head
came<00:01:50.930> off<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.550> for<00:01:52.550> some<00:01:52.700> reason<00:01:52.910> there's<00:01:53.060> a

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
came off and for some reason there's a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.910 
came off and for some reason there's a
statue<00:01:53.360> underwater<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.410> got<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.680> take<00:01:54.800> his

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
but then they turn to one so we have to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.160 
but then they turn to one so we have to
mix<00:02:29.330> them<00:02:29.510> like<00:02:29.930> green<00:02:31.840> obviously<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> didn't

was<00:02:34.250> yellow<00:02:34.430> again<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:35.900> purple<00:02:36.170> and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
something in the way to where you have

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.500 
something in the way to where you have
to<00:03:00.890> put<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.130> away<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.370> jump<00:03:01.970> over<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.330> and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
as some of the other ones where they

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.940 
as some of the other ones where they
have<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.360> targets<00:03:58.140> way<00:03:58.290> far<00:03:58.500> away<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.830> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
have like targets way far away on the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.979 
have like targets way far away on the
wall<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.489> you<00:04:00.000> had<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.239> shoot<00:04:00.420> those<00:04:00.630> those

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
wall and you had to shoot those those

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.290 
wall and you had to shoot those those
are<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.140> little<00:04:01.290> difficult<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.850> think<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
are a little difficult or I think the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.600 
are a little difficult or I think the
worst<00:04:03.480> one<00:04:03.750> was<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.800> little<00:04:05.070> ships<00:04:05.370> that

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
worst one was the little ships that

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.400 
worst one was the little ships that
we're<00:04:05.790> all<00:04:05.880> sailing<00:04:06.360> around<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.930> not<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.260> any

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
we're all sailing around and not in any

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.890 
we're all sailing around and not in any
pattern<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.459> saw<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.510> just<00:04:09.630> had<00:04:09.780> to

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
pattern that I saw so you just had to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.350 
pattern that I saw so you just had to
kind<00:04:10.050> of<00:04:10.170> wing<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:12.060> one<00:04:12.180> took<00:04:12.300> me

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
kind of wing it and that one took me

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.810 
kind of wing it and that one took me
forever

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
forever

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.560 
forever
these<00:04:14.820> were<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.450> much<00:04:15.720> easier<00:04:16.079> after<00:04:16.290> that

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
these were is so much easier after that

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.240 
these were is so much easier after that
anyway<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:18.900> swim<00:04:19.620> out<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.919> get<00:04:20.100> it

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
anyway you can just swim out and get it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.150 
anyway you can just swim out and get it
and<00:04:20.870> there<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.260> target<00:04:22.770> up<00:04:22.860> there<00:04:23.010> that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and there is that target up there that

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.700 
and there is that target up there that
you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.460> probably<00:04:23.669> see<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:25.380> course<00:04:25.590> you're

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
you can probably see of course you're

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.960 
you can probably see of course you're
gonna<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.040> shoot<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.370> why<00:04:26.729> would<00:04:26.880> they

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
gonna have to shoot it why would they

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.100 
gonna have to shoot it why would they
put<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.150> target<00:04:27.419> that<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.690> don't<00:04:27.900> need<00:04:28.020> to

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
put a target that you don't need to

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.450 
put a target that you don't need to
shoot

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
shoot

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.540 
shoot
so<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.210> can<00:04:30.690> use<00:04:30.840> whoever<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.620> don't<00:04:32.040> care

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
so you can use whoever I don't care

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.640 
so you can use whoever I don't care
I<00:04:32.580> used<00:04:33.120> Marty<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.690> don't<00:04:33.810> know<00:04:34.050> why<00:04:34.200> Marty

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
I used Marty I don't know why Marty

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.000 
I used Marty I don't know why Marty
upsets<00:04:35.040> me<00:04:35.220> cuz<00:04:35.430> he<00:04:35.520> always<00:04:35.640> like<00:04:36.740> gets<00:04:37.740> shot

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
upsets me cuz he always like gets shot

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.690 
upsets me cuz he always like gets shot
backwards<00:04:38.660> but<00:04:39.660> whatever<00:04:40.490> when<00:04:41.490> you're<00:04:41.580> going

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
backwards but whatever when you're going

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.220 
backwards but whatever when you're going
up<00:04:41.880> these<00:04:42.030> don't<00:04:42.360> push<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> Ford<00:04:42.930> button

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
up these don't push the Ford button

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.740 
up these don't push the Ford button
because<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.770> won't<00:04:43.980> work<00:04:44.130> right<00:04:44.450> there<00:04:45.450> I

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
because it won't work right there I

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.270 
because it won't work right there I
think<00:04:45.870> what<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.350> need<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.620> do<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.890> get<00:04:47.100> on<00:04:47.190> the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
think what you need to do is get on the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.160 
think what you need to do is get on the
other<00:04:47.520> side<00:04:47.670> of<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.800> brown<00:04:50.160> pole

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
other side of the the brown pole

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.150 
other side of the the brown pole
otherwise<00:04:52.170> she'll<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:52.530> keep<00:04:52.680> falling<00:04:53.040> off

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
otherwise she'll just keep falling off

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.250 
otherwise she'll just keep falling off
and<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.760> didn't<00:04:54.030> realize<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.390> until<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:54.870> tried

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
and I didn't realize that until I tried

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.150 
and I didn't realize that until I tried
it<00:04:55.440> like<00:04:55.920> 20<00:04:56.850> times<00:04:56.880> literally<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.410> was<00:04:58.560> really

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
it like 20 times literally it was really

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.480

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
upsetting and then I got on the other

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.130 
upsetting and then I got on the other
side<00:05:02.730> and<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.060> was<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:03.360> oh<00:05:03.510> look<00:05:03.780> this
