00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.189 
create there and they have to jam away
which<00:05:31.879> they<00:05:32.060> won't<00:05:32.240> want<00:05:32.419> to<00:05:32.569> jump<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.960> because

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
which they won't want to jump it because

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.510 
which they won't want to jump it because
they<00:05:33.289> want<00:05:33.469> to<00:05:33.529> punish<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:33.979> right<00:05:34.009> up<00:05:34.219> there

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.570 
but they wouldn't know you wanna Tek it
so<00:05:36.379> when<00:05:36.500> people<00:05:36.770> realize<00:05:37.069> it<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.400> like

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
so when people realize it is like

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.490 
so when people realize it is like
usually<00:05:38.210> should<00:05:38.419> start<00:05:38.659> off<00:05:38.719> with<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:38.930> touching

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
usually should start off with a touching

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.100 
usually should start off with a touching
light<00:05:39.710> because<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:41.509> opponent<00:05:41.870> probably

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
light because the opponent probably

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.330 
light because the opponent probably
doesn't<00:05:42.409> know<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:42.800> came<00:05:43.009> up<00:05:43.159> from<00:05:43.250> the

can they won't press butter lettuce but
cross<00:06:05.659> when<00:06:05.870> you<00:06:05.960> already<00:06:06.430> kind<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.460> condition

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
cross when you already kind of condition

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.510 
cross when you already kind of condition
them<00:06:08.150> in<00:06:08.389> this<00:06:08.629> way<00:06:08.870> so<00:06:09.529> when<00:06:10.099> you<00:06:10.219> do<00:06:10.370> the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
them in this way so when you do the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.420 
them in this way so when you do the
first<00:06:10.729> one<00:06:11.139> you<00:06:12.139> can<00:06:12.319> even<00:06:12.439> check<00:06:12.770> out<00:06:12.979> laughs

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
first one you can even check out laughs

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.850 
first one you can even check out laughs
at<00:06:13.759> the<00:06:14.479> start<00:06:15.219> not<00:06:16.219> even<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:18.500> know<00:06:18.529> so<00:06:18.830> you

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
at the start not even you know so you

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.469 
at the start not even you know so you
hit<00:06:19.129> the<00:06:19.219> front<00:06:19.430> no<00:06:19.789> so<00:06:20.180> where<00:06:20.360> they're

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
hit the front no so where they're

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.899 
hit the front no so where they're
thinking<00:06:20.750> about<00:06:20.779> the<00:06:20.990> bag<00:06:21.199> or<00:06:21.439> where<00:06:22.339> they<00:06:22.819> are

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
thinking about the bag or where they are

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.119 
thinking about the bag or where they are
coming<00:06:23.060> from<00:06:23.240> cuz<00:06:24.169> justice<00:06:24.500> italo<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.009> have

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
coming from cuz justice italo you have

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.760 
coming from cuz justice italo you have
to<00:06:25.219> block<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.550> front<00:06:25.789> and<00:06:26.000> event<00:06:26.419> ok<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:27.319> it's

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
to block the front and event ok so it's

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.529 
to block the front and event ok so it's
low<00:06:27.979> mixed<00:06:28.339> you<00:06:28.699> can<00:06:28.729> even<00:06:29.000> mix<00:06:29.240> that<00:06:29.360> more

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
low mixed you can even mix that more

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.990 
low mixed you can even mix that more
creativity<00:06:30.050> but<00:06:30.949> I<00:06:31.069> advise<00:06:31.520> people<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:31.819> use

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
creativity but I advise people to use

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.929 
creativity but I advise people to use
the<00:06:32.210> designs<00:06:32.689> of<00:06:32.839> this<00:06:32.990> is<00:06:33.139> more<00:06:33.349> tricky<00:06:33.939> yeah
