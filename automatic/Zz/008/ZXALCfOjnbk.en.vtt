00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.050
 we are in croatia near split for the worldwide presentation of them 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.690
 history repeat the old a comment a motorcycle that since 2003 had a 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.880
 great success this new version the new v strom 650 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.410
 especially the aesthetics of the fairing 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130
 much much narrower. battle at kruger timer of a modern 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.410
 no quarter much narrower reservoir especially in the Chianti area 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.710
 and I was lost 2 liters of battery life but the engine was revised 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.219
 consumes about 10% less so the autonomy and range of action 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.250
 overall remained unchanged even slightly increased 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.320
 also the star is much more 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.100
 ergonomic is more pleasant even in aesthetics 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.610
 but the front we always find the alloy wheel from 19 we would be there 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.450
 expect a more courageous maneuver from suzuki maybe even one 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.070
 version from 21 with spoked circles but the chassis openly based on 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.600
 road use for use 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.579
 tourist 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.669
 he advised foot technicians via mazzini to keep the solution unchanged 

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:15.439
 original 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.130
 for which I look for ground 19 300 mm disc suspension unchanged if not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 in its internal calibration 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.800
 the engine the usual suzuki the twin cylinder lp640 7 cubic centimeters 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.289
 and the same as the gladius 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.829
 revised however in the thermal part 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.479
 are new camshafts 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 the pistons and the tree 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 suction agreements with one 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 he lives at the bottom and also donates a few nailed horses make me part a 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.640
 a little more sparkling 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 even wide open 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 the driving position remained substantially unchanged by virtue of a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950
 chassis that has not changed 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.979
 we find a tank that is much narrower so it allows you to keep 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:13.439
 the legs much more adherent to the very clever dead body the fascia 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.420
 central 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.790
 kit allows being in metal 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.290
 it anchoring a tank bag to magnet putting handlebar is slightly 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.880
 advanced as in all insults road convocation 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.959
 like this 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.110
 there the position of the adjustable saddle of 20 mm lower chrysanthemum 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.630
 allows you to dress your size according to your height 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.050
 compared to the previous version 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.400
 the new one houses a much smaller and more compact cushion 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.320
 this allowed not only to reduce the overall size width 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.990
 of fairing 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.490
 but also to use a + + more advanced instrumentation 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.530
 it's a digital analogue mix 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.780
 there is the light of the bs that on the new v art strom of absolutely seriousness 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.370
 and then there are all sorts of new information that can be 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.810
 consult directly from the handlebar without removing your hands 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.789
 ultimately the new suzuki has a more comfortable riding position for 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.369
 pilots of all sizes 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.860
 has an engine that is linked to the previous one 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.219
 but it was harley 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.019
 I think a little bit more by others 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.599
 even if the 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.169
 you are surely important aesthetics and more beautiful graceful aesthetics 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.169
 per launched 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.409
 really a cataract operation 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.310
 montichiari interviewed honda has a very successful product 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.980
 keeping unchanged the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.469
 strong point ie the technical part the engine is the chassis
