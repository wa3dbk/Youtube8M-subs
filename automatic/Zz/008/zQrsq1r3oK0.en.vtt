00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
making their breakthroughs do you draw
on<00:01:26.610> them<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.030> inspiration<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.869> mean<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
on them for inspiration I mean it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.929 
on them for inspiration I mean it's
great<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> young<00:01:29.520> guys<00:01:29.700> come<00:01:29.909> through

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
great to see the young guys come through

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.260 
great to see the young guys come through
I<00:01:30.210> mean<00:01:30.479> Roger<00:01:31.079> Novak<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.189> Andy<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> Rafa

I mean Roger Novak and Andy and Rafa

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
I mean Roger Novak and Andy and Rafa
they<00:01:33.630> were<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:33.900> young<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.680> started

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
they were all young when they started

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
they were all young when they started
winning<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.759> lot<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:37.140> course<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.860> the
