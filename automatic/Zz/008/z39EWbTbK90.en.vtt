the center of mass for this system where

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.880 
the center of mass for this system where
we<00:00:06.450> have<00:00:06.600> three<00:00:06.899> masses<00:00:07.350> so<00:00:07.560> we're<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
we have three masses so we're going to

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.980 
we have three masses so we're going to
have<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.280> an<00:00:08.370> x<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:09.030> y-coordinate<00:00:09.809> now

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
have to have an x and a y-coordinate now

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.140 
have to have an x and a y-coordinate now
and<00:00:10.290> right<00:00:11.190> away<00:00:11.309> let's<00:00:11.639> look<00:00:11.790> at<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.059> again

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and right away let's look at it again

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.020 
and right away let's look at it again
and<00:00:12.450> go<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.599> know<00:00:12.900> chances<00:00:13.500> are<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:14.009> terms<00:00:14.849> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and go you know chances are in terms of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
and go you know chances are in terms of
the<00:00:15.179> exposition<00:00:15.929> we're<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.470> between

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the exposition we're going to be between

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.680 
the exposition we're going to be between
this<00:00:17.220> mess<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.910> mess<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> Y

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
this mess and this mess and in the Y

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
this mess and this mess and in the Y
position<00:00:18.720> we're<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.650> between<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
position we're going to be between that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
position we're going to be between that
one<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.420> we're<00:00:21.570> probably

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
one and that one so we're probably

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
one and that one so we're probably
looking<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> center<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.920> mass<00:00:23.130> somewhere

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
looking for a center of mass somewhere

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.750 
looking for a center of mass somewhere
in<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> area<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.949> will<00:00:25.949> help<00:00:26.130> us<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.609> we

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
in that area that will help us see if we

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.300 
in that area that will help us see if we
get<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.090> right<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:28.680> formula<00:00:29.010> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
get this right or not the formula for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.359 
get this right or not the formula for

the y-direction the y center of mass

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
the y-direction the y center of mass
works<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> same<00:00:44.910> way<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.710> 1<00:00:46.710> y<00:00:47.010> 1<00:00:47.039> plus<00:00:47.750> em<00:00:48.750> 2<00:00:48.780> y

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
masses so let's figure out exactly where

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
masses so let's figure out exactly where
the<00:00:59.190> center<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> mass<00:00:59.789> should<00:01:00.059> lie<00:01:00.920> start<00:01:01.920> with
