overseer which can be useful for

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.960 
overseer which can be useful for

scouting so this isn't very easy by the
way<00:02:31.090> as<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.510> tell<00:02:31.660> he's<00:02:31.840> got<00:02:32.020> his<00:02:32.250> water

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
way as you can tell he's got his water

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.690

his control sensor tower here pretty

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.740 
his control sensor tower here pretty

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
much in the middle of his base and here

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.680
