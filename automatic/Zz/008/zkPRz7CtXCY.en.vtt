00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.180
 thousand dreams 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.120
 I have today I learned I had 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.409
 the impression of having been totally 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.510
 bandaged with each other as the host of 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.459
 bandits we went out completely 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.709
 gratified with a real relationship a 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.010
 complete complete issue where everything went well 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.180
 summer 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.579
 is it something exile 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.230
 is where we did not want to be 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.489
 post mortem with the team yes there 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.120
 only happy we think about what we 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.010
 could eat 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.109
 yes instead of thinking about scratching the boo 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.209
 let's see how it's done 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.629
 yes we did not see his hearing is that that 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.060
 the session yes sometimes that I arrived 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.569
 times his room was a little efficient 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.799
 it happens there is so it tastes 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.060
 does not happen all the time and I think 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.949
 that you have to trust his 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.539
 instinct and we have no choice there 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.070
 had no choice is that it's like 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.020
 that unfortunately or fortunately it's 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.479
 as if the worst is that we have the choice 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.340
 if he had no choice there would be no 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.840
 not the torture of the error that 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.270
 could do if we did not have the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.770
 choice it would be like that to be good 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.880
 I suffocate in a yoke yes but at 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.389
 the least we could not say first I 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.550

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.880
