00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
bean and it is just a lovely chocolatey

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.679 
bean and it is just a lovely chocolatey
sort<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.409> color<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.909> definitely<00:01:57.270> sort

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
sort of color and it's definitely sort

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.859 
sort of color and it's definitely sort
of<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.249> a<00:01:59.310> Reggie<00:01:59.579> brown<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
of it's not a Reggie brown it's more of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.889 
of it's not a Reggie brown it's more of
a<00:02:00.990> grey<00:02:01.319> sort<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> silver<00:02:02.340> brown<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.630> think

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
a grey sort of silver brown and I think

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109 
a grey sort of silver brown and I think
these<00:02:04.079> colors<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.740> been<00:02:04.770> chosen<00:02:05.310> because

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
these colors have been chosen because

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.570 
these colors have been chosen because
they<00:02:06.390> are<00:02:06.539> quite<00:02:06.869> muted<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.130> you're<00:02:08.280> not<00:02:08.369> going

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
they are quite muted so you're not going

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.330 
they are quite muted so you're not going
to<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.729> any<00:02:08.970> sort<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
to get any sort of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.119 
to get any sort of
shocking<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.379> colors<00:02:11.379> you<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.650> mix<00:02:11.890> them

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
shocking and colors you can mix them

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.559 
shocking and colors you can mix them
they<00:02:12.370> all<00:02:12.489> mix<00:02:12.640> really<00:02:12.910> well<00:02:13.030> there<00:02:13.390> were<00:02:13.450> they

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
they all mix really well there were they

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.199 
they all mix really well there were they
complement<00:02:14.110> each<00:02:14.260> other<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.890> that's<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.060> it

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
complement each other so that's it so it

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.970 
complement each other so that's it so it
really<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.540> sort<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.230> chocolate<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.860> that's

really nice everyday color as you use
every<00:02:23.709> day<00:02:23.739> re<00:02:24.370> which<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.760> called<00:02:24.910> pebble

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
every day re which is called pebble

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.960 
every day re which is called pebble
which<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.140> more<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.620> sort<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.950> em<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.430> creamy

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
which is more of a sort of em a creamy

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.530 
which is more of a sort of em a creamy
stony<00:02:28.860> sort<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.040> Ray<00:02:30.190> round<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.269> is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
stony sort of Ray round so this is

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.030 
stony sort of Ray round so this is
saddle<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:34.090> pebble<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.890> can

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
saddle and that is pebble but you can

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.650 
saddle and that is pebble but you can
see<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.549> called<00:02:36.760> pebble<00:02:37.150> because<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
see it's called pebble because it is

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.020 
see it's called pebble because it is
more<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.080> natural<00:02:38.379> sort<00:02:39.129> of<00:02:39.190> color<00:02:39.459> as

you can see it's a silvery purple where
to<00:03:11.019> put<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.610> that's<00:03:12.910> what<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.120> looks

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
to put it and and that's what it looks

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.930 
to put it and and that's what it looks
like<00:03:13.450> on<00:03:13.750> my<00:03:13.900> hand<00:03:14.139> there<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:15.819> can<00:03:15.910> see

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
like on my hand there you can see

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.050 
like on my hand there you can see
they're<00:03:16.269> very<00:03:16.480> very<00:03:16.840> natural<00:03:17.799> colors<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.910> they

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
they're very very natural colors so they

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.789 
they're very very natural colors so they
all<00:03:19.269> do<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.660> go<00:03:19.840> together<00:03:20.019> really<00:03:20.260> well<00:03:20.560> and

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
all do you go together really well and

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.110 
all do you go together really well and
that's<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.130> raspberry<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.760> they<00:03:22.000> all

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
that's the raspberry I know they all

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.050 
that's the raspberry I know they all
look<00:03:22.329> incredibly<00:03:23.230> similar<00:03:23.560> if<00:03:24.549> I<00:03:24.639> hold<00:03:24.849> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
look incredibly similar if I hold that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.780 
look incredibly similar if I hold that
up<00:03:25.209> that's<00:03:26.019> why<00:03:26.290> they<00:03:26.470> blend<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:27.069> match<00:03:27.370> so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
up that's why they blend and match so

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.690 
up that's why they blend and match so
well<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.359> are<00:03:28.630> what<00:03:29.290> i<00:03:29.319> would<00:03:29.590> call<00:03:29.980> my<00:03:30.489> base

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
well as are what i would call my base

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.289 
well as are what i would call my base
colors<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.540> highlight<00:03:32.349> colors<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.010> i<00:03:33.760> tend

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
colors and highlight colors and i tend

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.690 
colors and highlight colors and i tend
to<00:03:34.359> put<00:03:34.569> these<00:03:34.750> all<00:03:34.989> over<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:36.549> give

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
to put these all over the I to give

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.199 
to put these all over the I to give
myself<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:38.109> uniform<00:03:38.709> color<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:40.000> give

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
myself and a uniform color and to give

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.330 
myself and a uniform color and to give
something<00:03:40.599> for<00:03:41.079> my<00:03:41.349> statement<00:03:41.829> colors<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.280> my

something for my statement colors and my

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.520 
something for my statement colors and my
crease<00:03:42.609> colors<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.150> blend<00:03:43.180> into<00:03:43.630> rather<00:03:44.440> than

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
crease colors to blend into rather than

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.110 
crease colors to blend into rather than
straight<00:03:44.889> onto<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.220> island<00:03:45.579> or<00:03:45.760> straight

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
straight onto the island or straight

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.000

onto<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.510> primer<00:03:46.870> because<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.530> find<00:03:47.769> that<00:03:47.859> a<00:03:47.919> bit

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
onto a primer because I find that a bit

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.000 
onto a primer because I find that a bit
more<00:03:48.280> difficult<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.849> blend<00:03:49.349> so<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.590> one<00:03:50.799> is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
more difficult to blend so this one is

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.319
