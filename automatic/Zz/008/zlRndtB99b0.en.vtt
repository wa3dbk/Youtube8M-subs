00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
mean I could sit down and play

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.020

borderlands 48 hours at a time and it's

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.340 
borderlands 48 hours at a time and it's
just<00:02:55.270> not<00:02:55.420> worth<00:02:55.660> sitting<00:02:55.900> down<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.290> playing

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
just not worth sitting down and playing

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.050 
just not worth sitting down and playing
for<00:02:56.680> 20<00:02:56.770> minutes<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.280> then<00:02:57.400> leaving<00:02:57.610> because

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
for 20 minutes and then leaving because

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.030
