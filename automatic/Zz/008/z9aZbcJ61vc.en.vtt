now that I have the seat up a little bit
when<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> tuck<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.129> inside<00:01:05.549> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
when I kind of tuck it up inside of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.719 
when I kind of tuck it up inside of
there<00:01:05.820> without<00:01:06.090> removing<00:01:06.689> too<00:01:06.840> many<00:01:07.020> clips

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
there without removing too many clips

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.219 
there without removing too many clips
make<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> less<00:01:09.000> complicated<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.659> possible

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
make it less complicated as possible

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.100 
make it less complicated as possible
and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.490> inside<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and then I get up inside of here so the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
and then I get up inside of here so the
best<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.530> I've<00:01:13.650> found<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> take

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
best way I've found to do it is to take

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.740 
best way I've found to do it is to take
off<00:01:14.700> these<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.960> strips<00:01:17.750> release

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
off these little these strips release

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.700 
off these little these strips release
them<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.680> back

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
them all the way and then put them back

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
them all the way and then put them back
it<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.130> again<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.549> they're<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.150> tight

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
it down again so they're not as tight

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
it down again so they're not as tight
that<00:01:22.200> way<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.560> slip<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.920> down<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that way when you slip it down and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
that way when you slip it down and
underneath<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.759> seat<00:01:24.229> they're<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.409> easier

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
underneath the seat they're a lot easier

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.280 
underneath the seat they're a lot easier
to<00:01:25.799> pull<00:01:26.009> off<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.869> pull<00:01:28.200> them

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to pull off you don't want to pull them

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.480 
to pull off you don't want to pull them
off<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:28.950> under<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> seat

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
off and then put under the seat

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
off and then put under the seat
otherwise<00:01:29.939> I'll<00:01:30.150> get<00:01:30.270> caught<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.590> sure

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
otherwise I'll get caught then make sure

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.200 
otherwise I'll get caught then make sure
it's<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:31.979> flat<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.340> possible<00:01:32.400> underneath<00:01:33.030> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it's as flat as possible underneath so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.929 
it's as flat as possible underneath so
the<00:01:33.299> person<00:01:33.600> sitting<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> can't<00:01:34.290> tell<00:01:34.939> so

so<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.220> side<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> seat<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so for the side of the seat this is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.010 
so for the side of the seat this is
where<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> button<00:01:46.560> goes<00:01:47.000> I've<00:01:48.000> taken<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.390> drill

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
where the button goes I've taken a drill

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.679 
where the button goes I've taken a drill
bit<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.470> believe<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> actual<00:01:50.070> size<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
bit I believe the actual size is like a

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.730 
bit I believe the actual size is like a
25<00:01:51.689> 32<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.829> 27<00:01:53.340> 32<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> little

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
25 32 or 27 32 you just take the little

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.550 
25 32 or 27 32 you just take the little
sensor<00:01:58.740> slide<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> down<00:01:59.700> inside<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.439> then

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
sensor slide it down inside and then

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
sensor slide it down inside and then
once<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> sensor<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.719> just<00:02:03.719> press<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.170> down

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
once the sensor is in just press it down

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.050 
once the sensor is in just press it down
into<00:02:04.320> place<00:02:04.500> looks<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.250> little<00:02:05.969> bit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
into place looks like a little bit

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.730 
into place looks like a little bit
bigger<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.110> snap<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.560> place

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
bigger and then it will snap into place

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.339 
bigger and then it will snap into place
and<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.129> come<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.869> that's<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.200> looks

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
and not come out that's what it looks

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.550 
and not come out that's what it looks
like<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> button<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.220> place

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.539 

now<00:02:15.560> we're<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.799> cleaning<00:02:16.099> up<00:02:16.219> the<00:02:16.370> wires

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
now we're just cleaning up the wires

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.309 
now we're just cleaning up the wires
underneath<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.180> put<00:02:17.329> them<00:02:17.420> all<00:02:17.480> down<00:02:17.540> flat<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.049> I

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
underneath I put them all down flat so I

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.949 
underneath I put them all down flat so I
could<00:02:18.560> still<00:02:18.909> time<00:02:19.909> if<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.209> need<00:02:20.359> to<00:02:20.480> adjust<00:02:20.569> the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
could still time if I need to adjust the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.289 
could still time if I need to adjust the
seat<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.319> all<00:02:21.469> I'm<00:02:22.459> also<00:02:22.670> be<00:02:22.849> able<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> slide

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
seat at all I'm also be able to slide

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.349 
seat at all I'm also be able to slide
back<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.719> forth<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.790> right<00:02:25.790> now<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:25.939> just<00:02:26.030> have

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
back and forth and right now I just have

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.349 
back and forth and right now I just have
these<00:02:26.750> wires<00:02:27.079> sticking<00:02:27.439> out<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.269> the

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
these wires sticking out just for the

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.140 
these wires sticking out just for the
ground<00:02:29.629> in<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.840> power<00:02:30.549> so<00:02:31.549> once<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.879> attach

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
ground in the power so once I attach

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.800 
ground in the power so once I attach
those<00:02:32.420> I'll<00:02:32.659> clean<00:02:32.870> those<00:02:33.049> up<00:02:33.230> as<00:02:33.379> well<00:02:37.810> so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
those I'll clean those up as well so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.750 
those I'll clean those up as well so
when<00:02:38.900> we're<00:02:39.019> connecting<00:02:39.409> the<00:02:39.560> power<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.639> have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
when we're connecting the power we have

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.020 
when we're connecting the power we have
to<00:02:40.879> connect<00:02:41.150> up<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.329> a<00:02:41.510> wire<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.280> only<00:02:43.670> on

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to connect up to a wire that is only on

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.119 
to connect up to a wire that is only on
when<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.359> car<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:44.629> on<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.620> right<00:02:45.680> now<00:02:45.859> I<00:02:45.920> have

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
when the car is on so right now I have

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.280 
when the car is on so right now I have
that<00:02:46.370> wire<00:02:46.609> cut<00:02:47.269> open<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.599> little<00:02:47.720> bit<00:02:47.840> as<00:02:48.200> you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
that wire cut open a little bit as you

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.250 
that wire cut open a little bit as you
can<00:02:48.349> see<00:02:48.669> so<00:02:49.669> if<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.849> touch<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.389> with<00:02:50.450> my<00:02:50.780> tester

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
can see so if I touch it with my tester

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.970 
can see so if I touch it with my tester
it's<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.519> going<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> turn<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.439> unless<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.709> car

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
it's not going to turn on unless the car

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.129 
it's not going to turn on unless the car
turns<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.489> now<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.669> car<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.359> is<00:02:59.780> running

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
turns on so now the car is on is running

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.349 
turns on so now the car is on is running
electricity<00:03:00.769> that's<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.209> make<00:03:02.329> sure

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
electricity that's just to make sure

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.550 
electricity that's just to make sure
that<00:03:03.019> we<00:03:03.169> don't<00:03:03.379> have<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.639> running<00:03:04.970> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
that we don't have this running and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.129 
that we don't have this running and
draining<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> battery<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.299> same<00:03:08.659> time<00:03:08.900> so

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
draining the battery at the same time so

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.539 
draining the battery at the same time so
this<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.470> only<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.859> be<00:03:09.980> on<00:03:10.099> if<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.340> car

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
this is only going to be on if the car

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.000 
this is only going to be on if the car
is<00:03:10.669> on<00:03:14.109> okay<00:03:15.109> so<00:03:15.169> this<00:03:15.409> is<00:03:15.500> I'm<00:03:15.560> gonna<00:03:15.739> work<00:03:15.859> for

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
is on okay so this is I'm gonna work for

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.409 
is on okay so this is I'm gonna work for
the<00:03:16.099> power<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.400> took<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.669> fuse<00:03:16.940> out

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
the power I took the fuse out

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.270 
the power I took the fuse out
I'm<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.229> ground<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.859> little<00:03:19.099> round

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
I'm with the ground the little round

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.379 
I'm with the ground the little round
thing<00:03:19.489> on<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.699> end<00:03:19.729> wasn't<00:03:20.060> cutting<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.329> for

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
thing on the end wasn't cutting it for

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.149 
thing on the end wasn't cutting it for
me<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.379> I'm<00:03:21.470> going<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.650> do<00:03:21.769> is<00:03:21.889> I'm<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.099> to

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
me so I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.119 
me so I'm going to do is I'm going to
attach<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.519> this<00:03:22.699> bolt<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.180> goes<00:03:24.129> right

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
attach it to this bolt that goes right

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.729 
attach it to this bolt that goes right
down<00:03:25.190> inside<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.669> there<00:03:26.169> holes<00:03:27.169> connect<00:03:27.560> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
down inside of there holes connect the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.319 
down inside of there holes connect the
frame<00:03:28.069> so<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.340> should<00:03:28.519> be<00:03:28.549> grounded<00:03:28.970> I'm<00:03:29.180> gonna

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
frame so it should be grounded I'm gonna

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.689 
frame so it should be grounded I'm gonna
do<00:03:29.419> it<00:03:29.510> on<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.750> side<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:30.199> we<00:03:31.159> wrap<00:03:31.370> around<00:03:31.639> the

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
do it on this side so we wrap around the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.860 
do it on this side so we wrap around the
bolt<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.060> then<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:32.359> bolt<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.659> in<00:03:32.750> really

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
bolt and then just bolt it in really

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.390 
bolt and then just bolt it in really
tight<00:03:33.169> in<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.739> great<00:03:33.949> way<00:03:34.099> some<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.310> that

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
tight in this great way some of that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.770 
tight in this great way some of that
black<00:03:34.639> paint<00:03:34.909> as<00:03:35.090> well<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.389> give<00:03:35.479> it<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.629> better

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
black paint as well to give it a better

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.670 
black paint as well to give it a better
connection<00:03:36.430> then<00:03:37.430> right<00:03:37.609> here<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:39.560> never

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
connection then right here you never

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.349 
connection then right here you never
want<00:03:39.919> to<00:03:39.979> cut<00:03:40.190> any<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.669> wires<00:03:40.699> all<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.269> way

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
want to cut any of the wires all the way

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.119 
want to cut any of the wires all the way
through<00:03:41.659> so<00:03:42.560> I'm<00:03:42.620> going<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.799> show<00:03:42.889> you<00:03:42.919> how<00:03:43.069> to

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
through so I'm going to show you how to

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.780 
through so I'm going to show you how to
splice<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.489> in<00:03:43.940> without<00:03:44.209> cutting<00:03:44.479> it<00:03:44.659> I<00:03:45.790> made

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
splice that in without cutting it I made

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.939 
splice that in without cutting it I made
a<00:03:46.819> connection<00:03:47.030> right<00:03:47.389> here's<00:03:47.629> I<00:03:47.870> took<00:03:48.470> up<00:03:48.620> took

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
a connection right here's I took up took

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.009 
a connection right here's I took up took
apart<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.340> section<00:03:49.669> of<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.849> wire<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.359> then

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
apart a section of the wire and then

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.960 
apart a section of the wire and then
stabbed<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.799> other<00:03:51.949> wire<00:03:52.190> through<00:03:52.579> it<00:03:52.760> this

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
stabbed the other wire through it this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.929 
stabbed the other wire through it this
one<00:03:53.209> then<00:03:54.169> wrapped<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:54.530> around<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:55.819> will

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
one then wrapped it around and that will

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.289 
one then wrapped it around and that will
make<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.879> thing<00:03:58.879> itself<00:03:59.120> will

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
make it so that the thing itself will

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.490 
make it so that the thing itself will
hold<00:03:59.510> once<00:03:59.689> I<00:03:59.750> put<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.989> electrode<00:04:00.319> tape

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
hold once I put the electrode tape

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.949 
hold once I put the electrode tape
around<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.949> and<00:04:01.069> it<00:04:01.909> also<00:04:02.060> never<00:04:02.329> cut<00:04:02.689> any<00:04:02.870> of

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
around it and it also never cut any of

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:03.550 
around it and it also never cut any of
the<00:04:03.139> wires

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
the wires

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.949 
the wires
there<00:04:04.459> we<00:04:04.549> go<00:04:04.699> I<00:04:05.000> have<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.299> switch<00:04:05.540> right<00:04:05.750> here

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
there we go I have a switch right here

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.670 
there we go I have a switch right here
the<00:04:06.199> high<00:04:06.680> off<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.729> low<00:04:08.060> got<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.139> yellow<00:04:09.409> LED

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the high off and low got the yellow LED

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.720 
the high off and low got the yellow LED
in<00:04:10.040> that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
in that

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.780

which<00:04:11.390> one<00:04:11.569> it<00:04:11.659> is<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:12.370> got<00:04:13.370> all<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.580> wires

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
which one it is I got all the wires

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.689 
which one it is I got all the wires
tucked<00:04:14.239> up<00:04:14.390> underneath<00:04:15.100> zip<00:04:16.100> tied<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> top

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
of the frame of the seat just making

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.030 
of the frame of the seat just making
sure<00:04:18.079> that<00:04:18.169> when<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.320> slide<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.680> seat<00:04:18.859> back<00:04:19.010> and

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
sure that when I slide the seat back and

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.550 
sure that when I slide the seat back and
forth<00:04:19.660> we<00:04:20.660> never<00:04:20.840> have<00:04:21.019> any<00:04:21.049> problems<00:04:21.470> with
