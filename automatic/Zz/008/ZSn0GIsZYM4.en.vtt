00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the one thing that they changed was the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.509 
the one thing that they changed was the
piston<00:03:45.989> made<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> little<00:03:47.070> bit<00:03:47.190> lighter<00:03:47.400> and

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
piston made it a little bit lighter and

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.770 
piston made it a little bit lighter and
