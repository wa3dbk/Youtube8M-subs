dairy tank and what we have here at
Colorado<00:00:09.510> boy<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:11.750> about<00:00:12.750> 150<00:00:13.380> gallon<00:00:13.769> dairy

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
Colorado boy is a about 150 gallon dairy

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180 
Colorado boy is a about 150 gallon dairy
tank<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.450> if<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.289> look<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.859> did<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> we

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
tank and if you look what we did is we

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.750 
tank and if you look what we did is we
extended<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.240> sides<00:00:18.619> for<00:00:19.619> an<00:00:19.740> extra<00:00:19.949> 250

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
extended the sides for an extra 250

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870 
extended the sides for an extra 250
bucks<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> inside<00:00:22.880> there's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
bucks and then on the inside there's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
bucks and then on the inside there's
really<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.180> much<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.710> it's

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
really not much to it it's just a it's

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.929 
really not much to it it's just a it's
just<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.369> opening

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
just an opening

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
just an opening
it<00:00:27.539> was<00:00:27.750> jacked<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:28.859> scratches<00:00:29.279> on

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
it was jacked I see some scratches on

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
it was jacked I see some scratches on
the<00:00:29.760> bottom<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.630> wouldn't<00:00:31.140> use<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the bottom so I wouldn't use this for a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.000 
the bottom so I wouldn't use this for a
fermenter<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.399> anything<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:34.079> Mastan<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
fermenter or anything but for Mastan it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.299 
fermenter or anything but for Mastan it
works<00:00:35.160> great<00:00:35.780> what<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> discovered<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.739> going

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
works great what it discovered was going

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
works great what it discovered was going
back<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.790> old<00:00:39.329> home<00:00:39.750> brew<00:00:40.050> method<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:42.559> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
back to the old home brew method of a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.369 
back to the old home brew method of a
false<00:00:44.100> bottom<00:00:44.629> which<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.660> basically<00:00:46.260> just

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
false bottom which is basically just

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.430 
false bottom which is basically just
some<00:00:47.340> copper<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> had<00:00:48.059> leftover<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.930> put

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
some copper I had leftover when we put

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
some copper I had leftover when we put
the<00:00:49.649> plumbing<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:52.789> just<00:00:53.789> cutting

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the plumbing and then just cutting

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.790 
the plumbing and then just cutting
weezing<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> hacksaw<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.860> cutting<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:57.800> slice

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
weezing a hacksaw and cutting a slice

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.970 
weezing a hacksaw and cutting a slice
every<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.730> inch<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> putting<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.170> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
every one inch and putting it in this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.219 
every one inch and putting it in this
will<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.430> fit<00:01:03.000> into<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> bottom<00:01:03.989> there

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
will actually fit into the bottom there

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:16.240 
will actually fit into the bottom there
and<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> let<00:01:06.150> me<00:01:06.240> show<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.570 

something<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.340> simple<00:01:17.370> as<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
something as simple as that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.470 
something as simple as that
will<00:01:20.580> give<00:01:20.730> us<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> most<00:01:21.210> amazing<00:01:23.270> clarity<00:01:24.270> in

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
will give us the most amazing clarity in

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.350 
will give us the most amazing clarity in
our<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:25.170> our<00:01:25.320> mass<00:01:25.530> runoff<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.430> mean<00:01:27.030> I've<00:01:27.150> had

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
our in our mass runoff I mean I've had

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.950 
our in our mass runoff I mean I've had
better

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
better

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.910 
better
he'd<00:01:28.340> better<00:01:29.340> mass<00:01:29.940> times<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:31.170> V<00:01:31.380> wire<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
he'd better mass times with V wire and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.310 
he'd better mass times with V wire and
all<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:33.060> works<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.600> well<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.170> don't

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
all that but this works so well I don't

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.310 
all that but this works so well I don't
even<00:01:34.500> fall<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.980> anymore<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.080> we're<00:01:37.080> gonna<00:01:37.200> be

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
even fall off anymore and we're gonna be

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
even fall off anymore and we're gonna be
brewing<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> stout<00:01:38.070> today<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.520> it'll<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.940> real

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
brewing a stout today so it'll be real

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300 
brewing a stout today so it'll be real
hard<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.420> show<00:01:39.660> you<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.930> clarity<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.130> work

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
hard to show you the clarity of the work

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
hard to show you the clarity of the work
but<00:01:43.220> but<00:01:44.220> you'll<00:01:44.550> kind<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.150> get<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.330> an<00:01:46.200> idea<00:01:46.410> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
but but you'll kind of get a an idea of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.040 
but but you'll kind of get a an idea of
how<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.980> works<00:01:47.190> anyway<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> basically

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
how it works anyway this is basically

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.620 
how it works anyway this is basically
all<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.320> for<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> mash<00:01:52.590> tun<00:01:53.630> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
all we have for a for a mash tun you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.950 
all we have for a for a mash tun you
know<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:55.080> simple<00:01:55.440> setup<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.780> pick

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
know very simple setup you can pick

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.410 
know very simple setup you can pick
these<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.010> said<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.220> paid<00:01:59.460> 500<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.300> this

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
these up like I said I paid 500 for this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.070 
these up like I said I paid 500 for this
one<00:02:00.660> but<00:02:00.900> I've<00:02:01.050> seen<00:02:01.290> them<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.430> for

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
one but I've seen them you know for

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.240 
one but I've seen them you know for
fifteen<00:02:04.080> hundred<00:02:04.410> dollars<00:02:04.830> two<00:02:05.220> hundred

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
fifteen hundred dollars two hundred

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
fifteen hundred dollars two hundred
dollars<00:02:06.030> they're<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.390> over<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.780> place

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
dollars they're all over the place

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.969 
dollars they're all over the place
usually<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> 200<00:02:10.649> gallon<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
usually what you see is a 200 gallon to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.800 
usually what you see is a 200 gallon to
a<00:02:11.010> 300<00:02:11.580> gallon<00:02:11.700> they're<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.390> bit<00:02:12.570> longer

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
a 300 gallon they're a little bit longer

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.250 
a 300 gallon they're a little bit longer
they're<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:13.620> six<00:02:13.950> foot<00:02:14.220> by<00:02:14.430> three<00:02:14.700> foot<00:02:14.730> wide

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
they're like six foot by three foot wide

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.050 
they're like six foot by three foot wide
or<00:02:16.260> four<00:02:16.650> foot<00:02:16.830> wide<00:02:16.860> by<00:02:17.340> three<00:02:17.610> foot<00:02:17.820> high<00:02:18.620> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
or four foot wide by three foot high and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.490 
or four foot wide by three foot high and
then<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.480> add<00:02:21.660> any<00:02:21.989> size<00:02:22.260> or
