the fifth string 1 2 3 4 5 whereas with

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.089 
the fifth string 1 2 3 4 5 whereas with
this<00:00:29.759> one<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.329> open<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.750> power<00:00:31.050> cord<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.890> few

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
this one the open a power cord first few

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.860 
this one the open a power cord first few
is<00:00:32.189> down<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.519> string<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.210> string<00:00:33.510> 4

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
is down the string it's now in string 4

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.390 
is down the string it's now in string 4
1<00:00:34.860> 2<00:00:35.190> 3<00:00:35.339> 4<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.809> 4th<00:00:37.140> string<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.250> in

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
1 2 3 4 so it's 4th string and it's in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.210 
1 2 3 4 so it's 4th string and it's in
the<00:00:38.519> second<00:00:38.970> fresh<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:40.170> two<00:00:40.440> three<00:00:40.800> four<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
the second fresh one two three four so

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.740 
the second fresh one two three four so
it's<00:00:41.280> basically<00:00:41.519> it<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.629> you're

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it's basically it now when you're

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's basically it now when you're
playing<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.280> try<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.519> to<00:00:44.670> hit<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
playing that and you try not to hit the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.299 
playing that and you try not to hit the
thickest<00:00:45.540> string<00:00:45.839> too<00:00:46.140> much<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.949> ok<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
thickest string too much but it's ok it

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
thickest string too much but it's ok it
is<00:00:47.430> papyrus<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.359> then<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> hear<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> fifth

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
is papyrus and then you hear the fifth

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.229 
is papyrus and then you hear the fifth
string<00:00:50.600> then<00:00:51.600> hit<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> fourth<00:00:52.140> string<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
string then hit the fourth string and

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.669 
string then hit the fourth string and
then<00:00:54.239> again<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.899> first<00:00:55.140> finger<00:00:55.350> should<00:00:55.559> be

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
then again the first finger should be

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.650 
then again the first finger should be
leaning<00:00:56.039> flat<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.579> resting<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.359> strings

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
leaning flat a resting on the strings

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
leaning flat a resting on the strings
underneath<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.769> basically<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> string<00:00:59.489> 3<00:01:00.410> 2<00:01:01.410> 1

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
underneath so basically the string 3 2 1

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:15.560 
underneath so basically the string 3 2 1
there<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> muses<00:01:03.600> ok<00:01:04.970> string<00:01:05.970> 5<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:07.399> muse

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.360 

next<00:01:16.570> power<00:01:16.780> cord<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.680> Parker<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
next power cord we have is Parker to the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.290 
next power cord we have is Parker to the
3rd<00:01:18.610> fret<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.480> a<00:01:19.600> string<00:01:19.980> so<00:01:20.980> we<00:01:21.760> go<00:01:21.910> first

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
3rd fret of the a string so we go first

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.770 
3rd fret of the a string so we go first
Marik<00:01:22.690> one<00:01:22.930> two<00:01:23.440> three<00:01:23.470> third<00:01:24.310> fresh<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.910> this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
Marik one two three third fresh and this

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.720 
Marik one two three third fresh and this
time<00:01:26.050> instead<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.010> being<00:01:27.040> on<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.400> thickest

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
time instead of it being on the thickest

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.340 
time instead of it being on the thickest
string<00:01:28.000> like<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.360> did<00:01:28.510> it<00:01:28.660> on<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.840> e<00:01:28.870> power

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
string like we did it on the e power

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.500 
string like we did it on the e power
cords<00:01:29.680> it's<00:01:30.100> now<00:01:30.340> on<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.910> fifth<00:01:31.150> strikes<00:01:31.390> are

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
cords it's now on the fifth strikes are

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.170 
cords it's now on the fifth strikes are
going<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.690> moves<00:01:31.840> down<00:01:32.110> low<00:01:32.350> okay<00:01:33.070> then<00:01:33.910> you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
going to moves down low okay then you

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.300 
going to moves down low okay then you
still<00:01:34.450> leave<00:01:34.690> hold<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.440> fella<00:01:35.800> then

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
still leave hold on to that fella then

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.880 
still leave hold on to that fella then
you<00:01:36.880> always<00:01:37.090> leave<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.390> fret<00:01:37.630> gap<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:38.170> then

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
you always leave the fret gap and then

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.380 
you always leave the fret gap and then
your<00:01:38.980> next<00:01:39.070> finger<00:01:39.340> third<00:01:39.670> finger<00:01:39.940> comes<00:01:40.210> in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
your next finger third finger comes in

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.810 
your next finger third finger comes in
then<00:01:40.570> on<00:01:40.780> fret<00:01:41.110> number<00:01:41.470> five<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.580> time

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
then on fret number five and this time

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.420 
then on fret number five and this time
it<00:01:43.060> will<00:01:43.150> be<00:01:43.210> unstring<00:01:43.780> for<00:01:46.860> okay<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.310> you'll

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
it will be unstring for okay so you'll

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.970 
it will be unstring for okay so you'll
basically<00:01:48.580> hear<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> or<00:01:49.270> fifth<00:01:49.540> string<00:01:49.980> in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
basically hear the a or fifth string in

this guy on the deer fourth string and
then<00:01:54.130> again<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.520> first<00:01:54.790> few<00:01:55.000> should<00:01:55.180> be

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
then again the first few should be

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.990 
then again the first few should be
leaning<00:01:55.570> flash<00:01:56.460> using<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.550> rest<00:01:57.760> on<00:01:57.940> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
leaning flash using a rest on the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.110 
leaning flash using a rest on the
strings<00:01:58.300> underneath<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.230> here<00:02:00.120> 35<00:02:01.650> used<00:02:03.120> 5th

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
strings underneath so here 35 used 5th

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.359 
strings underneath so here 35 used 5th
string<00:02:04.479> 4th<00:02:05.350> string<00:02:05.820> yes<00:02:06.820> okay<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.649> third

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.950 
string 4th string yes okay the third
fret<00:02:09.610> power<00:02:09.880> cord<00:02:10.119> we<00:02:10.179> have<00:02:10.300> an<00:02:10.420> EU<00:02:10.660> ones<00:02:10.840> is

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
fret power cord we have an EU ones is

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.240 
fret power cord we have an EU ones is
basically<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.380> same<00:02:11.410> thing<00:02:11.560> was<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.010> up<00:02:12.130> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
basically the same thing was just up a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.000 
basically the same thing was just up a
string<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.240> had<00:02:13.420> thicker<00:02:14.050> string<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.710> 5th

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
string so you had thicker string and 5th

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.240 
string so you had thicker string and 5th
string

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
string

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.340 
string
okay<00:02:17.790> whereas<00:02:18.450> ra.one<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.050> new<00:02:19.200> what

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
okay whereas ra.one this new what

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.420 
okay whereas ra.one this new what
everything<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.770> basically<00:02:20.070> down<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
everything is just basically down the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.910 
everything is just basically down the
string<00:02:22.610> okay<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.630> count<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.080> well<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.740> get

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
string okay if you count as well you get

so<00:04:33.360> don't<00:04:33.479> press<00:04:33.720> too<00:04:33.750> hard<00:04:33.990> which<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:34.830> kind<00:04:35.010> of

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
so don't press too hard which is kind of

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.770 
so don't press too hard which is kind of
glide<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.490> fingers<00:04:35.760> backs<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.240> forwards<00:04:36.630> and

glide the fingers backs and forwards and

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
glide the fingers backs and forwards and
see<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> way<00:04:37.169> i'm<00:04:37.560> basically<00:04:37.919> hold<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.310> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
see the way i'm basically hold in the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.420 
see the way i'm basically hold in the
same<00:04:38.610> shape<00:04:39.140> ok<00:04:40.140> what<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.770> don't<00:04:41.039> want<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.310> do

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
same shape ok what you don't want to do

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.909 
same shape ok what you don't want to do
is<00:04:41.550> play<00:04:41.580> one<00:04:42.030> of<00:04:42.060> them<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:43.289> they<00:04:43.500> kind<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.770> go

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
is play one of them and they kind of go

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.860 
is play one of them and they kind of go
lifting<00:04:44.580> off<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:45.060> then<00:04:45.180> find<00:04:45.390> an<00:04:45.479> accent

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
lifting off and then find an accent

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.690 
lifting off and then find an accent
cause<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.680> kind<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:46.860> takes<00:04:47.039> too<00:04:47.280> long<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.669> know

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
cause it kind of takes too long you know

cause it kind of takes too long you know
and<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:47.970> sound<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.240> want<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.479> be<00:04:48.539> able<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.720> go

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
and a sound you want to be able to go

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.400
