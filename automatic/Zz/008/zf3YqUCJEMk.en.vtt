will leave their franchise behind even

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
will leave their franchise behind even
after<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> mixed<00:01:51.299> reception<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.930> last

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's possible that the next big resident

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.200 
it's possible that the next big resident
could<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.320> an<00:01:58.530> unnumbered<00:01:58.979> spin-off<00:01:59.610> letting

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
Silent Hill games before but yeah maybe

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.970

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
it could turn out to be good

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.500 
it could turn out to be good
for<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.340> PlayStation<00:06:36.820> 4<00:06:37.000> so<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.600> 13<00:06:38.020> game<00:06:38.290> and

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
icon it will be interesting to see how

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.820

it<00:06:52.450> makes<00:06:52.630> use<00:06:52.990> of<00:06:53.020> the<00:06:53.380> controller's

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
it makes use of the controller's

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.950 
it makes use of the controller's
touchpad<00:06:54.310> or<00:06:54.520> the<00:06:54.940> new<00:06:55.060> camera<00:06:55.420> I<00:06:55.570> think<00:06:55.870> this

touchpad or the new camera I think this

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.350 
touchpad or the new camera I think this
is<00:06:56.020> probably<00:06:56.260> going<00:06:56.530> to<00:06:56.620> be<00:06:56.710> one<00:06:56.920> of<00:06:57.070> the<00:06:57.360> newer

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360
