00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:10.170
 to all that such I am patrios of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
 welcome once again to the channel I'm going to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.470
 be here in the channel and how you have 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.690
 seen in the title is a new 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.519
 collaboration that I do with my friend adri 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.929
 from channel adri qa 7 that I will leave you here 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.999
 up the link so you can visit it 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.249
 I proposed some days are to perform 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:26.070
 tip joints that is called book partner 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.109
 chat and here is that inundate of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.359
 imagine myself with the books and the day of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.669
 today I come to ask you some questions 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 my friend part of which are eight 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 questions about books and two personal 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.539
 give me the question that the book considers 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.769
 that has left you a great teaching 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.850
 this question is quite curious because 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.739
 there have been many books that have 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.480
 left some kind of wisdom some 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.320
 teaching that I can use in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 future 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.949
 well I will say that any of the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.989
 tales of brothers grimm has been 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.820
 very shocking in my childhood and now 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.140
 also when I am older 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.699
 truth is that I enjoy them because every 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 story although it seems like a story 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 children can all be extracted one 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.940
 morals were not two books to consider 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.440
 that is overrated from my point of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
 I think that in addition to talking about a 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.170
 overrated book good a saga of 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 overrated books 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.439
 I also want to talk about an author who 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 from my point of view 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 overrated and that would be lauren kate and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.100
 his dark saga that I have 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.899
 exactly there I have started the book 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.850
 of dark on several occasions I have not 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.340
 finished yet and the truth is that no 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.289
 I ended up hooking the story 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 lauren's way of writing that I read 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.490
 a few months ago or a month ago I did not 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 according to the last tear that is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.369
 the new volume that they have taken out of their new 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 saga and the truth is that I did not like it for 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.610
 nothing so for me for example the saga 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.259
 dark that everyone seems to have 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.750
 read and that there are very diverse opinions 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.850
 there are people who love it or not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.560
 he likes for nothing I would be think of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.420
 the seconds although I can not judge it 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 because I have not measured it yet 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.250
 first volume number 3 never forgives you 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 like to have a conversation this 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.039
 question is quite complicated because 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.479
 there's one thing that happens to me is that if the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.190
 novel I liked it means that 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.450
 I caught some of the characters 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.459
 honey, I've felt identified 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.289
 with him then he would have a great 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.090
 number of people with whom to be able 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.890
 talk and have to talk but I'm going to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.049
 choose a single character and that's what 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 that it cost me and it would be richard 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.340
 castle that I have it here from the novels 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.340
 by richard castle for a simple reason 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.629
 I think he's a very funny person 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.250
 with which you could maintain a 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.769
 conversation and at the same time passing it 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.140
 alright so I think we would make a dinner 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.750
 together with night out and it would be very 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.819
 very very funny 4 that you would like 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.379
 star in this thought question 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.970
 quite because my first answer 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.200
 would have been any of the novels of 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.790
 filled have pride and pride 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.530
 prejudice but as always I am 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.030
 mentioning full I will change a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.650
 little to you to star in a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.720
 juvenile contemporary novel in the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.400
 find the typical perfect boy 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.200
 from which it is impossible not to fall in love and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.879
 he falls in love with me but not with that 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.310
 love at first sight that I do not like 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.750
 of the novels but be a little love 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.190
 little to be consolidated and that 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.180
 many things happen to us 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.920
 we will do I wanted to star in a novel 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.870
 of this genre because most of the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.700
 cases and in most cases that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.769
 not all cases the endings 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.239
 impressions be happy and I then girls 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.040
 I am a classic and I really like the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.629
 happy endings I do not like the finals 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 open leaving the authors to 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.930
 the reader imagine what he wants but 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.459
 I want to leave things very 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.900
 well tied and I really like the final 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.030
 experiences and those that I have to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.799
 arrive because they have not finished together because 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.209
 I do not like them so I would end up very 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.560
 well with the guy that he was 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.850
 starring in this story do me the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.340
 5 what elegant would like it to be 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.680
 or a movie case chosen that is a 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.210
 movie and it's the red pyramid of rick 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.340
 riordan which is the first part of the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.630
 chronicles that we already know that the saga 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.460
 of Heroes of Olympus by Percy Jackson 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.870
 also since jordan is still 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.330
 adapted the big screen with its two 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.010
 first novels but I want this 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.960
 another out of rick riordan is also 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.950
 adapt because very simple as I have 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.480
 mentioned in some videos 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.160
 I'm a big fan of 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.720
 Egyptian mythology and I think this 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.000
 movie has some great ingredients 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.500
 to be perfect about everything the subject of 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.330
 the special effects I think it would be 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.610
 very interesting to see how to adapt this 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.960
 movie to the big screen number 6 that 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.360
 is what I hate most is that it happens 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.240
 monitors how they always put is 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.910
 a story and you say it helps you 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.970
 put either a love triangle or 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.440
 there is some kind of clichÃ© more or less 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.690
 but I 'm going to tell you those things that 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.010
 I do not like to see at all in a book is 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.200
 a moment in which the boy and the girl 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.670
 they look at each other for the first time and fall in love 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.500
 completely an eternal love 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.420
 unconditional that does not finish me 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.130
 convince because it is not justified 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.380
 does it mean a romance has to 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.440
 start you have a gestation period 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.390
 so to speak 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.490
 falling in love a crush at first 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.840
 view is something that I do not believe anything 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.850
 I do not like to find novels 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.140
 it's the absence of script twists what 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.610
 makes a novel interesting is that 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.470
 as the history of 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.140
 suddenly something happens that changes 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.730
 radically the narrative is to say that 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.650
 you change a lot the schemes of what 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.970
 you were thinking about the novel and that's 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.470
 what makes someone surprised 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.690
 as a reader and that's what I like 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.460
 so a novel without script twists is 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.320
 practically linear and it does not finish me 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.820
 convince me to throw before which is the book 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.560
 that everyone has read but I take 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.810
 bradley not a book that seems valid 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.730
 everyone except me is the first 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.410
 tome of the two books of george rr 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.180
 martin that is game of thrones in this 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.890
 case the truth is that I proposed 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.120
 as a challenge for this month I do not know if it's going to 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.150
 give time because it's a very fat book 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.160
 and I'm in a hurry this month number 800 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.230
 you'll see every favorite actor in front 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.060
 what author would be and what would you ask 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.830
 I think it's something known to everyone that 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.300
 has another favorite writer but not 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.010
 I could have a conversation with her 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.690
 for obvious reasons because it is no longer 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.490
 between us so I 'm going to create the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.350
 scenario in which I return to the past 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.750
 and he invited me, you came to have tea 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.610
 his beautiful house in bar has taken me out 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.750
 super rich pasta and a cup of tea 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.700
 very very pretty 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.860
 and if I have to ask a question it would be 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.990
 the next jane what do you think if 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.850
 you write a new novel putting together 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.400
 best of each of all the stories 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.320
 that you have created and you put leidy patrick 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.730
 of protagonist would be great truth 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.500
 you may think that this is a great 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.520
 foolishness that does not make sense but the 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.470
 truth is that I would do me a lot 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.880
 illusion that they reach you write a 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.050
 new novel of which I was his 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.640
 protagonist 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.170
 I no longer say principal that I would also 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.210
 much illusion but only will appear 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.280
 his novel the companion the protagonist 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.170
 principal or someone's sister 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.130
 important I do not know for sure it's the 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.930
 main mean much decision 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.700
 obviously but I would settle for a 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.080
 small paper in one of his novels and 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.120
 well now let's move on to two 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.190
 personal questions which are 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.440
 nine what is the most beautiful memory of 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.970
 that tends when I was a rationed girl 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.130
 with the world of writing and 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.630
 books I have a very happy memory and it is 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.700
 that at age 11 I won a prize of 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.710
 juvenile children's literature by writing 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.510
 I was very excited about a story 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.370
 because they gave it to me in front of all my 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.570
 family in front of a great paraninfo the 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.060
 uniqueness paraninfo that is pretty 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.770
 important here and the truth is that 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.960
 there were a lot of people who were engaged 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.760

 tiny but at the same time as very 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.070
 big not because I had won a prize
