yeah if you manage once also need John
Stefan's<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> was<00:03:26.520> over<00:03:26.820> something<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.360> think<00:03:27.660> I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
Stefan's it was over something I think I

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.660 
Stefan's it was over something I think I
think<00:03:28.140> we're<00:03:28.260> fortunate<00:03:28.500> some<00:03:28.980> regards<00:03:29.430> that

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
think we're fortunate some regards that

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.090 
think we're fortunate some regards that
if<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.330> was<00:03:30.480> specially<00:03:31.410> makes<00:03:31.590> been<00:03:31.800> in<00:03:31.950> some

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
if it was specially makes been in some

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.280 
if it was specially makes been in some
way<00:03:32.310> but<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.300> leads<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.930> trigger<00:03:34.110> two

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
way but it leads to the trigger two

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
way but it leads to the trigger two
dozen<00:03:34.560> sample<00:03:35.130> should<00:03:35.400> be<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.670> lot<00:03:36.360> about

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
dozen sample should be a lot about

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.000 
dozen sample should be a lot about
performance<00:03:36.840> related

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
performance related

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.910 
performance related
salaries<00:03:38.970> Emily<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.650> that's<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
salaries Emily and I think that's the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360 
salaries Emily and I think that's the
way<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.100> go<00:03:41.400> because<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.690> actually

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
way to go because if you can actually

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.830 
way to go because if you can actually
sound<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.519> Liverpool<00:03:44.880> knowing<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.600> do

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
sound a Liverpool knowing that if you do

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.300 
sound a Liverpool knowing that if you do
well<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.739> more

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
well you get more

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.650 
well you get more
yeah<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.670> neither<00:03:47.880> that's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.269> really<00:03:48.540> good

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
yeah the neither that's a really good

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.780 
yeah the neither that's a really good
position<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.200> silly<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.620> yolks<00:03:49.920> yeah

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
position for a silly for yolks yeah

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.100 
position for a silly for yolks yeah
that's<00:03:50.970> not<00:03:51.060> going<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.269> go<00:03:51.390> that's<00:03:51.630> what<00:03:51.810> we've

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
that's not going to go that's what we've
