okay<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:01.230> have<00:00:01.709> it<00:00:01.860> cranked<00:00:02.550> no<00:00:02.850> start<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.810> is

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay I have it cranked no start this is

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.710 
okay I have it cranked no start this is
another<00:00:04.290> one<00:00:04.560> now<00:00:05.339> remember<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:06.000> watched<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
another one now remember we watched the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.080 
another one now remember we watched the
victim<00:00:07.080> power<00:00:07.319> during<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.950> injection

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
victim power during the injection

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.039 
victim power during the injection
clatter<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.750> verify<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> ICP<00:00:11.429> is

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
clatter we verify that the ICP is

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.480 
clatter we verify that the ICP is
reading<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.380> want<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.980> see<00:00:14.099> under<00:00:14.280> atmospheric

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
reading we want to see under atmospheric

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.460 
reading we want to see under atmospheric
pressure<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.900> anywhere<00:00:16.230> from<00:00:16.470> 0<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.130> 15<00:00:17.940> s<00:00:18.060> okay

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
pressure so anywhere from 0 to 15 s okay

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.840 
pressure so anywhere from 0 to 15 s okay
now<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.770> thing<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.980> need<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> mention<00:00:20.400> if<00:00:20.789> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
now one thing I need to mention if you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.070 
now one thing I need to mention if you
have<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.750> new<00:00:22.410> style<00:00:22.740> ICP<00:00:23.519> sensor<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.240> an<00:00:24.510> O<00:00:24.630> 3

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
have the new style ICP sensor in an O 3

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.880 
have the new style ICP sensor in an O 3
or<00:00:25.320> no.4<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.400> may<00:00:26.550> read<00:00:26.760> 50<00:00:27.210> 60<00:00:27.630> psi<00:00:28.140> that's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
or no.4 they may read 50 60 psi that's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
or no.4 they may read 50 60 psi that's
normal<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:29.789> they're<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> little

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
normal just because they're off a little

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.049 
normal just because they're off a little
bit<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> cycle<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> key

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
bit so now I'm going to cycle the key

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.740 
bit so now I'm going to cycle the key
they<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.140> monitor<00:00:35.070> victim<00:00:35.670> empower<00:00:36.120> during

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they will monitor victim empower during

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
they will monitor victim empower during
the<00:00:37.110> Keith<00:00:37.469> injector<00:00:38.100> clatter<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:39.180> I'm

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the Keith injector clatter then I'm

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
the Keith injector clatter then I'm
going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> crank<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.170> watch<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:40.829> what

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
going to crank it and watch and see what

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.590 
going to crank it and watch and see what
we're<00:00:41.610> missing<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.239> sink<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.739> IPR<00:00:44.600> does

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we're missing is it sink is it IPR does

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
we're missing is it sink is it IPR does
it<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> get<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> 85%<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.890> victim<00:00:47.280> power

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
it have to get to 85% the victim power

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
it have to get to 85% the victim power
dropping<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.780> ICP<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.559> building<00:00:51.199> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
dropping or the ICP not building so

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.479 
dropping or the ICP not building so
there's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> key<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> injectors<00:00:56.010> clatter

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
there's a key on the injectors clatter

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
there's a key on the injectors clatter
it's<00:00:56.820> good<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> 48<00:00:58.079> volts<00:00:58.440> at

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it's good we've got the 48 volts at

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's good we've got the 48 volts at
least<00:00:58.829> during<00:00:59.039> clatter<00:00:59.399> remember<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.000> doesn't

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
least during clatter remember it doesn't

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.319 
least during clatter remember it doesn't
start<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.809> can't<00:01:01.050> check<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:02.329> I'm

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
start so we can't check it there I'm

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
start so we can't check it there I'm
going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> crank<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.110> glow<00:01:04.379> plug<00:01:04.619> lights

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
going to crank it now glow plug lights

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.910 
going to crank it now glow plug lights
out<00:01:05.150> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> crank<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> watch<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.290> ICP

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
out going to crank it and watch my ICP

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.460 
out going to crank it and watch my ICP
IPR<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.520> victim<00:01:08.909> power<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.080> sink<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
IPR and victim power and the sink of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:35.300 
IPR and victim power and the sink of
course

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.970 

okay<00:01:36.310> we<00:01:36.460> had<00:01:36.610> sink<00:01:37.060> we<00:01:37.240> had<00:01:37.360> pick'em<00:01:37.720> power

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
okay we had sink we had pick'em power

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.880 
okay we had sink we had pick'em power
with<00:01:38.980> a<00:01:39.010> maximum<00:01:39.550> ICP<00:01:40.510> I<00:01:40.900> saw<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.320> build<00:01:41.620> there

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
with a maximum ICP I saw a build there

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
with a maximum ICP I saw a build there
was<00:01:42.250> under<00:01:42.490> 400<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:44.620> a<00:01:44.650> we<00:01:45.580> can't<00:01:45.820> get

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
was under 400 so we have a we can't get

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.350 
was under 400 so we have a we can't get
that<00:01:46.060> we<00:01:46.300> again<00:01:46.780> we<00:01:46.900> need<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.260> 500<00:01:47.950> psi<00:01:48.430> just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
that we again we need the 500 psi just

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.090 
that we again we need the 500 psi just
to<00:01:49.600> start<00:01:49.990> taking<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.440> high<00:01:50.530> pressure<00:01:50.770> pump

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
to start taking the high pressure pump

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.830 
to start taking the high pressure pump
cover<00:01:51.280> off<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.670> we<00:01:52.180> found<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.690> ball

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
cover off and we found that the ball

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.370 
cover off and we found that the ball
bearing<00:01:53.230> has<00:01:53.860> come<00:01:54.220> out<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.490> side<00:01:55.380> there's

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
bearing has come out of the side there's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.690 
bearing has come out of the side there's
supposed<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.770> be<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.890> ball<00:01:57.070> bearing<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.520> there

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
supposed to be a ball bearing in there

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.430 
supposed to be a ball bearing in there
I'll<00:01:58.060> show<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.300> one<00:01:58.479> that's<00:02:01.140> here's<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.200> good

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
I'll show you one that's here's a good

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.210 
I'll show you one that's here's a good
one<00:02:02.650> compare<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.950> here's<00:02:06.160> the

one compare it to and then here's the
one<00:02:06.280> that's<00:02:06.580> had<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> truck<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:08.200> all<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
one that's had the truck so all the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.020 
one that's had the truck so all the
pressure<00:02:08.740> was<00:02:08.860> bleeding<00:02:09.369> off<00:02:09.520> here<00:02:09.820> had<00:02:10.000> to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
pressure was bleeding off here had to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.060 
pressure was bleeding off here had to
decide<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.600> dumping<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.530> truck<00:02:11.770> became

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
decide and dumping and the truck became

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.699 
decide and dumping and the truck became
a<00:02:12.100> nose<00:02:12.370> start<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:13.360> where<00:02:13.540> they<00:02:14.200> wouldn't<00:02:14.650> go

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
a nose start to where they wouldn't go

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.010 
a nose start to where they wouldn't go
to<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.950> treasure<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.030> anyhow<00:02:16.450> kind<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.810> pump

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
to the treasure so anyhow kind of pump

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.780 
to the treasure so anyhow kind of pump

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
we've used a quarter inch pipe thread

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.310 
we've used a quarter inch pipe thread
went<00:02:27.670> inside<00:02:27.910> there<00:02:28.090> tapped<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.690> plugged<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
went inside there tapped it plugged it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.790 
went inside there tapped it plugged it
and<00:02:29.530> it's<00:02:30.010> worked<00:02:30.400> I've<00:02:31.150> done<00:02:31.480> -<00:02:31.780> one<00:02:32.230> word<00:02:32.410> one

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
and it's worked I've done - one word one

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.040 
and it's worked I've done - one word one
did<00:02:33.130> not<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.850> still<00:02:33.970> started<00:02:34.570> but<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.840> with<00:02:35.020> a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
did not it's still started but it with a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.009 
did not it's still started but it with a
pump<00:02:35.290> would<00:02:35.470> go<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.860> IPR<00:02:36.820> we<00:02:36.910> go<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.090> 85%<00:02:37.900> so

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019

it's a long snap on eight millimeter
wrench<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:43.349> use<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.980> get<00:03:44.129> underneath<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
wrench we use this to get underneath the

wrench we use this to get underneath the
EGR<00:03:45.930> cooler<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.530> break<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.829> bolts<00:03:47.129> loose

down this side this is one way the other
way<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.889> using<00:03:56.099> a<00:03:56.280> ratcheting<00:03:56.760> wrench<00:03:57.000> it

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
way is using a ratcheting wrench it

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.270 
way is using a ratcheting wrench it
would<00:03:57.719> reach<00:03:57.900> anything<00:03:58.169> over<00:03:58.500> cool<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.950> EGR

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
would reach anything over cool the EGR

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.170 
would reach anything over cool the EGR
cooler<00:04:00.079> here<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.439> get<00:04:01.650> them<00:04:01.769> out<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.250> things

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
cooler here and get them out to things
