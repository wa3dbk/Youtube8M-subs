homemade<00:00:12.300> wind<00:00:12.570> turbine<00:00:13.049> bike<00:00:13.500> wheel

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:40.240 

constantly<00:00:17.850> spins<00:00:18.150> never<00:00:18.510> stops<00:00:21.500> yeah

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610 

this<00:00:40.970> is<00:00:41.120> just<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.420> prototype<00:00:41.690> eventually<00:00:42.530> I

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
this is just a prototype eventually I

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.410 
this is just a prototype eventually I
will<00:00:42.830> attach<00:00:43.160> a<00:00:43.280> generator<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.850> want<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.270> make

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
will attach a generator to want to make

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.940 
will attach a generator to want to make
a<00:00:44.450> bigger<00:00:44.780> one<00:00:44.900> like<00:00:45.580> so<00:00:46.580> far<00:00:47.260> this<00:00:48.260> thing<00:00:48.620> puts

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
a bigger one like so far this thing puts

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.780 
a bigger one like so far this thing puts
out<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.430> lot<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.910> rpms<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.950> winds<00:00:52.280> only<00:00:52.430> like

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
out a lot of rpms the winds only like

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.230 
out a lot of rpms the winds only like
maybe<00:00:53.300> 5<00:00:53.660> miles<00:00:53.960> an<00:00:54.170> hour<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:55.000> got<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.030> lot<00:00:56.210> of

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
maybe 5 miles an hour and got a lot of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:40.020 
maybe 5 miles an hour and got a lot of
rotation<00:01:01.090> yeah

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.060

Yaga couple lambs I don't know you can
see<00:01:55.910> it's<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:57.280> got<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> lot<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.610> speed<00:01:58.880> here

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
see it's really got a lot of speed here

see it's really got a lot of speed here
I<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:06.170> put<00:02:06.470> two<00:02:07.210> pipes<00:02:08.210> in<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.570> ground<00:02:08.600> here

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
I just put two pipes in the ground here

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.660 
I just put two pipes in the ground here
metallic<00:02:10.550> ones<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:12.100> that's<00:02:13.100> really<00:02:13.400> all

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
metallic ones and that's really all

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.310 
metallic ones and that's really all
there<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.570> bike<00:02:14.780> wheel<00:02:15.050> with

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
there is to it in the bike wheel with

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.840 
there is to it in the bike wheel with
tape<00:02:16.040> boning<00:02:16.430> that's<00:02:16.670> really<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:18.370> all<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
tape boning that's really it I all the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.370 
tape boning that's really it I all the
bearings<00:02:20.330> took<00:02:20.750> them<00:02:20.900> out<00:02:22.900> that's<00:02:23.900> really<00:02:24.080> all

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
bearings took them out that's really all

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.950 
bearings took them out that's really all
there<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:25.100> not<00:02:25.250> anything<00:02:25.730> too<00:02:26.480> hard<00:02:26.690> to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
me so again I will attach a generator to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.170 
me so again I will attach a generator to
a<00:02:33.940> thank<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.060> for<00:02:35.300> watching<00:02:36.850> rate<00:02:37.850> comment
