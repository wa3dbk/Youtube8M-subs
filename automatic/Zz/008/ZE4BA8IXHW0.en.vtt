four<00:01:28.020> goals<00:01:28.049> at<00:01:28.439> home<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.400> can't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
four goals at home but we know we can't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
four goals at home but we know we can't
defend<00:01:30.140> as<00:01:31.140> poor<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.799> did<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:33.450> thought

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
defend as poor as we did and I thought

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.960 
defend as poor as we did and I thought
one<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> goals<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.220> great<00:01:35.520> girl<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
one of the goals was a great girl I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
one of the goals was a great girl I
thought<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> other<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> defendable<00:01:37.259> if

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
thought the other two and defendable if

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
thought the other two and defendable if

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
comfortable with without defending today

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.190 
comfortable with without defending today
that's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.540> us<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.899> to

defensively for the season so far cause

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.370 
defensively for the season so far cause
I've<00:03:12.859> been<00:03:12.950> fantastic<00:03:13.519> three<00:03:14.480> all<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.660> time

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
I've been fantastic three all the time

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.410 
I've been fantastic three all the time
TT<00:03:15.620> was<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.459> was<00:03:16.579> going<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.820> be<00:03:16.880> casing<00:03:17.299> is

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
TT was it was going to be casing is

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.729 
TT was it was going to be casing is
going<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.600> be<00:03:17.660> much<00:03:17.780> tighter<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> sec<00:03:18.440> yeah<00:03:18.470> I

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
going to be much tighter in a sec yeah I

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.860 
going to be much tighter in a sec yeah I
think<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.160> they<00:03:20.000> change<00:03:20.269> their<00:03:20.450> system<00:03:20.780> with

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
think so they change their system with

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.300 
think so they change their system with
the<00:03:20.959> free<00:03:21.140> center<00:03:21.410> house<00:03:22.780> probably<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:25.040> plan

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the free center house probably to plan

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.920 
the free center house probably to plan
on<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.489> counter-attack<00:03:25.850> probably<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.870> little

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
on the counter-attack probably a little

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.880 
on the counter-attack probably a little
bit<00:03:27.109> more<00:03:27.290> than<00:03:27.500> they<00:03:27.650> work<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.829> know

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
bit more than they work and you know

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.800 
bit more than they work and you know
that<00:03:31.310> were<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.579> problem<00:03:31.609> with<00:03:32.209> games<00:03:32.450> settled

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
that were the problem with games settled

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.170
