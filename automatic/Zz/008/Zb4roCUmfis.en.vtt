 Look at you once more on tastes the week. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.740

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 interesting are the organic 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 That's even organic and to talk about this. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.060
 I'm going to use a recipe that's a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.010
 Delicious everybody likes this barbecue. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.460
 even a fully organic barbecue 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.460
 come on 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 the success of a great barbecue does not 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.350
 is only in the choice of a good meat but 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 in the choice of their accompaniments and I 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.820
 here I made a food basket 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.719
 organic as this is our theme 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.969
 zucchini tomato pepper corn I will 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.350
 start with our vinaigrette and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.410
 time we cut and already feel the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.660
 aroma very different from ordinary tomato 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 a sauce who is making the sauce 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.399
 campaign that is the tomato sauce 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.340
 onion and an herb that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.510
 yellow pepper parsley to give 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 quite color right 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 say that the more colorful the food 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:13.500
 healthier it becomes clear that in the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.229
 vinaigrette sebum can not miss it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.229
 chopped everything apart and now I go 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.420
 season our millet 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.090
 vinaigrette is the mixture of an oil with a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 acid is that we use the oil and the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.829
 vinegar 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.810
 after the vinegar and parsley to give a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.260
 very interesting color in our 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.010
 own sun just mixing 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.220
 Italian zucchini ready vinaigrette 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.520
 organic 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.409
 look wonderful heart and the code goes 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.250
 be a little thicker because how's it going? 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.320
 to the grill 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:59.030
 we need a time not to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:03.649
 burn greet the corn I already 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.020
 I have pre-cooked cut in two parts 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.000
 all the accompaniments already prepared 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.610
 now the meat 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 we are in organic meat the meat 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.750
 to be organic already has a whole preparation 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.760
 different in animal breeding 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.370
 in fact this animal he is raised in 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.459
 loose pasture these cattle do not receive feed 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.220
 and here I chose two cuts the picanha 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.340
 and the skirt but there are numerous cuts 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.320
 in the rump steak market is you 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.360
 chooses its preferred 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.170
 the picanha you can make several 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.019
 shapes 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.720
 If you are going to cut the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.989
 two fingers if you're going to make a skewer 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.190
 three to four fingers and always remembers 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.190
 cut against fiber 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.080
 careful to stick because it is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.080
 working with a pointed object, right? 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:07.849
 the skirt I'm not going to cut and I'll use a 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:10.549
 double skewer besides the bovine me 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.950
 I have the chicken and a minority of soy and the 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.629
 chicken seasoning with salt pepper 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.129
 and an organic olive oil 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.010
 if you want to leave it tempered 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:23.420
 is much better because the seasoning 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.519
 penetrates the house very well and a 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.730
 soy hamburger is also legal for 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.670
 Who has vegetarian party friends? 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.670
 ready took a sliced ​​vinaigrette ready 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.450
 meat just waiting for the sun and now it comes out 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.450
 for barbecue 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.220
 So the staff liked it. 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.440
 I quite liked organic food 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.370
 besides being healthier is much more 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.600
 tasty on a barbecue so do not even talk 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.600
 Good value, play there.
