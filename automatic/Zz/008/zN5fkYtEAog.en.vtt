case we are making a hip-hop style beat
and<00:01:04.470> you'll<00:01:05.369> notice<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.860> I'm<00:01:07.860> adding<00:01:08.250> in

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and you'll notice that I'm adding in

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.929 
and you'll notice that I'm adding in
more<00:01:09.060> things<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.680> holding<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.549> shift

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
more things and then holding the shift

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.510 
more things and then holding the shift
key<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.040> moving<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> mouse<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:14.939> down<00:01:16.520> this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
key and moving the mouse up or down this

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.420 
key and moving the mouse up or down this
is<00:01:17.759> called<00:01:18.439> probabilistic<00:01:19.909> dum<00:01:20.909> programming

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
is called probabilistic dum programming

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
is called probabilistic dum programming
what<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> means<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> drum<00:01:27.479> may<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.110> may<00:01:28.380> not

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
what it means is the drum may or may not

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.630 
what it means is the drum may or may not
sound<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.229> that<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.070> make<00:01:32.280> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
sound and that way you can make more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.200 
sound and that way you can make more
complicated<00:01:33.090> grooves<00:01:33.750> Here<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> am<00:01:35.210> playing

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
complicated grooves Here I am playing

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
complicated grooves Here I am playing
with<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> waveform<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.939> kick<00:01:39.240> itself<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
with the waveform of the kick itself to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.030 
with the waveform of the kick itself to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
create a scratch type effect and all of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.060 
create a scratch type effect and all of
these<00:01:44.220> parameters<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.939> automatable<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.200> we

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
these parameters are automatable and we

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.359 
these parameters are automatable and we
can<00:01:47.310> record<00:01:47.700> them<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.149> real<00:01:48.509> time

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.349 

here<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:53.000> go<00:01:53.179> into<00:01:53.450> sort<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.259> jib<00:01:54.710> tune<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
here we go into sort of a jib tune the

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.209 
here we go into sort of a jib tune the
sound<00:01:56.359> I'm<00:01:57.079> going<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.500> show<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:58.329> you<00:01:59.329> can<00:01:59.570> put

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
sound I'm going to show you you can put

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.649 
sound I'm going to show you you can put
automation<00:02:01.219> on<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.640> Blitz<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.240> now<00:02:02.509> I'm

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
automation on the Blitz there now I'm

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.730 
automation on the Blitz there now I'm
changing<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.350> pitch<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.039> blips<00:02:05.740> going

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
changing the pitch of the blips going

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.999 
changing the pitch of the blips going
into<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:08.030> specific<00:02:08.629> screen<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.500> one

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
into the specific screen for that one

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.289 
into the specific screen for that one
sound<00:02:10.459> I'm<00:02:11.299> adding<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.959> more<00:02:12.680> blips<00:02:14.769> changing

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
sound I'm adding in more blips changing

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.640 
sound I'm adding in more blips changing
the<00:02:17.299> different<00:02:19.239> pitches<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.750> volumes<00:02:21.290> for

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
the different pitches and volumes for

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.900 
the different pitches and volumes for
those<00:02:23.440> then<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> minute<00:02:25.069> I'll<00:02:25.280> go<00:02:25.519> back<00:02:25.700> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
those then in a minute I'll go back to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.199 
those then in a minute I'll go back to
the<00:02:26.060> main<00:02:26.380> performance<00:02:27.380> screen<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.680> are

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
the main performance screen there we are

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.229 
the main performance screen there we are
and<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:33.260> top<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.799> that<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.610> also<00:02:34.819> adjust

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
and now on top of that I can also adjust

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.850 
and now on top of that I can also adjust
the<00:02:35.660> pitch<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:37.640> real<00:02:37.940> time<00:02:38.299> on<00:02:39.110> top<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.590> the
