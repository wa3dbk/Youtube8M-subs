wireless<00:01:10.399> keyboard<00:01:11.020> uses<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.049> USB<00:01:12.979> dongle

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
wireless keyboard uses a USB dongle

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.550 
wireless keyboard uses a USB dongle
that's<00:01:14.000> like<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.450> smallest<00:01:14.840> dongle<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.409> can

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
that's like the smallest dongle you can

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.499 
that's like the smallest dongle you can
get<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.610> can<00:01:16.759> put<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.000> inside<00:01:17.090> your<00:01:17.390> in

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509

the netbooks USB or a desktop cos

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.560 
the netbooks USB or a desktop cos
becomes<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.890> little<00:01:22.130> adapter<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.119> it'll<00:01:23.360> stick

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
becomes a little adapter so it'll stick

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.440 
becomes a little adapter so it'll stick
out<00:01:23.720> about<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.100> know<00:01:25.220> two<00:01:25.610> inches<00:01:25.909> or<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.210> I

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
out about you know two inches or so I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.270 
out about you know two inches or so I
guess<00:01:26.960> that's<00:01:27.320> for<00:01:27.560> added<00:01:27.770> range<00:01:28.009> because

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
guess that's for added range because

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.219 
guess that's for added range because
obviously<00:01:28.430> if<00:01:28.850> you're<00:01:28.939> using<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.509> laptop<00:01:29.869> you

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
obviously if you're using a laptop you

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.680 
obviously if you're using a laptop you
can<00:01:30.320> go<00:01:30.439> further<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:30.860> further<00:01:31.509> further<00:01:32.509> away

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
can go further and further further away

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.960 
can go further and further further away
or<00:01:32.929> closer<00:01:33.280> unlike<00:01:34.280> with<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.429> desktop<00:01:34.819> word

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
or closer unlike with a desktop word

stationary<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:35.840> can<00:01:36.080> see<00:01:36.229> why<00:01:36.350> they<00:01:36.470> would

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
stationary so I can see why they would

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.559 
stationary so I can see why they would
do<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:36.830> but<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.490> plugged<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.450> to

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
do that but I I plugged it in just to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.710 
do that but I I plugged it in just to
have<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.780> plugged<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.560> don't<00:01:39.740> lose<00:01:39.860> it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
have it plugged in so I don't lose it

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.719 
have it plugged in so I don't lose it
the<00:01:41.720> keyboard<00:01:42.110> itself<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.590> very<00:01:42.890> thin<00:01:43.429> you<00:01:43.700> can

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
the keyboard itself is very thin you can

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.359 
the keyboard itself is very thin you can
see<00:01:44.030> right<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:44.649> come<00:01:45.649> on<00:01:45.770> camera<00:01:46.069> there<00:01:46.310> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
see right now come on camera there you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.639 
see right now come on camera there you
go<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:47.149> could<00:01:47.720> read<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.049> specification

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
go I could read you the specification

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.980 
go I could read you the specification
but<00:01:48.770> who<00:01:48.860> cares<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:50.270> really<00:01:50.479> just<00:01:50.509> want<00:01:50.659> how
