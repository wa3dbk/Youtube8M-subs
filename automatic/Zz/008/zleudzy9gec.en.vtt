00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
boss pedals that I just wouldn't buy or

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.920 
boss pedals that I just wouldn't buy or
use<00:00:15.650> similar<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.190> TR<00:00:17.460> -<00:00:17.640> tremolo<00:00:18.210> it's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
use similar to the the TR - tremolo it's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.620 
use similar to the the TR - tremolo it's
just<00:00:19.170> got<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:20.340> pretty<00:00:20.490> serious<00:00:20.760> issues<00:00:21.150> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
just got some pretty serious issues that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.560 
just got some pretty serious issues that
to<00:00:21.750> me<00:00:21.869> render<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> unusable<00:00:23.240> first<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.449> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to me render it unusable first of all it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.320 
to me render it unusable first of all it
really<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.080> distorts<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> signal<00:00:26.330> really

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
really just distorts the signal really

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.529 
really just distorts the signal really
just<00:00:27.510> adds<00:00:28.609> frequencies<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.849> distortion<00:00:30.359> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
just adds frequencies and distortion and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.620 
just adds frequencies and distortion and
noise<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.990> isn't<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.239> then<00:00:33.239> probably

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
noise that isn't there and then probably

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010 
noise that isn't there and then probably
the<00:00:33.809> worst<00:00:34.020> issue<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.760> noise<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the worst issue is is just the noise and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.860 
the worst issue is is just the noise and
signal<00:00:37.460> whether<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.670> you're<00:00:39.180> cutting

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
signal whether you're you're cutting

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.569 
signal whether you're you're cutting
frequencies<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.010> makes<00:00:41.160> no<00:00:41.219> sense

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
frequencies which really makes no sense

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.750 
frequencies which really makes no sense
or<00:00:41.820> adding<00:00:42.600> frequencies<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> EQ<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
or adding frequencies with the EQ and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.619 
or adding frequencies with the EQ and
the<00:00:44.850> stock<00:00:45.059> form

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the stock form

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.310 
the stock form
it's<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.500> noisy<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.629> noisy

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's just noisy it's just really noisy

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
it's just noisy it's just really noisy
unusually<00:00:49.920> noisy<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.260> no

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
unusually noisy so there really was no

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
unusually noisy so there really was no
point<00:00:52.649> even<00:00:52.980> comparing<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.390> alchemy

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
point even comparing it with alchemy

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
point even comparing it with alchemy
audio<00:00:55.410> modified<00:00:56.399> version<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.180> kind<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
audio modified version so I just kind of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
audio modified version so I just kind of
wanted<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.629> jump<00:00:57.840> straight<00:00:58.140> into<00:00:58.460> just<00:00:59.460> how

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
wanted to jump straight into just how

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.700 
wanted to jump straight into just how
good<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.820> pedal<00:01:00.090> sounds<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.649> kind<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
good this pedal sounds so kind of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
good this pedal sounds so kind of
highlight<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> couple<00:01:02.579> uses<00:01:03.080> where<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
highlight it and a couple uses where you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
highlight it and a couple uses where you
might<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.530> using<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:04.890> EQ<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.610> would<00:01:05.820> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
might be using an EQ the first would be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.859 
might be using an EQ the first would be
just<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> clean<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.720> your<00:01:07.710> amps<00:01:08.010> natural<00:01:08.400> sound

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
just to clean up your amps natural sound

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.210 
just to clean up your amps natural sound
so<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.049> gonna<00:01:10.170> play<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.670> standard<00:01:12.299> ecord

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
so I'm gonna play just a standard ecord

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.880 
so I'm gonna play just a standard ecord
into<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.310> marshall<00:01:14.700> class<00:01:14.909> 5<00:01:15.590> without<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
into this marshall class 5 without the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
into this marshall class 5 without the
EQ<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.549> kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
EQ on I'm just kind of here so you can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:32.620 
EQ on I'm just kind of here so you can
hear<00:01:18.750> where<00:01:18.869> things<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.200> at

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.360 

class<00:01:33.630> 5<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:34.080> known<00:01:34.260> for<00:01:34.530> having<00:01:34.620> some<00:01:34.830> some

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
class 5 is known for having some some

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.330 
class 5 is known for having some some
lower<00:01:35.700> end<00:01:35.820> problems<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:36.750> definitely

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
lower end problems and I definitely

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.380 
lower end problems and I definitely
notice<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.700> experience<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.300> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
notice that in my experience with the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.360 
notice that in my experience with the
amp<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.870> time<00:01:40.020> I've<00:01:40.200> owned<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.830> kind

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
amp and the time I've owned it so kind

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.820 
amp and the time I've owned it so kind
what<00:01:41.520> I've<00:01:41.640> done<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.270> EQ<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.020> I've

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
what I've done with the EQ here is I've

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.500 
what I've done with the EQ here is I've
knocked<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.520> travel<00:01:44.850> frequencies<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
knocked up the travel frequencies just a

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.110 
knocked up the travel frequencies just a
little<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.900> cut<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.980> mids<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.700> ever<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
little bit cut the mids just ever so

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.290 
little bit cut the mids just ever so
slightly<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.690> then<00:01:49.260> also<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.910> cut<00:01:51.150> the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
slightly and then also have have cut the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200 
slightly and then also have have cut the
low<00:01:51.450> frequencies<00:01:52.190> just<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.370> hair<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.970> kind

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
low frequencies just a hair just to kind

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.350 
low frequencies just a hair just to kind
of<00:01:54.270> balance<00:01:54.390> things<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:57.180> new

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of balance things out and so the new

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:10.080 
of balance things out and so the new
sound<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.170> EQ<00:01:58.350> engaged

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.910 

so<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.210> focused<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:12.260> lows<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.500> tighter

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
so it's focused the lows are tighter

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040 
so it's focused the lows are tighter
I'll<00:02:13.640> just<00:02:13.760> play<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:13.940> one<00:02:14.150> more<00:02:14.300> time<00:02:14.540> side<00:02:14.900> by

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I'll just play it one more time side by

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:28.120 
I'll just play it one more time side by
side<00:02:24.730> just<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> much<00:02:26.030> cleaner<00:02:26.810> sound<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.890> just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
side just a much cleaner sound it's just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.900 
side just a much cleaner sound it's just
focused<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.600> much<00:02:29.870> more<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:31.130> hi-fi<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.820> I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
focused and much more just hi-fi and I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.600 
focused and much more just hi-fi and I
really<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:33.020> effective<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.500> brings<00:02:33.800> so

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
really like the effective that brings so

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.760 
really like the effective that brings so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
now I want to give a couple examples of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.250 
now I want to give a couple examples of
using<00:02:36.950> an<00:02:37.130> EQ<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.640> more<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.090> an<00:02:38.600> effect<00:02:38.960> type

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
using an EQ is more of an effect type

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.670 
using an EQ is more of an effect type
pedal<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.760> one<00:02:41.690> thing<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.320> for<00:02:42.410> sure<00:02:42.530> is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
pedal so one thing that's for sure is

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.290 
pedal so one thing that's for sure is
kind<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.430> using<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.210> u-shape<00:02:44.770> EQ<00:02:45.770> curve

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
kind of using like the u-shape EQ curve

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.690 
kind of using like the u-shape EQ curve
and<00:02:47.300> an<00:02:47.420> extreme<00:02:47.750> setting<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.920> something<00:02:49.220> that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
and an extreme setting is something that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.050 
and an extreme setting is something that
guys<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.810> play<00:02:51.050> heavier<00:02:51.890> type<00:02:52.220> styles<00:02:52.940> of

you know heavy rock they're kind of
known<00:02:59.360> for<00:02:59.390> using<00:02:59.810> this<00:03:00.170> EQ<00:03:00.650> shape<00:03:01.280> sometimes

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
known for using this EQ shape sometimes

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.000 
known for using this EQ shape sometimes
so<00:03:02.480> you've<00:03:02.630> got<00:03:02.810> your<00:03:02.930> lows<00:03:03.230> boosted<00:03:03.920> your

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
so you've got your lows boosted your

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.280 
so you've got your lows boosted your
mids<00:03:04.310> basically<00:03:04.940> cut<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.390> then<00:03:05.960> your<00:03:06.080> high<00:03:06.230> is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
mids basically cut and then your high is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.080 
mids basically cut and then your high is
boosted<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:06.950> well<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.550> get<00:03:07.700> kind<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.970> this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
boosted as well and you get kind of this

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.010 
boosted as well and you get kind of this
u-shape<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:10.130> what<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.370> want<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.550> do<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:11.060> have

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
u-shape so what I want to do is have

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.520 
u-shape so what I want to do is have
made<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.590> shape<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:14.480> now<00:03:14.840> I'm<00:03:15.170> also<00:03:15.380> going

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
made that shape and now I'm also going

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.580 
made that shape and now I'm also going
to<00:03:15.950> use<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:17.170> boost<00:03:18.170> slider<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.520> g7<00:03:20.030> and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
to use the boost slider of the g7 and

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.780 
to use the boost slider of the g7 and
just<00:03:21.590> kind<00:03:21.800> of<00:03:21.860> add<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.010> more<00:03:22.370> behind<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.730> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
just kind of add some more behind in the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.830 
just kind of add some more behind in the
mix<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.239> what<00:03:23.390> kind<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.540> see<00:03:23.660> what<00:03:23.750> this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
mix and so what kind of see what this

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.540 
mix and so what kind of see what this
does<00:03:23.989> here<00:03:24.140> so

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.030 

all<00:03:31.300> right<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.750> we've<00:03:32.320> got<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.740> kind<00:03:32.920> of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
all right so we've got this kind of

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.589 
all right so we've got this kind of
sound<00:03:33.280> without<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:35.050> effect<00:03:35.620> engaged

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.030 

all<00:03:40.290> right<00:03:40.469> and<00:03:40.709> now<00:03:40.829> with<00:03:41.280> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.570 

so<00:03:45.000> instantly<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.739> g7<00:03:47.159> we've<00:03:47.459> been

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
so instantly just with the g7 we've been

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.970 
so instantly just with the g7 we've been
able<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.790> completely<00:03:48.120> change<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:49.170> EQ<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.709> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
able to completely change the EQ of the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.789 
able to completely change the EQ of the
guitar<00:03:50.220> sound<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.819> then<00:03:51.209> also<00:03:51.420> add<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.110> add<00:03:52.560> in

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
guitar sound and then also add it add in

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.190 
guitar sound and then also add it add in

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
just you know volume with that that gain

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.380 
just you know volume with that that gain
slider<00:03:55.409> and<00:03:55.890> really<00:03:56.400> almost<00:03:56.760> use<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.239> as<00:03:57.360> a

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
slider and really almost use it as a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.780 
slider and really almost use it as a
distortion<00:03:57.900> type<00:03:58.260> pedal<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.769> that's<00:03:59.189> a<00:03:59.340> really

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790
