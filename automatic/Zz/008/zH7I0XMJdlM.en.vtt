could<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.360> had<00:00:15.929> my<00:00:16.080> suspicions<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.740> may<00:00:16.920> have

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
could be I had my suspicions I may have

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.700 
could be I had my suspicions I may have
run<00:00:17.160> into<00:00:17.369> my<00:00:17.490> first<00:00:17.730> case<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:19.470> brown

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
run into my first case of a the brown

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.010 
run into my first case of a the brown
jelly<00:00:20.039> disease<00:00:20.400> I've<00:00:20.640> heard<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.359> LPS

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
jelly disease I've heard about with LPS

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040 
jelly disease I've heard about with LPS
pools<00:00:23.150> hopefully<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.630> case<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
pools hopefully that's not the case and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.720 
pools hopefully that's not the case and
hopefully<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> case<00:00:26.130> I've

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
hopefully if it is the case I've

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
hopefully if it is the case I've
isolated<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.859> which<00:00:28.859> I'll<00:00:29.039> give<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.279> guys<00:00:29.460> an

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
isolated it which I'll give you guys an

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.609 
isolated it which I'll give you guys an
idea<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.000> what's<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:31.050> far<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.560> can

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
idea of what's going on as far as I can

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.130 
idea of what's going on as far as I can
tell<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.279> only<00:00:32.430> affected<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.360> pink<00:00:33.660> towards

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
tell it's only affected my pink towards

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
tell it's only affected my pink towards
corals<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> front<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.100> rock<00:00:35.340> work

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
corals in the front of this rock work

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.290 
corals in the front of this rock work
now<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> gap<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.010> between<00:00:38.149> cores<00:00:39.149> on

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
now you see a gap in between cores on

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
now you see a gap in between cores on
the<00:00:39.390> left<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the left and the right well the two that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
the left and the right well the two that
we're<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> middle<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:42.329> corals

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
we're in the middle of these corals

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
we're in the middle of these corals
pretty<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.710> disintegrated<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> way

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
pretty much disintegrated all the way

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
pretty much disintegrated all the way
down<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> skeleton<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> looked<00:00:47.100> like

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
down to the skeleton and it looked like

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060 
down to the skeleton and it looked like
they<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.610> melted<00:00:48.120> away<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> removed<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
they just melted away so I removed that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.590 
they just melted away so I removed that
skeleton<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> tank<00:00:51.059> thinking<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> was

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
skeleton from the tank thinking it was

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
skeleton from the tank thinking it was
just<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.960> fluke<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:53.070> wasn't<00:00:53.309> gonna

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
just a fluke you know wasn't gonna

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
just a fluke you know wasn't gonna
happen<00:00:53.699> again<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.510> I'll<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.930> damned

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
happen again and I'll be damned

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.490 
happen again and I'll be damned
next<00:00:56.250> day<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.600> another<00:00:58.050> head<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> my

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
next day I see it another head of my

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
next day I see it another head of my
cool<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:59.399> opening<00:00:59.789> out<00:00:59.969> showing<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> same

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
cool not opening out showing the same

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.880 
cool not opening out showing the same
symptoms<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.480> my<00:01:03.480> guess<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.530> has<00:01:04.589> something

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
symptoms so my guess is it has something

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
symptoms so my guess is it has something
to<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> brown<00:01:05.850> jelly<00:01:06.119> disease<00:01:06.479> but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to do with the brown jelly disease but

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
to do with the brown jelly disease but
I'm<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.530> sure<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.520> far<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.270> could<00:01:09.450> have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I'm not sure as far as what could have

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
I'm not sure as far as what could have
caused<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:11.040> sure<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.430> nothing

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
caused this I'm not sure if nothing

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
caused this I'm not sure if nothing
something<00:01:11.909> different<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.540> did<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> water<00:01:13.140> change

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
something different I did a water change

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
something different I did a water change
a<00:01:13.740> couple<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.220> days<00:01:14.369> before<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.939> my<00:01:15.180> same<00:01:15.450> six

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
a couple of days before this my same six

gallon deal you know acclimating my
water<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.509> sure<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> pH<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.259> good<00:01:19.500> salinity

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

was<00:01:20.400> matching<00:01:20.750> temperature<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.110> good

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
was matching temperature all that good

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.800 
was matching temperature all that good
stuff<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.850> sure<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> solution

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
stuff so I'm not sure what the solution
