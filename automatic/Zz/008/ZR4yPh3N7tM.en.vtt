00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.580 
trotting in the saddle without stirrups
is<00:00:13.010> actually<00:00:13.820> harder<00:00:14.210> than<00:00:14.240> riding<00:00:14.900> at<00:00:15.230> a<00:00:15.260> trot

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
is actually harder than riding at a trot

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.400 
is actually harder than riding at a trot
bareback<00:00:16.120> because<00:00:17.120> the<00:00:17.360> saddle<00:00:17.780> is<00:00:17.930> slippery

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
and the hardness of the saddle makes it

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.550 
and the hardness of the saddle makes it
hard<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.830> absorb<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.430> shock<00:00:22.460> of<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:23.030> trot

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560

really<00:01:08.090> important<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.840> eliminate<00:01:09.710> as<00:01:09.829> much

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
really important to eliminate as much

discomfort is distracting to the horse

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.679 
discomfort is distracting to the horse
and<00:01:15.140> makes<00:01:16.039> it<00:01:16.219> harder<00:01:16.549> for<00:01:16.579> him<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.000> listen<00:01:17.570> to

one<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.920> safest<00:01:22.159> ways<00:01:22.609> to<00:01:22.640> ride<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.359> I

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
one of the safest ways to ride and I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.630 
one of the safest ways to ride and I
really<00:01:24.350> recommend<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.950> for<00:01:25.219> teaching

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
really recommend it for teaching

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.859 
really recommend it for teaching
beginners<00:01:27.009> when<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.039> rider<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.640> bareback<00:01:29.149> it's

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
beginners when a rider is bareback it's

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.050 
beginners when a rider is bareback it's
much<00:01:30.170> easier<00:01:30.200> for<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:31.159> horse<00:01:31.399> to<00:01:31.490> know<00:01:31.820> how<00:01:32.000> to

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
much easier for the horse to know how to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.240 
much easier for the horse to know how to
take<00:01:32.329> care<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.899> writer<00:01:33.109> they're<00:01:34.009> better

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
take care of the writer they're better

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.580 
take care of the writer they're better
able<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.700> feel<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.210> riders<00:01:35.719> balance<00:01:36.320> and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
able to feel the riders balance and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.459 
able to feel the riders balance and
better<00:01:37.369> able<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.820> tell<00:01:38.149> if<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:39.109> rider<00:01:39.289> is

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
better able to tell if the rider is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.649 
better able to tell if the rider is
clutching<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:40.520> they're<00:01:40.820> scared<00:01:41.240> or

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
clutching because they're scared or

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.039 
clutching because they're scared or
clenching<00:01:42.049> because<00:01:42.530> they<00:01:42.710> want<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.039> go<00:01:43.159> faster

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
clenching because they want to go faster

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.959 
clenching because they want to go faster
it's<00:01:45.049> also<00:01:45.289> easier<00:01:45.859> for<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.310> horse<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.609> learn

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's also easier for the horse to learn

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.840 
it's also easier for the horse to learn
to<00:01:47.479> trot<00:01:47.749> solely<00:01:48.170> because<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.310> easy<00:01:49.520> for

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
to trot solely because it's easy for

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.849 
to trot solely because it's easy for
them<00:01:49.999> to<00:01:50.060> see<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.479> when<00:01:50.869> they<00:01:51.020> trot<00:01:51.259> faster

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
them to see that when they trot faster
