we<00:01:10.320> fully<00:01:10.619> reconnect<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.490> these<00:01:11.640> things

we fully reconnect all of these things

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
we fully reconnect all of these things
then<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> river<00:01:12.479> will<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.659> functioning<00:01:13.320> as

live here on the Treasure Coast we have

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.130 
live here on the Treasure Coast we have
the<00:03:52.670> Indian<00:03:53.030> River<00:03:53.150> Lagoon<00:03:53.299> right<00:03:53.690> here<00:03:53.930> and

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
the Indian River Lagoon right here and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.710 
the Indian River Lagoon right here and
near<00:03:54.500> shore<00:03:54.739> reefs<00:03:55.100> so<00:03:56.060> our<00:03:56.180> philosophy<00:03:56.600> is

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
near shore reefs so our philosophy is

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.080 
near shore reefs so our philosophy is
that<00:03:56.750> everybody<00:03:57.650> should<00:03:57.830> know<00:03:58.040> some<00:03:58.880> very

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
that everybody should know some very

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.789 
that everybody should know some very
fundamental<00:03:59.360> things<00:03:59.810> about<00:04:00.140> our<00:04:00.350> marine

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
fundamental things about our marine

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.830 
fundamental things about our marine
resources<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.090> organisms<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.630> live<00:04:02.810> in

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
resources and the organisms that live in

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.490 
resources and the organisms that live in
them<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.799> also<00:04:04.400> how<00:04:04.850> we<00:04:05.420> as<00:04:05.570> humans<00:04:05.989> can

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
them and also how we as humans can

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.280 
them and also how we as humans can
impact<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.670> other<00:04:07.790> natural<00:04:08.209> systems<00:04:08.600> there's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
impact the other natural systems there's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.140 
impact the other natural systems there's
lots<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.650> opportunities<00:04:10.190> here<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.610> think<00:04:11.000> that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
lots of opportunities here I think that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.210 
lots of opportunities here I think that
any<00:04:11.360> young<00:04:11.540> scientist<00:04:12.200> could<00:04:12.769> make<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:12.980> whole

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
any young scientist could make a whole

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.490 
any young scientist could make a whole
career<00:04:13.430> studying<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.360> lagoon<00:04:14.690> it's<00:04:15.380> a

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
career studying the lagoon it's a

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.590 
career studying the lagoon it's a
beautiful<00:04:15.860> place<00:04:16.040> it's<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.090> very<00:04:17.120> interesting
