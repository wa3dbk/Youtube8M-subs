00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.100
 hello everyone and welcome to a video 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.830
 more and I'm going to make a brief review and 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.650
 show you of revlon and it's the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 session by browser 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 I know that this is nothing new in the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.810
 This is the test version of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 water the price includes what I got was 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 as for 111 pesos I think that its price 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 regular is around 140 pesos 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.760
 staying here scale with my eye and if you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 they fix the brush hugely and they 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.820
 they can see here they are like three parts 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.720
 here has a part that another part of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 what other part 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.850
 you will see the change and already after 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 we talk so we're going to zoom in on the eye 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.469
 what I like to be to me is first 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.899
 get to the base shake the one side to 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.410
 another and moving it and then pulling it 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.410
 upwards 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.720
 now as the brush is so so big 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.810
 when it came to the eyelashes of 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.820
 center those closest to the lacrimal 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.880
 I have to be very careful because 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 they have several times number one almost 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.930
 I take my eye out and number two I hit the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.520
 brush others and I just stain which 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.649
 it's a huge nuisance 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.429
 especially because this formula is a 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.429
 water proof 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.950
 then you can realize there goes a 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.229
 layer and good have 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.930
 it has something long but above all 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.390
 it has a little volume then it looks 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 very well this mascara has realized 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.420
 that if you are going to add several layers you have 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.390
 to be quickie doing it because 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.780
 then the second layer is then dried 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 we are going to apply it 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.550
 and the second layer what I like is 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.910
 focus more like a pull 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.930
 the brush to the tips to give 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.930
 as longer 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.190
 as you may realize it gives very good 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.739
 volume and gives something long is not it is not 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.769
 the formula that lengthens my lashes 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.590
 but it gives me good volume and I like how 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.269
 for daily use especially the formula 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.299
 now let's put it in the tabs of 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.180
 down and that's a bit more difficult 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.310
 because then the brush is very very large 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.220
 what I try to do is line up one of 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.220
 those of the little fingers of the triangulitos 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.150
 very well then let's talk about my 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.160
 conclusions and the review on this 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.350
 eyelash mask good your formula with 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 amino acid strengthening proteins and 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.630
 essential vitamins helps revitalize 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.080
 the eyelashes your magic wand 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.490
 magical magic subject covers and combs 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.840
 perfectly lashes for a 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.080
 dramatic volume and an elongation 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.270
 free of lumps if the dramatic volume 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.680
 if it gives elongation book of lumps but 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.390
 does not give great elongation it is assumed that the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.710
 goal line is what it does is help 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.380
 that over time grows in your 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.210
 eyelashes I have not noticed that they grow by 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.010
 this but I can tell you that I do not 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.170
 they pull the eyelashes which is already a 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.820
 super extra this brush is pretty 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.220
 great I think that's what helps 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.220
 give the effect of thicker eyelashes 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.380
 more volume but I think it's a brush 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.680
 too big is a big problem 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.070
 for certain types of eyes especially 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.590
 very small eyes eyes of descent 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.260
 Asian so they do not have a basin 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.880
 we run the risk of biting the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.410
 eyelid because the brush is very large and 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.530
 there is very little space you have 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.240
 close to the lacrimal and I also 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.010
 I would move away from this mask of eyelashes 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.030
 this one of this brush, precisely 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.560
 If they have very submerged eyes, the formula 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.810
 I love it and it's my kind of 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.690
 favorite formulas is those formulas 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.910
 that are a little drier I like them 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.430
 a lot because they give a lot of volume I went to a 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.349
 wedding 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.909
 it was out of town I forgot my 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.120
 make-up remover there was no way to 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:17.870
 remove makeup and unfortunately 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.400
 I ended up with almost 20 hours using the 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.280
 eyelash mask which is nothing 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.620
 hygienic I do not recommend them but what 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.979
 good is that you can try it and in those 20 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.870
 hours I did not run a bit 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.550
 keeps curling very well then yes 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.280
 you are people who have problems 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.110
 with keeping your eyelashes curled this 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.300
 will help keep them pretty 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.009
 curly is just the tab 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.840
 favorite for the measures below 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.720
 because it is very difficult not to get stained with 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.400
 is this brush you but the formula 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.800
 works very well las lengga gives them 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.810
 volume and it does not transfer if they use 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.479
 corrector is very creamy they are very heavy 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.630
 sometimes your correctors undo a little 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.060
 mascara and this has not noticed anything of 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.490
 lumps does not become lumps and much less 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.259
 those little groups fall down in general 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.660
 it works very well I think it's one of my 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.460
 of my favorite rivals of the moment 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.470
 had many problems finding 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.090
 mascara is that I like the lately and 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.130
 I can tell you that the positions is 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.670
 one of my favorites remember that it is the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.980
 version 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.680
 of water may they have the version 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.540
 regular work a little bit differently 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.470
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.580
 well tell me what is the next 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.040

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.860
 I want to review because I have many 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.240
 I do not have this max factor which is the 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.430
 more tripis max I have the volume is 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.680
