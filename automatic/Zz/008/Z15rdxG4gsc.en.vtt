00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
over the top to cover the top when you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
over the top to cover the top when you
pull<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.180> thing<00:01:39.390> tight<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
a little hook mechanism to if you wanted

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
a little hook mechanism to if you wanted
to<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> bottom<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.310> believe

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to do that now at the bottom I believe

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.740 
to do that now at the bottom I believe
this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.960> probably<00:01:52.939> an<00:01:53.939> area<00:01:54.119> where<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
this is probably an area where you can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.050 
this is probably an area where you can
have<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.259> rain<00:01:55.470> garden<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.070> hidden<00:01:56.430> away<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
have the rain garden is hidden away of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760 
have the rain garden is hidden away of
course<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.450> pull<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.259> replace

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
course you can pull this out and replace

course you can pull this out and replace
it<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:58.979> something<00:01:59.130> else<00:01:59.310> but<00:02:00.030> you've<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it with something else but you've got a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.899
