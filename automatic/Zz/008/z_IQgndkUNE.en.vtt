00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:15.769
 in the south it is perched near the second largest city of Sicily Catania 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.529
 however, the summit of the weather is often hidden behind a cloud cover 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.079
 also from murders of Paulina offers a similar picture 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.850
 Tau Mina is a very old settlement 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 which existed before the Greek colonization 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.070
 It is located above a cliff and offers otherwise wonderful views 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 just not on the clouded Exner 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 the small town center of Thor Morena 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.049
 is a single tourist hustle and bustle you may not even imagine 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.730
 as it looks here in the summer 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.430
 The Romans built a theater here in the second century AD 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.390
 which is probably unparalleled throughout the Mediterranean, it offered more than 5,000 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.770
 Spectators place 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.670
 and even today theater and opera festivals still take place there 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.870
 the weather better the next day 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.180
 and only at the top of the summit is gardener hanging a few clouds 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.260
 the bus to take us to Rifugio Sapienza 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.440
 4 by a their Noble 4 Tel 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 who do not always make that impression of Kathan year 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 but maybe the leadership layer lives here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.640
 then it goes the mountain side that Bittner out 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.539
 the summit of the Etna is with its 3323 vertical meters now fits cloud-free 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.539
 "Of course we still need to forge a lot of it 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.140
 on both sides of the road recognizes frozen lava flows 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.719
 where the soil is still so young 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.419
 that so far has been able to establish a pioneer vegetation 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.509
 the tourist station Rifugio Sapienza look at almost 2000 meters altitude 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.069
 it was already crazy Sarah Nebelschwaden Hahlen 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.229
 I conclude I am going to drive the hike in 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:53.739
 The cable car St is again 500 meters for a stir at almost 2500 meters 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.739
 brings 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.109
 Since the beginning of the cable car station, the sun is still shining 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.649
 but at this altitude it is still bitterly cold 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:21.159
 Mercedes space is here to bring one to 2020 tenants 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.289
 before can still wait 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.129
 a new crater 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.129
 which was formed in one of the last four auctions 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.269
 when our group l starts to circumnavigate the crater 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.779
 breaks a weather reveal betrayed 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.289
 Mists of fog are everywhere 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.689
 the temperatures within a few minutes 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.689
 Offenburg 15 employees 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.899
 Savings in icy wind commit to go 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.729
 when the gray mists are short 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.019
 they mingle with the long black ones 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.019
 exports of father and two 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.539
 I am so happy 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.289
 go back to the end station of the cable car 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.289
 and drive down again to 2000 meters 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.499
 There is no sign of the weather here 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:36.169
 and I still go to some beside Katern at Refugio 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.309
 the only sparse pioneer vegetation suggests 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.050
 that the near-Earth was not very active here until not very long ago
