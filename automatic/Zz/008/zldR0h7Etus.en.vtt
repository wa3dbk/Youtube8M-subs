00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.720
 teaspoons of salt and put them to fire 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.210
 high 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.880
 I mix a little so that the birds 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.700
 integrate with the water and wait for 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.610
 boil 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.189
 green and I'm going to remove the ends 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.579
 then I'm going to make a small opening 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.610
 with the knife in the middle you have to 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.250
 see that it is not too deep for 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.720
 do not damage the clairvoyant 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 and so they should be 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.830
 once the water is boiling we place 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.890

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.400
 add a pan a spoonful of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.870
 oil and two of butter remember that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.459
 the oil will help the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.459
 butter does not burn 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.750

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.140
 place in this art in garlic suffer 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.920
 ice a little 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.270
 and then add the onion so that the o 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.270

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.630
 finally add the tomato and mix 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.150
 all the ingredients at low heat 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.150
 Leave it there for about 3 or 4 minutes 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.590
 and add a teaspoon of salt and mix 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.050
 girls look how beautiful she is being 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.990
 I did look at the texture that should be left 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.770
 is already reducing the juices to that stew 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.520
 you can add pepper action 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.900
 parsley or cilantro and at this point and 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.299
 it was ready 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.489
 Now I'm going to grate a generous portion 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.560
 of coastal cheese 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.810
 If you do not get that in your dessert 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.599
 city ​​or country uses the most 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.390
 like now I will take the direct 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.790
 lost the way to know when I should 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.650
 take out the unpublished ones is that the cleavage 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.459
 what I did to them in the beginning 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.269
 completely open or insert a 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:55.250
 covered the center of the money and that 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:58.200
 feel very tender then pulled the kilitos 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.769
 and I begin to marinate them with 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.799
 butter that is to taste the idea is 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:09.180
 make a banana puree and add the 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:12.720
 rest of the stew and I continue macerating if 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.239
 I think the puree is very hard, it adds a 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.470
 little more than butter remember that 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.790
 It must be very soft 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.380
 add the coastal cheese to taste 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.380
 and continues macerating 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.949
 until it's completely smooth 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.420
 my street is almost ready now I'm going to 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.420
 plating 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:51.560
 with a ladle placed on the street in 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.560
 the plate and I'm giving it a shape 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.070
 so it does not look messy 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.070
 and have a better presentation 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.420
