00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
here is the solution this is called a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.130 
here is the solution this is called a
Maccabee<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> Sweeney<00:00:45.840> -

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Maccabee and it can also be a Sweeney -

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.279 
Maccabee and it can also be a Sweeney -
it<00:00:46.289> doesn't<00:00:46.469> matter<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.950> brand<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.430> use<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
it doesn't matter what brand you use and

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
it doesn't matter what brand you use and
you<00:00:49.289> need<00:00:49.530> some<00:00:49.860> probes<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:51.300> uncover<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> hole

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
you need some probes to uncover the hole

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.650 
you need some probes to uncover the hole
so<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.340> you'll<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.879> able<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:56.270> put<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> trap

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so that you'll be able to put the trap

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.270 
so that you'll be able to put the trap
and<00:00:57.930> when<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> uncover<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> hole<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.039> want

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and when you uncover the hole you want

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.830 
and when you uncover the hole you want
to<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.550> sure<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> enlarge<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.629> bit

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to make sure and enlarge it a little bit

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.830 
to make sure and enlarge it a little bit
so<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.370> trap<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.390> knick<00:01:03.600> abhi

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
so that your trap this little knick abhi

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
so that your trap this little knick abhi
doesn't<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.350> hung<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> sides<00:01:05.220> it's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
doesn't get hung up on the sides it's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
doesn't get hung up on the sides it's
sort<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> reverse<00:01:06.720> mousetrap<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
sort of like a reverse mousetrap it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500 
sort of like a reverse mousetrap it
works<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> little<00:01:08.250> different<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.299> google

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
works a little different you can google

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
works a little different you can google
it<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.780> find<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.229> exactly<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> works<00:01:11.310> but

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it and find out exactly how it works but

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
it and find out exactly how it works but
you<00:01:11.700> google<00:01:12.180> either<00:01:12.330> MacCabe<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.320> Sweeney<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you google either MacCabe or Sweeney and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
you google either MacCabe or Sweeney and
they're<00:01:15.000> both<00:01:15.150> very<00:01:15.210> similar<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.259> another

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
they're both very similar to one another

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.510 
they're both very similar to one another
so<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.640> we'll<00:01:17.909> begin<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.540> uncover<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> hole

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
so now we'll begin to uncover the hole

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
so now we'll begin to uncover the hole
okay<00:01:20.520> folks<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.240> you've<00:01:21.600> noticed<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.140> I've

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
okay folks now you've noticed that I've

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
okay folks now you've noticed that I've
taken<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.520> whole<00:01:23.759> common<00:01:24.360> garden<00:01:24.659> hole<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
taken a whole common garden hole and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.700 
taken a whole common garden hole and
I've<00:01:25.140> raked<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.920> dirt<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:27.080> where<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I've raked the dirt off of where the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
I've raked the dirt off of where the
mound<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:29.970> see<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> hole<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.750> now

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
mound was you don't see a hole right now

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
mound was you don't see a hole right now
because<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> probe<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
because we have to probe for it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.240 
because we have to probe for it
so<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.240> yourself<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.750> suitable<00:01:34.590> probe<00:01:34.890> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so get yourself a suitable probe like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.410 
so get yourself a suitable probe like
something<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> these<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:39.270> will

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
something like one of these and you will

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.490 
something like one of these and you will
then<00:01:39.680> probe<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.920> hole<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.990> tend<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> expand

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
then probe that hole and tend to expand

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.330 
then probe that hole and tend to expand
it<00:01:43.680> while<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.329> turn<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.750> off

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
it while I do this I will turn this off

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
it while I do this I will turn this off
okay<00:01:47.340> folks<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.939> found<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.390> hole<00:01:48.570> there

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
okay folks now I found the hole there

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
okay folks now I found the hole there
because<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.619> prod<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> pried<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> around

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
because my prod I pried it around

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
because my prod I pried it around
several<00:01:51.630> different<00:01:51.960> spots<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> was<00:01:52.619> about

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
several different spots and it was about

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.010 
several different spots and it was about
the<00:01:53.009> center<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> mound<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.090> these

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the center of what the mound was these

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
the center of what the mound was these
holes<00:01:55.380> by<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.219> pretty<00:01:56.430> well<00:01:56.610> plugged

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
holes by the way are pretty well plugged

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
holes by the way are pretty well plugged
with<00:01:57.090> dirt<00:01:57.329> down<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
with dirt down there so you have to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
with dirt down there so you have to
probe<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.540> after<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
probe them a little bit and after you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
probe them a little bit and after you
probe<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.079> you'll<00:02:01.229> open<00:02:01.409> them<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.479> you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
probe them you'll open them up and you

come back and up trying to fill it up so

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.990 
come back and up trying to fill it up so
he<00:02:09.539> can't<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.080> daylight<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> that's<00:02:11.000> the

okay folks you can see how deep these
things<00:02:16.710> are<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.130> run<00:02:17.340> sometimes<00:02:17.880> 8<00:02:18.780> 10<00:02:19.170> 12

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500

hose drawing it back out of there and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.420 
hose drawing it back out of there and
this<00:03:03.390> will<00:03:03.540> dig<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.080> little<00:03:04.410> bit<00:03:04.740> faster

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
this will dig it out a little bit faster

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.310 
this will dig it out a little bit faster
and<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:06.360> won't<00:03:06.540> hurt<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.870> little<00:03:07.020> fella

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
trap set down into the hole with a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.560 
trap set down into the hole with a
little<00:03:48.870> paddle<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:50.580> trigger<00:03:50.820> set<00:03:51.240> into

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
little paddle and the trigger set into

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.880 
little paddle and the trigger set into
it<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.780> you'll<00:03:51.960> have<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.200> learn<00:03:52.410> how<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.650> do

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
it now you'll have to learn how to do

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.260 
it now you'll have to learn how to do
that<00:03:53.040> it'll<00:03:53.220> take<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> few<00:03:53.820> seconds<00:03:54.180> to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
that it'll take you a few seconds to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.320 
that it'll take you a few seconds to
figure<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.660> out<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:54.960> unlike<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> mousetrap<00:03:56.330> it

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
figure it out but unlike a mousetrap it

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.550 
figure it out but unlike a mousetrap it
goes<00:03:58.760> underneath<00:03:59.760> rather<00:04:00.720> than<00:04:00.960> over<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.350> top

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
goes underneath rather than over the top

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.610 
goes underneath rather than over the top
and<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:03.300> might<00:04:03.750> hold<00:04:03.930> your<00:04:04.140> thumb<00:04:04.350> on<00:04:04.380> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and you might hold your thumb on the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.170 
and you might hold your thumb on the
