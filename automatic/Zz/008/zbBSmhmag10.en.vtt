00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
kind of dark the dark background makes

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.740 
kind of dark the dark background makes
it<00:05:39.900> hard<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.170> read<00:05:40.490> so<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.520> recommend<00:05:42.120> making<00:05:42.480> a

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
it hard to read so I recommend making a

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.390 
it hard to read so I recommend making a
lighter<00:05:42.960> background<00:05:43.230> or<00:05:43.710> which<00:05:44.100> would<00:05:44.250> be

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
lighter background or which would be

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.030 
lighter background or which would be
better<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:44.910> to<00:05:45.020> get<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.050> picture<00:05:46.410> associated

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
better is to get a picture associated

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.410 
better is to get a picture associated
with<00:05:47.220> that<00:05:47.340> contact<00:05:49.700> well<00:05:50.700> that's<00:05:50.940> just<00:05:51.210> about
