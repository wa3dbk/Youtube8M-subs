then I take the rest of my hair and I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.530 
then I take the rest of my hair and I
put<00:01:50.540> make<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.049> into<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.440> really<00:01:52.150> simple<00:01:53.150> quick

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
put make it into a really simple quick

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.120 
put make it into a really simple quick
fun<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.290> doesn't<00:01:54.619> have<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.950> look<00:01:55.070> perfect

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
fun and it doesn't have to look perfect

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.840 
fun and it doesn't have to look perfect
it<00:01:55.760> can<00:01:55.970> look<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.330> little<00:01:56.360> messy<00:01:57.190> but<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.820> just

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it can look a little messy but that just

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.590 
it can look a little messy but that just
adds<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.869> whole<00:01:59.900> look<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.830> um<00:02:01.390> there<00:02:02.390> you

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
adds to the whole look so um there you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.440 
adds to the whole look so um there you
go

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
go

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.899 
go
so<00:02:05.320> pretty<00:02:05.560> much<00:02:05.649> it<00:02:05.920> just<00:02:06.009> take<00:02:06.219> a<00:02:06.250> brush<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:06.820> a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909
