they're<00:01:22.110> six<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.180> reading<00:01:24.509> was

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
they're six so what I was reading was

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.710 
they're six so what I was reading was
that<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.520> player<00:01:26.520> kept<00:01:26.820> good<00:01:27.000> shooting<00:01:27.390> puck

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that a player kept good shooting puck

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
that a player kept good shooting puck
skills<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.500> skating<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.460> helped<00:01:29.640> your

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
skills and skating so that helped your

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
skills and skating so that helped your
often<00:01:30.210> Stephanie<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.950> bad

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
often Stephanie but they could have bad

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270 
often Stephanie but they could have bad
like<00:01:32.490> physical<00:01:33.420> senses<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.990> defense<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.159> they

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
like physical senses and defense so they

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.789 
like physical senses and defense so they
could<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> 75<00:01:36.299> /<00:01:36.450> reading<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
could be like a 75 / reading but that

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
could be like a 75 / reading but that
suks<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.749 
suks just like really good in all the
categories<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:39.960> why<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.110> 95<00:01:40.759> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
categories so that's why it's 95 but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
categories so that's why it's 95 but
really<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.090> 75<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:43.740> shooting

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
really is 75 with the good shooting
skating<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.579> puck<00:01:44.909> skills<00:01:45.090> could<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
skating and puck skills could be on the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
skating and puck skills could be on the
first<00:01:46.079> line<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.909> could<00:01:48.090> help<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
first line because that could help the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.670 
first line because that could help the
first<00:01:48.540> line<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.140> might<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:49.470> oh<00:01:49.649> ow

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

first line but you might think oh ow
he's<00:01:49.979> 75<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.909> he's<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.810> terrible<00:01:52.200> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
he's 75 so he's got to be terrible but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.940 
he's 75 so he's got to be terrible but
not<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.729> NHL<00:01:54.329> 10<00:01:54.810> well<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
not really in NHL 10 well this is just

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
not really in NHL 10 well this is just
picture<00:01:56.310> 10<00:01:56.579> 11<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.180> 12<00:01:57.240> basically<00:01:58.079> serves

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
picture 10 11 and 12 basically serves

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.889 
picture 10 11 and 12 basically serves
three<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.770> each<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.509> much

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
three in each one but it's much

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.520 
three in each one but it's much
different<00:02:01.140> than<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:03.750> there's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
different than then because like there's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
different than then because like there's
only<00:02:04.619> three<00:02:04.860> category<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
only three category so and then the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.859 
only three category so and then the
stats<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.849> if<00:02:08.849> passing<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.750> like

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
stats back then like if passing was like

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.290 
stats back then like if passing was like
a<00:02:09.899> 50<00:02:10.440> he<00:02:10.649> probably<00:02:10.890> still<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.190> like<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> 91<00:02:11.940> 92

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
a 50 he probably still be like a 91 92

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.930 
a 50 he probably still be like a 91 92
so<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.379> there<00:02:13.590> for

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
so it's there for

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.420 
so it's there for
so<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.390> my<00:02:15.540> opinion<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.130> change

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
so in my opinion I think with the change

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.030 
so in my opinion I think with the change
of<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.760> stats<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.720> should<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.410> pretty<00:02:19.740> cool

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
of the stats it should be pretty cool

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100 
of the stats it should be pretty cool
because<00:02:20.420> instead<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> everyone<00:02:21.810> being<00:02:21.930> like

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because instead of everyone being like

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.130 
because instead of everyone being like
an<00:02:22.200> 80<00:02:22.410> overall<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.250> child<00:02:23.550> 12<00:02:24.140> what

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
an 80 overall in a child 12 what

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.660 
an 80 overall in a child 12 what
generally<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.950> much<00:02:26.100> because<00:02:26.250> every

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
generally like that much because every

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
generally like that much because every
player<00:02:26.910> was<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.240> an<00:02:27.330> ad<00:02:27.510> or<00:02:27.630> around<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.350> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
player was like an ad or around like a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.210 
player was like an ad or around like a
de<00:02:28.770> 182<00:02:29.520> now<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.750> players<00:02:30.990> at<00:02:31.200> 75<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:32.070> might

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
de 182 now like players at 75 you might

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.920 
de 182 now like players at 75 you might
think<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.550> out<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.760> their<00:02:32.880> terrible<00:02:33.510> trade

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
think all out of their terrible trade

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.330 
think all out of their terrible trade
them<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.350> nothing<00:02:34.860> they<00:02:35.280> could

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
them for like nothing they could

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.950 
them for like nothing they could
actually<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.850> good<00:02:36.030> players<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.690> because

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
actually be good players just because

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.060 
actually be good players just because
players<00:02:37.290> are<00:02:37.500> not<00:02:37.590> looking<00:02:37.830> at<00:02:37.950> their

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
players are not looking at their

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.730 
players are not looking at their
individual<00:02:38.610> stats<00:02:38.850> if<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:40.350> look<00:02:40.500> at<00:02:40.620> those

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
individual stats if you look at those

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.440 
individual stats if you look at those
stats<00:02:41.070> they<00:02:41.610> could<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.970> could<00:02:42.120> find<00:02:42.300> like

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
stats they could you could find like

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.670 
stats they could you could find like
really<00:02:42.720> good<00:02:42.840> players<00:02:43.080> with<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.470> low

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
really good players with like low

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160 
really good players with like low
ratings<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.700> could<00:02:44.850> help<00:02:44.940> your<00:02:45.120> team<00:02:45.300> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
ratings what could help your team so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.160 
ratings what could help your team so
like<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.950> my<00:02:47.220> opinion<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.450> it's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
like that's my opinion I think that it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.410 
like that's my opinion I think that it's
going<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.560> not<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.790> after<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.210> off

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
going to be not like it after it but off

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.480 
going to be not like it after it but off
the<00:02:51.480> scene<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.050> demo<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
the scene like the demo and like the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.730 
the scene like the demo and like the
game<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.390> i<00:02:54.690> don't<00:02:55.110> know<00:02:55.170> i<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.320> it's<00:02:55.620> going

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
game but i don't know i think it's going

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.190 
game but i don't know i think it's going
to<00:02:55.800> be<00:02:55.950> cool<00:02:56.220> at<00:02:56.580> first<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.020> see

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to be cool at first like just to see

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.830 
to be cool at first like just to see
like<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.740> how<00:02:59.400> everyone's<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.120> rated

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
like all the how everyone's like rated

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.590 
like all the how everyone's like rated
differently<00:03:01.230> basically<00:03:01.790> but<00:03:02.790> i<00:03:03.090> don't<00:03:03.510> know<00:03:03.540> i

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
differently basically but i don't know i

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.660 
differently basically but i don't know i
think<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.590> good<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.280> still

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
think it's going to be good I still

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.600 
think it's going to be good I still
think<00:03:05.700> doubles<00:03:06.210> are<00:03:06.330> underrated<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.610> don't

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
think doubles are underrated but I don't

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.130 
think doubles are underrated but I don't
know<00:03:08.670> we'll<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.210> see<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> demo<00:03:09.720> which

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
know we'll have to see in the demo which

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.550 
know we'll have to see in the demo which
