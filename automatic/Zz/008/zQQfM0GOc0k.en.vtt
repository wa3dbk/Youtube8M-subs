00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.410
 Welcome dear people to one

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.610
 Names return of the burning legion 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.460
 I have the legendary questreihe today 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.860
 so far that I have my item level 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.320
 Got 600 cape and yes I say 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 times in my eyes is the coming 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.620
 Dialogue between che and drove orion 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.930
 extremely interesting and could already 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.040
 almost a view of the coming 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.820
 give extension 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.160
 but just listen to what they do 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.379
 has to say here or what for orion and 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.180
 has to say the same and I will 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.989
 right back at the end of the video 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 a little theory 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.869
 I ask your blessings of hope so 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.180
 so the child of the world crusher the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.410
 Proof that we are all to blame 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.649
 make up for it 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:26.950
 worth a visit does not tell me son of 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:31.929
 Earthguard where is the nature of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.910
 hope hope is a belief 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.520
 a better future 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.360
 you speak but doubt yours 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 own words 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.100
 big crane I you have not seen 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.970
 what I have seen is underestimated 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.740
 me the fires that once hit the sky 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.560
 Brand returned swept 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.560
 it is inevitably the burning one 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.170
 Legion will find azeroth oceans 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.110
 blood cities in rubble how should we 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 a divided world of the region 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.920
 command 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.320
 you speak of hope believe me only 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.180
 the slightest hope that we 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.670
 the coming destruction somehow 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.150
 survive protects me from the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.820
 despair stands on son of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.370
 Deathwing I give you my blessing 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.200
 because you need him more than all of them 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.650
 I understand so far 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.980
 hope not in the sense of a vague and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.770
 unimaginable future lives every day 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.110
 with hope in your heart like that 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:50.080
 do you create the future of their 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:53.019
 you have dreamed you have heard yourself chichi 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.500
 said an unimaginable future 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.850
 but I do not know so pru that sounds 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.489
 now everything is pretty blatant 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.560
 especially if you are a bit nice 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.670
 the story of the burning legion 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.080
 followed there are still some 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.910
 I just say famous legionnaires 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.760
 either only half 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.650
 were expelled as for example yes in the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.260
 sun fountain plateau we have on 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.640
 end not killed but just just stop 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.290
 sold in half 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.350
 otherwise another interesting 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.910
 character is of course saying rus is 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.160
 unknown where the currently resides 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.070
 speculation simply goes there the world 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.890
 from argus to and argos is as far as me 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.920
 I am informed a stronghold of the fires 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.450
 lays the burning legion as well 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.330
 homeland of honor of which of course 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.060
 also split off the draenei well 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.130
 or something to do with it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.960
 and yes there up there is the 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.690
 fallen titania sa 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.230
 stop it I say so it is 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.310
 interesting what furore and that said 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.580
 has in my eyes 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.290
 and yes the bit more detailed 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.780
 You can find articles in the video below 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.610
 that was just the video for now 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.790
 the article and I say so far 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.790
 is good
