00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
question can this ever happen again very

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.989 
question can this ever happen again very
often<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.889> see<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.190> religions<00:01:01.579> originated

often you see that religions originated
in<00:01:02.120> times<00:01:02.389> of<00:01:02.539> upheaval<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:04.100> where

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
in times of upheaval and and where

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.649 
in times of upheaval and and where
nothing<00:01:04.549> seems<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.850> be<00:01:05.000> just<00:01:05.210> there<00:01:05.449> seems<00:01:05.630> to

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
nothing seems to be just there seems to

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.060 
nothing seems to be just there seems to
be<00:01:05.750> no<00:01:05.870> justice<00:01:06.320> that's<00:01:06.830> when<00:01:06.950> people

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
be no justice that's when people

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.310 
be no justice that's when people
actually<00:01:07.520> turn<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.729> religion<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.450> because<00:01:09.230> of

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
actually turn to religion and because of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.600 
actually turn to religion and because of
course<00:01:09.500> very<00:01:09.680> often<00:01:09.890> there's<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.130> promise<00:01:10.460> that

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
course very often there's a promise that

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.240 
course very often there's a promise that
in<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.940> end<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.630> will<00:01:11.780> be<00:01:11.930> rewarded

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
in the end you will be rewarded

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.890 
in the end you will be rewarded
sometimes<00:01:13.250> even<00:01:13.460> after<00:01:13.580> death<00:01:13.940> etc<00:01:14.120> but<00:01:14.840> that

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
sometimes even after death etc but that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.510 
sometimes even after death etc but that
sense<00:01:15.230> in<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:15.530> need<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.860> justice<00:01:16.220> is<00:01:16.310> really

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
sense in that need of justice is really

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.550 
sense in that need of justice is really
something<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.990> especially<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:18.320> look<00:01:18.470> at

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
something that especially if you look at

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.720 
something that especially if you look at
it<00:01:18.620> from<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.830> philosophical<00:01:19.010> point<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.670> view

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
it from a philosophical point of view

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.890 
it from a philosophical point of view
it's<00:01:20.240> really<00:01:20.450> interesting

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
it's really interesting

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.560 
it's really interesting
apparently<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.830> very<00:01:22.400> profound<00:01:22.880> need<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.480> we

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
apparently a very profound need that we

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.860 
apparently a very profound need that we
have<00:01:23.720> for<00:01:23.870> justice<00:01:24.230> sort<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.160> sparks<00:01:25.870> are

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
have for justice sort of sparks are

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.990 
have for justice sort of sparks are
interested<00:01:27.260> in<00:01:27.350> religion<00:01:27.680> basically

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000

although<00:02:20.950> there's<00:02:21.190> more<00:02:21.430> information<00:02:21.580> out

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
although there's more information out

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.030 
although there's more information out
there<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.500> making<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
there I don't think that's making the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.940 
there I don't think that's making the
issue<00:02:24.340> less<00:02:24.790> complicated<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:26.080> complicates

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
issue less complicated it complicates

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.220 
issue less complicated it complicates
the<00:02:27.100> issue<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:27.880> people<00:02:28.020> who<00:02:29.020> aren't

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the issue more because people who aren't

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.290 
the issue more because people who aren't
intelligent<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> hard<00:02:30.640> time<00:02:30.910> are

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
intelligent or have a hard time are

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.240 
intelligent or have a hard time are
being<00:02:31.600> bombarded<00:02:31.750> by<00:02:32.200> facts<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:32.860> we<00:02:33.070> don't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
being bombarded by facts and we don't

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.150 
being bombarded by facts and we don't
even<00:02:33.490> know<00:02:33.780> people<00:02:34.780> like<00:02:35.230> us<00:02:35.380> who<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:35.980> at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
even know people like us who are at

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.910 
even know people like us who are at
university<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.210> are<00:02:37.810> supposed<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.590> be<00:02:38.710> smart

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
university and are supposed to be smart

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.850 
university and are supposed to be smart
it's<00:02:39.880> really<00:02:40.180> hard<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.660> us<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.080> discern<00:02:41.470> what

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
it's really hard for us to discern what

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.280 
it's really hard for us to discern what
is<00:02:41.890> true<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.490> what<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.910> true<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.600> actually

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
is true and what is not true I actually

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.350 
is true and what is not true I actually
didn't<00:02:44.710> said<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.100> was<00:02:45.190> impossible<00:02:45.490> I<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.210> just

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
didn't said it was impossible I was just

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.180 
didn't said it was impossible I was just
saying<00:02:46.570> was<00:02:46.780> getting<00:02:47.190> increasingly

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
saying was getting increasingly

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.510 
saying was getting increasingly
difficult<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.800> know<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:51.160> are<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.340> lot<00:02:51.400> of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
difficult and I know there are a lot of

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.400 
difficult and I know there are a lot of
sex<00:02:52.030> still<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:52.660> still<00:02:52.870> hard<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.170> know

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
sex still and it's still hard to know

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.470 
sex still and it's still hard to know
what's<00:02:54.010> true<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.280> what's<00:02:54.520> not<00:02:54.580> but<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.270> believe

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
what's true and what's not but I believe

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.060 
what's true and what's not but I believe
it's<00:02:56.110> getting<00:02:56.410> more<00:02:56.530> difficult<00:02:56.680> because

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
it's getting more difficult because

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.740 
it's getting more difficult because
there's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.460> lot<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.670> criticism<00:02:58.210> from

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
there's a lot of criticism from

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.110 
there's a lot of criticism from
everywhere<00:02:59.530> right<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> mean<00:03:00.670> as<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
everywhere right but the I mean as the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.340 
everywhere right but the I mean as the
Chris's<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.540> create<00:03:01.750> also<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.020> complexity

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
Chris's we create also the complexity

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.430 
Chris's we create also the complexity
increases<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:02.920> that's<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.130> big<00:03:03.250> problem

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
increases and that's a big problem

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.480 
increases and that's a big problem
realize<00:03:05.440> your<00:03:05.620> point<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.190> know<00:03:06.280> having

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
realize your point that you know having

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.560 
realize your point that you know having
the<00:03:06.640> internet<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.270> doesn't<00:03:07.480> necessarily

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
the internet that doesn't necessarily

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.330 
the internet that doesn't necessarily
make<00:03:08.050> things<00:03:08.290> easier<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.770> makes<00:03:08.830> them<00:03:09.040> harder

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
make things easier it makes them harder

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.590 
make things easier it makes them harder
because<00:03:09.460> you<00:03:09.970> have<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.120> make<00:03:10.330> up<00:03:10.420> your<00:03:10.540> mind

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
because you have to make up your mind

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.450 
because you have to make up your mind
there's<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.080> much<00:03:11.200> information<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.950> then<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
there's so much information and then the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.340 
there's so much information and then the
tendency<00:03:12.640> or<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.030> temptation<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.110> sort<00:03:14.320> of

tendency or the temptation to sort of

tendency or the temptation to sort of
make<00:03:14.560> everything<00:03:14.860> simple<00:03:15.370> becomes<00:03:15.670> common

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
make everything simple becomes common

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.460 
make everything simple becomes common
becomes<00:03:16.270> very<00:03:16.420> hard<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.930> even<00:03:17.080> sects<00:03:17.380> have

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
becomes very hard and even sects have

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.750 
becomes very hard and even sects have
found<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.800> way<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.130> Internet<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.460> course

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
found the way to the Internet of course

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.280 
found the way to the Internet of course
that's<00:03:19.030> how<00:03:19.120> they<00:03:19.300> recruit<00:03:19.540> very<00:03:19.810> often<00:03:20.110> so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
that's how they recruit very often so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.680 
that's how they recruit very often so
but<00:03:20.860> well<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.820> guess<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.090> mean<00:03:22.180> you're<00:03:22.300> both<00:03:22.390> in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
but well I guess I mean you're both in

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.330 
but well I guess I mean you're both in
your<00:03:22.960> ways<00:03:23.170> if<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.500> both<00:03:23.650> have<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:23.860> point<00:03:24.100> so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
your ways if you both have a point so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.010 
your ways if you both have a point so
it's<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.670> guess<00:03:24.820> it's<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.540> point<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:25.990> to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
it's I guess it's the point is just to

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.320 
it's I guess it's the point is just to
remain<00:03:26.380> aware<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.740> that<00:03:26.860> yes<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.580> now<00:03:31.030> no

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
remain aware of that yes and now no

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.260 
remain aware of that yes and now no
concluding<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.960> remarks<00:03:32.500> accept<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.190> even<00:03:33.910> if

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
concluding the remarks accept it even if

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.350 
concluding the remarks accept it even if
we<00:03:35.260> think<00:03:35.470> well<00:03:35.920> we<00:03:36.100> are<00:03:36.250> intelligent<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
we think well we are intelligent and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.830 
we think well we are intelligent and
let's<00:03:37.600> let's<00:03:38.020> presume<00:03:38.590> we<00:03:38.860> are<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.570> feel<00:03:40.570> that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
let's let's presume we are I feel that

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.320 
let's let's presume we are I feel that
we<00:03:40.990> are<00:03:41.140> more<00:03:41.650> vulnerable<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.580> all<00:03:42.820> kinds<00:03:43.300> of

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
we are more vulnerable to all kinds of

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.010 
we are more vulnerable to all kinds of
things<00:03:43.390> then<00:03:43.990> you<00:03:44.230> might<00:03:44.890> think<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:45.810> if<00:03:46.810> you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
things then you might think so if you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.290 
things then you might think so if you
take<00:03:47.380> away<00:03:47.530> your<00:03:47.860> certainty<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.970> you

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
take away your certainty and you you

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300 
take away your certainty and you you
have<00:03:49.450> nothing<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.410> people<00:03:50.740> turn<00:03:50.920> away<00:03:51.070> from

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
have nothing and people turn away from
