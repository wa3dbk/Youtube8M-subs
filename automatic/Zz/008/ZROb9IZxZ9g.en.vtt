00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.420
 spaghetti bolognese already stopped like that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.190

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.910
 hardly spaghetti bolognese 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.470
 inside xtreme come because of the cottage 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.500

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.090
 but I have no ufermann yet 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.770
 I can leave right away 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.450
 Throw on the stage that is one 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.450
 common man also had one 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.380
 how much you spaghetti bolognese today 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.300
 So get the 20 20 clock 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.920
 polonaise okay there must be a lot 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.150
 goes with the jörg bausch what was so 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.550
 a bit exotic today what the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.620
 so I have one 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.080
 sour cabbage 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.370
 get the recipe that is very tasty 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.110
 So I would like to change that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.890
 write off the concept around the same 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.390
 try and you were you instance 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.400
 So the resonance is very big class 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.780
 as you can see there are many of them 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.480
 give us the recipes 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.160
 and of course we as nahkauf us yes 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.600
 then present very well 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.610
 and that's very important too 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.010
 we do something to get known 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.840
 actions the halo corner runs great 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.120
 So we already have over 50 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.820
 Recipes collected and the onslaught of 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.020
 Fans are right course of construction sites 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.370
 quite deliberately that does not bring 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.400
 only the Oberhausen arena to cook 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.950
 is also the nahkauf cook study makes 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.800
 So he turned out to be a celebrity chef 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.540
 the customers partly do not know that 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.430
 here in the Ruhr area and we have it 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.180
 naturally told and so very enthusiastic 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.180
 and join in 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.230
 that is nobody 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.610
 the battery 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.610
 always
