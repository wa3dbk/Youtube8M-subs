00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
really easy to make they are just two

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.060 
triangles with an oval in the center
normally<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.320> white<00:00:40.590> acrylic<00:00:40.890> paint

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
normally I would use white acrylic paint

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
normally I would use white acrylic paint
for<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.030> ran<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> am

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
for this but I ran out of that so I am

00:00:43.379 --> 00:01:02.550 
for this but I ran out of that so I am
using<00:00:43.620> French<00:00:44.100> white<00:00:44.430> cream<00:00:44.820> by<00:00:45.180> wet<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> wild

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.170 

using<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:03.680> same<00:01:03.890> white<00:01:04.160> connect<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.730> bows<00:01:04.940> to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
using the same white connect the bows to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
using the same white connect the bows to
the<00:01:05.300> edges<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.900> your<00:01:05.930> nails<00:01:06.290> with<00:01:06.680> some<00:01:06.950> lines

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.440 

then<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.010> can<00:01:18.190> outline<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.790> bows<00:01:19.030> with<00:01:19.270> a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
then you can outline the bows with a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.690 
then you can outline the bows with a
different<00:01:19.990> color<00:01:20.230> as<00:01:20.530> well<00:01:20.830> as<00:01:21.070> add<00:01:21.310> two
