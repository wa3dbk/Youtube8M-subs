00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.140 

and<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.720> like<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.080> layer<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.320> lot<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:11.830> times<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
and I like to layer a lot of times it

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.210 
and I like to layer a lot of times it
just<00:01:13.210> really<00:01:14.140> looks<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.620> better<00:01:14.830> when<00:01:15.100> you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
just really looks and better when you

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.310 
just really looks and better when you
can<00:01:15.400> just<00:01:15.640> go<00:01:16.000> over<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.390> several<00:01:16.900> times<00:01:17.200> with

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
can just go over it several times with

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.370 
can just go over it several times with
another<00:01:18.280> color<00:01:18.640> another<00:01:19.330> really<00:01:19.840> important

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
another color another really important

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.410 
another color another really important
step<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.890> we're<00:01:21.310> really<00:01:21.520> emphasizing<00:01:21.640> eyes

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
step and we're really emphasizing eyes

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
also a really important step is to do a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.200 
also a really important step is to do a
quick<00:01:32.470> little<00:01:32.650> test<00:01:33.070> make<00:01:33.729> sure<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:34.120> you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
quick little test make sure that you

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.770 
quick little test make sure that you
don't<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:34.630> any<00:01:34.780> skin<00:01:35.320> in<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:36.780> curler

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
don't have any skin in that curler

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.800 
don't have any skin in that curler
before<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.370> clamp<00:01:39.370> down<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.570> want<00:01:40.750> a

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
before you clamp down and you want a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.899 
before you clamp down and you want a
clamp<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.470> then<00:01:41.740> work<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.220> all<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.760> way<00:01:42.880> up

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
clamp and then work it all the way up

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.550 
clamp and then work it all the way up
the<00:01:43.299> eye<00:01:43.330> so<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.870> don't<00:01:44.049> have<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.530> short

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
the eye so you don't have just a short

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.240 
the eye so you don't have just a short
Bend<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.850> want<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.090> have<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.270> nice<00:01:47.020> curl<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:48.159> a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
Bend you want to have a nice curl and a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.500 
Bend you want to have a nice curl and a
nice<00:01:48.990> roundedness<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.830> lashes<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
nice roundedness to the lashes do the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.649 
nice roundedness to the lashes do the
same<00:01:52.750> thing<00:01:52.990> on<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.170> other<00:01:53.260> eye<00:01:54.659> again

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
same thing on the other eye again

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.120 
same thing on the other eye again
testing<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.290> make<00:01:56.440> sure<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.619> don't<00:01:56.740> have<00:01:56.979> her

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
testing to make sure I don't have her

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:08.660 
testing to make sure I don't have her
skin<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.670> there<00:01:57.930> before<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:58.960> fully<00:01:59.400> okay

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.280 

I'm<00:02:09.670> gonna<00:02:09.789> go<00:02:09.940> ahead<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.209> put<00:02:10.330> some<00:02:10.360> lashes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
I'm gonna go ahead and put some lashes

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.150 
I'm gonna go ahead and put some lashes
on<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.500> outer<00:02:11.709> edges<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:16.890> these<00:02:17.890> take<00:02:18.130> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
on the outer edges just these take a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.710 
on the outer edges just these take a
little<00:02:18.459> bit<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.640> practice<00:02:18.880> you're<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.540> have

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
little bit of practice you're gonna have

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.630 
little bit of practice you're gonna have
to<00:02:19.810> try<00:02:20.020> these<00:02:20.080> probably<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> few<00:02:21.130> times<00:02:21.370> before

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
to try these probably a few times before

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.360 
to try these probably a few times before
you<00:02:21.940> can<00:02:22.120> really<00:02:22.420> master<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.230> at<00:02:23.349> home<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.280> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
you can really master it at home it's a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.430 
you can really master it at home it's a
little<00:02:24.610> trickier<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.540> do<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.810> on<00:02:25.930> yourself

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
little trickier to do it on yourself

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.009 
little trickier to do it on yourself
than<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.160> do<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.550> somebody<00:02:27.819> else<00:02:28.030> but

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
than it is to do it on somebody else but

in<00:04:24.140> with<00:04:24.170> what<00:04:24.470> I've<00:04:24.560> already<00:04:24.740> done<00:04:24.920> by<00:04:25.250> just

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
in with what I've already done by just

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.070 
in with what I've already done by just
going<00:04:25.760> over<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:26.120> again<00:04:26.450> with<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> eye

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
going over that again with the eye

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.800 
going over that again with the eye
shadow<00:04:27.260> brush<00:04:27.920> I'm<00:04:28.820> gonna<00:04:28.970> finish<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.780> off

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
shadow brush I'm gonna finish that off

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.380 
shadow brush I'm gonna finish that off
with<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.170> coat<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.470> mascara<00:04:30.680> for<00:04:31.580> two<00:04:31.850> or<00:04:32.120> three

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
with a coat of mascara for two or three

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.900 
with a coat of mascara for two or three
that<00:04:33.020> may<00:04:33.169> seem<00:04:33.380> like<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.560> lot<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.340> that's

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
that may seem like a lot but that's

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.690 
that may seem like a lot but that's
another<00:04:35.360> trick<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:36.140> really<00:04:36.680> having<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.370> high

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
another trick to really having a high

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.180 
another trick to really having a high
impact<00:04:38.150> look<00:04:38.450> sometimes<00:04:39.290> as<00:04:39.470> many<00:04:39.620> as<00:04:39.770> three

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
impact look sometimes as many as three

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.540 
impact look sometimes as many as three
maybe<00:04:40.730> four<00:04:41.090> coats<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.780> mascara<00:04:41.960> or<00:04:42.680> cried<00:04:42.950> I'm

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
maybe four coats of mascara or cried I'm

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.310 
maybe four coats of mascara or cried I'm
going<00:04:43.880> ahead<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.210> just<00:04:44.510> putting<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.960> coat<00:04:45.169> on

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
going ahead and just putting a coat on

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.770 
going ahead and just putting a coat on
each<00:04:45.560> lap<00:04:46.040> each<00:04:46.430> eye<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.240> then<00:04:47.390> I'm<00:04:47.540> going<00:04:47.660> to

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
each lap each eye and then I'm going to

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.510 
each lap each eye and then I'm going to
comb<00:04:47.960> through<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.320> with<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.830> eyelash<00:04:49.190> comb

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
comb through that with the eyelash comb

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.560 
comb through that with the eyelash comb
I<00:04:50.530> like<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.710> use<00:04:52.040> an<00:04:52.220> eyelash<00:04:52.580> comb<00:04:52.970> between

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
I like to use an eyelash comb between

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.600 
I like to use an eyelash comb between
each<00:04:53.780> coat<00:04:54.110> because<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.800> just<00:04:55.100> takes<00:04:55.490> the

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
each coat because it just takes the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.480 
each coat because it just takes the
clumps<00:04:56.180> out<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.810> gives<00:04:57.560> them<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.950> a<00:04:58.280> more

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
clumps out and gives them a a more

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.420 
clumps out and gives them a a more
natural<00:04:59.030> look<00:04:59.360> it<00:05:00.080> also<00:05:00.230> helps<00:05:00.770> separate

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
natural look it also helps separate

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.590 
natural look it also helps separate
these<00:05:01.669> lashes<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.880> I'm<00:05:05.030> gonna<00:05:05.180> go<00:05:05.360> ahead<00:05:05.479> and

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
these lashes and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.230 
these lashes and I'm gonna go ahead and
do<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> second<00:05:06.290> coat<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.860> I'm<00:05:07.550> gonna<00:05:07.700> go<00:05:07.970> as

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
do a second coat and I'm gonna go as

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.230 
do a second coat and I'm gonna go as
close<00:05:08.540> into<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.260> lash<00:05:09.560> base<00:05:10.370> of<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.669> lash<00:05:10.850> as

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
close into that lash base of the lash as

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.210 
close into that lash base of the lash as
I<00:05:11.390> can<00:05:11.630> wiggle<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.650> little<00:05:12.680> bit

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
I can wiggle it a little bit

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.120 
I can wiggle it a little bit
I'm<00:05:13.760> not<00:05:13.940> going<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.450> all<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.620> way<00:05:15.740> into<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
I'm not going to all the way into the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.430 
I'm not going to all the way into the
inner<00:05:16.310> eye<00:05:16.640> area<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.330> part<00:05:17.630> again<00:05:17.960> because<00:05:18.290> I'm

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
inner eye area in part again because I'm

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.310 
inner eye area in part again because I'm
trying<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.830> focus<00:05:19.310> on<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.610> outer<00:05:19.850> edge<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:21.110> her

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
trying to focus on the outer edge of her

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.010 
trying to focus on the outer edge of her
eye<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:22.190> that'll<00:05:22.520> be<00:05:22.640> a<00:05:22.669> good<00:05:22.940> place<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.270> put<00:05:23.750> a

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
eye and that'll be a good place to put a

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.240 
eye and that'll be a good place to put a
third<00:05:24.500> little<00:05:25.370> dab<00:05:26.240> of<00:05:26.270> mascara<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.470> also<00:05:27.979> like

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
to use a good volumizing mascara to

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.469 
to use a good volumizing mascara to
really<00:05:31.100> emphasize<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.820> eyes<00:05:31.940> have<00:05:32.450> a

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
really emphasize the eyes have a

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.409 
really emphasize the eyes have a
lengthening<00:05:33.050> mascara<00:05:33.700> but<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:34.910> volumizing

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
lengthening mascara but the volumizing

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.659 
lengthening mascara but the volumizing
one<00:05:35.720> really<00:05:36.080> thickens<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:36.800> really<00:05:37.250> gives<00:05:37.520> you

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
one really thickens and really gives you

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.510 
one really thickens and really gives you
that<00:05:37.850> fuller<00:05:38.330> lash<00:05:41.950> which<00:05:42.950> i<00:05:43.100> think<00:05:43.160> is<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.430> key

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
that fuller lash which i think is a key

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.160 
that fuller lash which i think is a key
part<00:05:44.000> of<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.210> look<00:05:44.390> like<00:05:44.570> this

under the eye so one final way that you
can<00:06:39.340> take<00:06:39.550> this<00:06:39.730> a<00:06:39.790> step<00:06:39.910> further<00:06:40.420> and<00:06:40.720> make<00:06:40.930> it

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
can take this a step further and make it

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.750 
can take this a step further and make it
maybe<00:06:41.260> into<00:06:41.560> an<00:06:41.650> evening<00:06:41.890> look<00:06:42.100> as<00:06:42.430> opposed<00:06:42.700> to

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
maybe into an evening look as opposed to

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.550 
maybe into an evening look as opposed to
a<00:06:42.850> daytime<00:06:43.240> look<00:06:43.270> like<00:06:43.570> we<00:06:43.690> have<00:06:43.870> now<00:06:44.110> is<00:06:44.380> by

a daytime look like we have now is by
adding<00:06:44.770> mascara<00:06:45.370> on<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.670> bottom<00:06:45.700> lashes<00:06:46.060> so
