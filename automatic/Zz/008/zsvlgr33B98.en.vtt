excited to try it the new 19 mil and

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.869 
excited to try it the new 19 mil and
this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:46.980> first<00:00:47.219> look<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.610> let's<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
this is my first look so let's have a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.729 
this is my first look so let's have a
look<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.030> silver<00:00:48.390> spike<00:00:54.559> never<00:00:55.559> read

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
look at silver spike never read

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:06.169 
look at silver spike never read
instructions<00:00:58.879> okay<00:01:03.469> well<00:01:04.639> first<00:01:05.639> appearance

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
instructions okay well first appearance

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:09.370 
instructions okay well first appearance
is<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.509> dramatically<00:01:07.350> different<00:01:07.409> looking<00:01:07.979> lens

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
is a dramatically different looking lens

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.690 
is a dramatically different looking lens
yeah<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.619> almost<00:01:10.740> no<00:01:10.979> similarities

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
yeah there's almost no similarities

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
yeah there's almost no similarities
between<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.209> two<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.630> new<00:01:12.749> version<00:01:12.929> is<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
between the two the new version is the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.709 
between the two the new version is the
larger<00:01:13.770> lens<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.429> that's<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
larger lens and that's because of the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.039 
larger lens and that's because of the
image<00:01:15.990> stabilizer<00:01:16.529> built<00:01:16.859> into<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:18.049> it's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
image stabilizer built into it it's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.779 
image stabilizer built into it it's
something<00:01:19.289> people<00:01:19.529> have<00:01:19.770> criticized<00:01:20.249> Tamara

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
something people have criticized Tamara

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.190 
something people have criticized Tamara
for<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.179> past<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.719> having<00:01:21.899> image

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
for the past and of having image

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.889 
for the past and of having image
stabilized<00:01:22.880> personally<00:01:23.880> has<00:01:24.389> never<00:01:24.719> been<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
stabilized personally has never been a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.559 
stabilized personally has never been a
major<00:01:25.170> problem<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.889> me<00:01:26.119> even<00:01:27.119> though<00:01:27.359> i<00:01:27.389> don't

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
major problem for me even though i don't

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.080 
major problem for me even though i don't
have<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.779> state<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.289> hands<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:29.759> it'd<00:01:29.819> be<00:01:29.909> nice

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
have the state of hands but it'd be nice

have the state of hands but it'd be nice
to<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.329> him<00:01:30.539> there<00:01:30.599> look<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.139> got<00:01:31.319> it's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
to have him there look if it's got it's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.409 
to have him there look if it's got it's
a<00:01:31.829> bonus<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.279> it<00:01:32.429> doesn't<00:01:32.789> I<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:32.909> worry<00:01:33.240> too

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:33.419 
a bonus if it doesn't I don't worry too

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.749 
a bonus if it doesn't I don't worry too
much<00:01:33.450> about<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.200> oh<00:01:34.469> so<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.459> makes<00:01:35.609> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
much about in there oh so it makes the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
much about in there oh so it makes the
lens<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.029> little<00:01:36.060> bit<00:01:36.270> larger<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.959> what<00:01:37.200> can

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
lens a little bit larger but what can

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.169 
lens a little bit larger but what can
you<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.549> old<00:01:38.729> 19<00:01:39.569> mil<00:01:39.749> used<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:41.029> port<00:01:42.029> back

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
you do the old 19 mil used to port back

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.969 
you do the old 19 mil used to port back
to<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:42.689> manual<00:01:43.020> focus<00:01:43.409> pulled

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
to get on the manual focus pulled

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.309 
to get on the manual focus pulled
forward<00:01:44.279> to<00:01:44.399> put<00:01:44.549> under<00:01:44.639> autofocus<00:01:45.450> something

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
forward to put under autofocus something

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.109 
forward to put under autofocus something
I<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.099> was<00:01:47.189> fast<00:01:47.489> in<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.849> quick

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
I like because it was fast in this quick

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.830 
I like because it was fast in this quick
and<00:01:48.149> direct<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:49.349> access<00:01:49.770> manual<00:01:50.279> focus<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and direct to access manual focus the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.870 
and direct to access manual focus the
new<00:01:51.989> version<00:01:52.429> can't<00:01:53.429> pretty<00:01:53.609> much<00:01:53.729> like

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
new version can't pretty much like

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.580 
new version can't pretty much like
everybody<00:01:54.299> else<00:01:54.539> and<00:01:54.749> just<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.319> switch

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
everybody else and just go for a switch

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
everybody else and just go for a switch
some<00:01:56.340> people<00:01:56.609> like<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> old<00:01:57.239> system<00:01:57.509> because

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
some people like the old system because

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.659 
some people like the old system because
it<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:58.049> fast<00:01:58.349> some<00:01:58.919> people<00:01:59.189> hated<00:01:59.489> it<00:01:59.579> because

00:01:59.659 --> 00:01:59.669 
it was fast some people hated it because

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:01.879 
it was fast some people hated it because
they<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.090> sometimes<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.529> they<00:02:01.619> wanted

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
they not sometimes just when they wanted

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.669 
they not sometimes just when they wanted
