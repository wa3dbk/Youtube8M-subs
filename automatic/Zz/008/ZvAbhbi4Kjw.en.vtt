00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hi, I'm silvia and they asked me if 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.790
 I do not work, I want to show you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.700
 right now in this video how it works 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.340
 in this eye I do not have anything not mate or not 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 I have a mask and in this eye I put myself 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 not twice then this 3d mask 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.539
 or the magic mask as they call it 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.449
 comes here is the gel transplant and the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.720
 fibers I'm going to get the transplant in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.149
 gel on the top is very 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.550
 important that you put in transplant in 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.600
 hell in all throughout the part of the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.700
 eye on everything on all the tabs 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 take care of all the tabs so that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.989
 glue the fibers well this is the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 glue that is going to stick the fibers 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.449
 while we put the hours and we are going to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.550
 second step of putting the fibers and putting 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.879
 also the fibers in all the part of the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 eye many people complain that they are 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.550
 fall fibers or that it can sting 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the eye the fibers then it is very 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.210
 important that after putting the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 fibers 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.020
 through the gel and the gel they just have to 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.690
 pass twice after putting on 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.030
 fibers these are the fibers and now I 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.780
 I'm going to put the gel again 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.600
 As I tell you , you are going to do it super well 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.490
 so that the fibers are not created 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.330
 what will happen is that they will have the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.970
 cheeks other fibers can 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.540
 poke in the eye and can them the can 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.090
 bother the logo then here that is the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.189
 gel I'm having a great time 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.740
 and now I 'm going to put the bottom 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.090
 in the bottom here I have nothing and 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.359
 here nothing more spread birds 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.359
 at the bottom we put ourselves once 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.939
 and we put ourselves then transplant 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.899
 gels is still more raise gel and we 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.899
 we put the fibers 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.840
 and finish again with our raise 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.840
 here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.110
 way 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.900
 there's nick I'm going to put again a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.230
 little bit more in this on this side I 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.430
 like to make long same put again 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.720
 on the tips 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.500
 only at the tips 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:56.090
 and I'm going to put the fibers remember 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 transplant in hell the natural rows and 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.950
 then again gel transplant 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.950
 and scoring again transplantation in hell 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.020
 well now in this other eye I'm going to 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.500
 put again and that's how you get a 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.600
 bit the difference dxt higher almost 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.940
 I get my eyebrow and here is not going to put 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.590
 here only at the tips 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.590
 first back raise gene 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.659
 and then the fibers 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.310
 and then you enter template and again 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.980
 I tell my clients when 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.989
 they complain that they get the fibers that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.599
 they try again putting on the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.720
 gel transplant two or three times or 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:02.739
 up to four in the whole eye covering it 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.349
 so they do not get the fibers in 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.940
 the eye here I'm going to finish that has 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.170
 painted rented for a little bit to 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.629
 to take off what happens when you 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:19.329
 hit a bit and an item and 15 pimp is a 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:22.210
 brush with the metal and canned 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:27.160
 what's going to happen here is that this one if 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.380
 sticks come to paste take off a little 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.140
 so that they are not plasmas and 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.140
 eyelashes glued with the brush 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.730
 and so the themes of your tabs here 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.020
 I have three positions since I have two and 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.740
 I'm going to match the tab minus another 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.969
 the same time the gel transplant 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.439
 First 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.439
 on the tips 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.850
 and then the fibers 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.949
 and then the transplant 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.950
 Well thank you very much for listening to me 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.950
 all that are well bye
