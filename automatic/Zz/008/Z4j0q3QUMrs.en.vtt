00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.889
 I'm pink and I'll show you today 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 the main common ramming 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.350
 members one of the most important 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.260
 Geometry data is the frame height 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.529
 frame height is given in centimeters 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.990
 mountain bikes also partially deprived 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:30.199
 The frame height is defined by and from 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:43.219
 center enters camp it's over 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:43.219
 the german house in this case 49 cm 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 some manufacturers take the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.370
 Italian from that Italian 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.699
 Mars is defined by the bottom bracket 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.270
 is a next upper important 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:06.619
 measure is the upper ranks and the upper 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 length is determined by medium 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:17.610
 ineffective upper edge on one 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 imaginary line of a horizontal to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.450
 Extension of the seat going on in this case 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 53 10 the rear construction length or chains 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 strive length is defined third camp 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.360
 middle to selection in the middle in 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.420
 our case 41 cm 410 mm 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.220
 another important factor is the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.780
 Dotter offset is defined by the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.230
 Saddle tip vertically down 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 this may not be shown and the 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:03.750
 distance from my hat to the bottom bracket 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.050
 middle of my father worth 50 line the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 next size is the control tube length 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.010
 It is simply lower edge to upper edge 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.990
 of the tax house in the case 130 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.020
 millimeter 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.090
 another important factor is the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.230
 distance the wheelbase is determined by 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:32.870
 middle failure end to front with selection 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.470
 developed in our case 106 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 centimeters the saddle height becomes 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.980
 determined from the roadway to 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.120
 to the upper edge especially in the middle of the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:58.590
 seedlings designated by what the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:05.330
 Closing point of the seat to the middle of the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.330
 handlebar in our case 67 centimeters
