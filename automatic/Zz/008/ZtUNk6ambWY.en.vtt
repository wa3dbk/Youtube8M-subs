00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.580
 Another interesting thing is also only 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.920
 You write what you want by 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.630
 example you want to find a block of 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.910
 notes you write down here under the block 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.920
 notes appear - just click 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.230
 for example you also write the 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.170
 disk-only disk defragmenter 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.230

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.860
 disk on top right 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:45.230
 and here it's just that I find it interesting too 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.240
 that the volume was horizontal 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.520
 it used to be vertical 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.360
 really below 1 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.210
 it's interesting too 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.530
 and here too he put the calendar 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.750
 more, but also the calendar now 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.020
 was much larger than windows 7 and the 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.480
 windows 8 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.360
 and here at the time you want in case 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.800
 Do you want to turn on your computer? 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.170
 stayed like this you click here 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.740
 to turn on / off is to turn it off 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:22.880
 hide how to start the attack too 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.870
 it was much easier and simple with that 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.910

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.680
