selection the two red kings are very

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.240 
selection the two red kings are very
lazy<00:00:49.750> they<00:00:49.899> don't<00:00:49.930> like<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.350> do<00:00:50.470> work<00:00:50.649> while

instantly<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:16.240> first<00:01:16.569> King<00:01:16.899> completely

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
instantly the first King completely

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.679 
instantly the first King completely
vanishes<00:01:17.979> if<00:01:18.159> I<00:01:18.249> just<00:01:18.429> snap<00:01:18.700> my<00:01:18.850> finger<00:01:19.209> with

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
vanishes if I just snap my finger with

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.139 
vanishes if I just snap my finger with
my<00:01:19.810> other<00:01:19.959> hand<00:01:20.079> the<00:01:21.039> bottom<00:01:21.459> face<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.759> King

my other hand the bottom face of King

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.099 
my other hand the bottom face of King
also<00:01:22.420> vanishes<00:01:23.249> and<00:01:24.929> where<00:01:25.929> do<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.049> think

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
also vanishes and where do you think

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.590 
also vanishes and where do you think
they<00:01:26.350> did<00:01:26.560> go<00:01:26.799> well<00:01:27.520> actually<00:01:28.209> went<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
they did go well actually went to the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.209 
they did go well actually went to the
center<00:01:28.869> of<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.109> already<00:01:29.439> and<00:01:29.679> just<00:01:29.950> simply

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
center of that already and just simply

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.519 
center of that already and just simply
thinking<00:01:30.579> it<00:01:30.700> out<00:01:30.849> see<00:01:31.599> very<00:01:31.840> efficient<00:01:32.409> they

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:32.529 
thinking it out see very efficient they

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.050 
thinking it out see very efficient they
already<00:01:32.770> narrowed<00:01:32.979> down<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.249> one<00:01:33.429> card<00:01:33.819> before

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
already narrowed down to one card before

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.230 
already narrowed down to one card before
you<00:01:34.209> even<00:01:34.389> knew<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:35.520> let's<00:01:36.520> see<00:01:36.729> if<00:01:36.939> they<00:01:37.060> did<00:01:37.209> a

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
you even knew it let's see if they did a

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.389 
you even knew it let's see if they did a
good<00:01:37.420> job<00:01:37.479> though<00:01:37.810> we<00:01:37.959> have<00:01:38.139> to<00:01:38.289> determine<00:01:39.279> if

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
good job though we have to determine if

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.039 
good job though we have to determine if
they<00:01:39.579> got<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.939> right<00:01:40.060> card<00:01:40.359> so<00:01:40.539> let's<00:01:40.569> take<00:01:41.020> a

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
they got the right card so let's take a

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.949 
they got the right card so let's take a
look<00:01:42.929> well<00:01:43.929> that's<00:01:44.139> very<00:01:44.259> strange<00:01:45.719> they<00:01:46.719> got

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
look well that's very strange they got

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.909 
look well that's very strange they got
the<00:01:47.109> two<00:01:47.409> red<00:01:47.829> King's<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:50.619> means

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:50.919 
the two red King's that's it which means

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:55.589 
the two red King's that's it which means
over<00:01:51.279> here<00:01:51.579> must<00:01:51.880> be<00:01:53.069> your<00:01:54.069> selected<00:01:54.669> six<00:01:55.179> of
