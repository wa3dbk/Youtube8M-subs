I<00:00:04.049> really<00:00:04.740> like<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.009> stability<00:00:06.109> in<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.680> end

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I really like the stability in the end

I really like the stability in the end
it<00:00:08.130> felt<00:00:08.309> like<00:00:08.519> Bend<00:00:09.179> at<00:00:09.360> speed<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.900> felt<00:00:10.110> like

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
it felt like Bend at speed it felt like

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.110 
it felt like Bend at speed it felt like
driving<00:00:10.500> more<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.010> car<00:00:11.340> didn't<00:00:11.820> feel<00:00:12.000> like

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
driving more like a car didn't feel like

was going to slip or anything you know
to<00:00:13.920> me<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.519> was<00:00:15.450> very<00:00:15.480> stuck<00:00:16.379> stuck<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
to me it was very stuck stuck in the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.910 
to me it was very stuck stuck in the
been<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.430> well<00:00:17.779> I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:20.539> acceptable

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
been very well I think it's acceptable

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.980 
been very well I think it's acceptable
we<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> peace<00:00:23.369> yes<00:00:23.640> maybe<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.960> bit

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
we like the peace yes maybe a little bit

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.230 
we like the peace yes maybe a little bit
just<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.439> over<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.890> car<00:00:29.310> over<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:29.699> here

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
just one over in your car over here here

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
just one over in your car over here here
scooter<00:00:30.990> over<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.130> has

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
scooter over here I think this one has

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.660 
scooter over here I think this one has
stronger<00:00:32.669> acceleration<00:00:33.300> gaze<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> more

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
stronger acceleration gaze is a more

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
stronger acceleration gaze is a more
same<00:00:35.670> size<00:00:35.940> motor<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.390> guess<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> lighter

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
same size motor I guess but a lighter

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.950 
same size motor I guess but a lighter
bike<00:00:37.680> all<00:00:37.890> around<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:39.360> hasn't<00:00:39.600> got<00:00:39.870> these

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bike all around that it hasn't got these

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
bike all around that it hasn't got these
new<00:00:40.200> technologies<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> instrumentation

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
new technologies but the instrumentation

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
different but I really like how it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
different but I really like how it
sticks<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> bends<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:20.850> does

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sticks in the bends in it it really does

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
sticks in the bends in it it really does
a<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.600> job<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:23.640> quite<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.150> power

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
a good job there but not quite the power

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.070 
a good job there but not quite the power
that<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.869> need

that we need

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.039 
that we need
now<00:01:25.470> 150<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.909> been<00:01:27.090> serviced<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.930> be

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
now 150 would have been serviced to be

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.020 
now 150 would have been serviced to be
better<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> think

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
better I think

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.540 
better I think

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
but the FI I think means it is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.570 
but the FI I think means it is
fuel-injected<00:01:32.210> yes<00:01:33.020> at<00:01:33.500> one<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.950> five<00:01:34.250> but

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.990 

so<00:03:21.590> we<00:03:21.739> can<00:03:21.890> agree<00:03:22.099> about<00:03:22.280> one<00:03:22.550> thing<00:03:22.760> about

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
so we can agree about one thing about

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.850 
so we can agree about one thing about
this<00:03:23.150> bike<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.599> that<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.080> wow<00:03:24.230> factor

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
this bike and that is the wow factor

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.460 
this bike and that is the wow factor
we<00:03:25.340> were<00:03:26.090> having<00:03:26.390> people<00:03:26.540> stop<00:03:27.050> us<00:03:27.230> on<00:03:27.379> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
we were having people stop us on the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.220 
we were having people stop us on the
street<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.010> say<00:03:28.790> what<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.390> thing

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
street and say what is that thing

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.460 
street and say what is that thing
it<00:03:30.440> was<00:03:30.620> stopping<00:03:31.010> point<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:31.580> Easter<00:03:32.470> yeah

holding capacity in Avengers beautiful
it<00:03:46.910> really<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.239> not<00:03:47.480> really<00:03:47.720> really<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.290> stable

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
it really is not really really is stable

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.800 
it really is not really really is stable
really<00:03:49.280> feels<00:03:49.549> very<00:03:49.819> safe<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.390> doesn't<00:03:50.420> though

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
really feels very safe it doesn't though

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.650 
really feels very safe it doesn't though
it's<00:03:50.959> going<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.200> slip<00:03:51.440> out<00:03:51.680> on<00:03:52.099> gravel<00:03:52.660> it

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
it's going to slip out on gravel it

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.009 
it's going to slip out on gravel it
really<00:03:53.959> really<00:03:54.410> rides<00:03:54.650> very<00:03:54.920> well<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:56.019> think

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
really really rides very well I think

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
really really rides very well I think
they'll<00:03:57.230> probably<00:03:57.380> come<00:03:57.680> out<00:03:57.799> with<00:03:57.920> 150

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
they'll probably come out with 150

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.910 
they'll probably come out with 150
version<00:03:59.180> maybe<00:03:59.720> in<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.019> year<00:04:00.140> or<00:04:00.380> two<00:04:00.470> just

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
version maybe in a year or two just

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.500 
version maybe in a year or two just
because<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.400> think<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.819> needs<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.180> little<00:04:02.269> more

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
because I think it needs a little more

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.990 
because I think it needs a little more
power<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:03.980> low<00:04:04.220> Yamaha<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:04.970> a

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
power and like a low Yamaha it's a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.630 
power and like a low Yamaha it's a
little<00:04:05.269> bit<00:04:05.420> noisy<00:04:05.630> compared<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.680> latest

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
fitting through the traffic like we saw

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.450 
fitting through the traffic like we saw
the<00:05:02.900> other<00:05:03.139> videos<00:05:03.590> someone<00:05:04.099> caught<00:05:04.310> up

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
the other videos someone caught up

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.510 
the other videos someone caught up
back-to-back<00:05:04.940> one<00:05:05.479> foot<00:05:05.750> up<00:05:05.870> one<00:05:06.800> it's<00:05:07.400> a

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
back-to-back one foot up one it's a

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.339 
back-to-back one foot up one it's a
little<00:05:07.669> bit<00:05:07.910> wide<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.330> get<00:05:08.450> between<00:05:08.810> cars<00:05:09.110> I

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
little bit wide to get between cars I

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.159 
little bit wide to get between cars I
think<00:05:10.060> maybe<00:05:11.060> not<00:05:11.300> in<00:05:11.479> America<00:05:11.990> or<00:05:12.050> Australia

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
think maybe not in America or Australia

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.310 
think maybe not in America or Australia
but<00:05:12.800> certainly<00:05:13.250> in<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:14.060> hospital<00:05:14.780> took<00:05:15.139> it

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
but certainly in the hospital took it

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.520 
but certainly in the hospital took it
temp<00:05:15.590> yeah<00:05:16.520> where<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.510> lanes<00:05:17.900> are<00:05:18.169> so<00:05:18.380> much

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
temp yeah where the lanes are so much

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.370 
temp yeah where the lanes are so much
smaller<00:05:19.240> but<00:05:20.240> all<00:05:20.360> round<00:05:20.570> I<00:05:20.690> think<00:05:20.750> it's<00:05:20.990> got

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
smaller but all round I think it's got

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.140 
smaller but all round I think it's got
an<00:05:21.500> issue

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
an issue
