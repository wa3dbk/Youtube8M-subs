00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.700
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.509
 This theme is 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.600
 Here is a plastic ball 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.780
 What is the foremost chop block that shows power 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.650
 I would like to introduce it to everyone, but it is a technology to be introduced this time 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.470
 In fact, most players do at the time of cell ball 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.980
 It was not in the cell ball 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.590
 It was a difficult technology but I used it so much 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 If it becomes that plastic ball despite the technology that was not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.079
 The number of players who use the technology has increased dramatically 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:50.859
 It is a block to chop in the fore 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.089
 It is called a block that rotates back and forth 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.899
 If you do it in a cell, you will overmistake it 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.190
 If it is a plastic ball, the opponent's rotation is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.239
 The force of the ball which is weakening a little is also falling 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.000
 In a situation like saying 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.939
 It became easy to hold on the table, so even looking at world championships etc. 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.799
 Because it is a technology that is gradually increasing players to use 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.939
 In the sense of pre-emptive as a technique of the measure of plastic ball 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.439
 I think that I want to introduce it to everyone 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.250
 The player who will do this way until now 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.179
 There was almost nothing, so by doing this first 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.390
 It's like the other party makes an amazing surprise 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.590
 The first feature is that you can play 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.869
 Another characteristic is the strong change 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.880
 If you enter honestly because it is a very strong block of rotation 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.600
 It is very difficult to take the other party 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.700
 Because it is difficult, I want to go directly to the point in the block 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.399
 For those who want to aim at a point in a block with a change 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.240
 It will be the recommended technique. 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 I would like to introduce in three steps 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.270
 The first step is the hitting point The hitting point is 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.520
 Please try to bounce and get up 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.810
 Chop block is the name of the name but 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 Because I cut it like chopping 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.540
 I'll switch from the top to the power coming up 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.270
 It's an image like that I've passed the vertex 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.240
 If it says that it will be pushed from the top to the falling ball again 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.520
 It is difficult to match well 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.260
 By cutting up and going up 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.530
 Because it is the movement of the form that passes each other 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.660
 First of all, you can hit the ball 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.360
 From the moment you fall down 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:03:00.900
 Please try it with an image like aiming 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.110
 Next is the second point The second point is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.960
 It is a racket racket from the tip 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.420
 Please put in with the gun 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.170
 If you use your wrist here, it looks like it will break 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.080
 Impact moment by using the wrist 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.130
 It is easy to blur 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.060
 It will become less stable 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.580
 There is a danger, so here 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.760
 Gun from the center in a straightened condition 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.450
 Rub the ball stably by putting it in 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.260
 I will be able to say I'm going to rub 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.630
 So when you do this technology 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.820
 Probability when entering from the tip 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.870
 I think that stability is up 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.960
 The third step is next to the ball 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.570
 Please take the side of the ball 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.190
 If you take a head-on, you get a spin 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.940
 Because I think that I will make an outrageous mistake 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.090
 I take the side of this ball and shift the axis a little 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.730
 It is an image, such as horizontal bottom rotation 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.150
 Take a sideways in the image and freely 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.050
 By turning off the ball axis with the image of cutting 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.130
 It becomes easier to chop and hold 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.850
 So take a side of the ball 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.240
 Please be aware of 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.870
 That's three points this time 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.220
 Hitting point is about to go up and the racket 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.780
 Insert from the tip Insert from the tip 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.970
 These three points that aim at the side of the ball with 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.900
 It is quite chop by having you be conscious 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 Because it becomes easy to hold the ball while turning it back 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.250
 Please be aware of those three points 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.970
 Thank you for trying it
