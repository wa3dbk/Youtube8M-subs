00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.650
 Today I introduce you the mod wild 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.840
 horses for carroll 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.410
 You can join the team as normal 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.269
 Download or subscribe to the workshop 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.949
 and I'll write the link to you then 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.939
 the video description is published 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.880
 this mod was from Ashley 99 and has 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 Also over 5000 ratings and total 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.180
 five stars 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 a collection of this wild 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:42.629
 we find here straying fares 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 For example, near swindlers is one 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.440
 but the good animals must first 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.129
 start because shy and first 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.129
 before a change 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 were caught only once so remote yes 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 which is not that hard 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.330
 At that time can quickly behind men can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.330
 you can ride it without problems 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.300
 But then you decide the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 travel on foot and descend 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.890
 the horse rides back two small ones 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.220
 However, the disadvantages are once the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 whole names of the distant English and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 Do you want to start a new game then 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 you will soon realize that I am in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.370
 the initial sequence the horses all 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.070
 collect against a stone wall in one 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.960
 bake rock and do not thrive that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 That player will never be in the village 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920
 helmers at the cost and get in there 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 character transcripts and it ran 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.410
 actually install my tip first 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.550
 if you already have a character and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.680
 maybe heroes left behind 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.950
 has thereafter , it should be no problems 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950
 go
