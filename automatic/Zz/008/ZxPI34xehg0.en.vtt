00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
they connected to the material we were

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.810 
they connected to the material we were
proposing<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.939> them<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:25.550> some<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.670> them

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
proposing to them that some of them

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.710 
proposing to them that some of them
extreme<00:00:28.189> other<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.369> average<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.599> all

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
extreme other in average but it's all

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
extreme other in average but it's all
good<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.109> all<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:32.009> came<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
good it's all right what came out of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.950 
good it's all right what came out of
URIs<00:00:33.530> mind<00:00:34.530> no<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.790> mind<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.630> it's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
URIs mind no not in my mind I think it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
URIs mind no not in my mind I think it's
pretty<00:00:37.200> much<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.500> group<00:00:37.950> work<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:39.030> always

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
pretty much a group work and we always

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.100 
pretty much a group work and we always
wanted<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.250> as<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> group<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:42.300> always<00:00:42.570> wanted<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
wanted to as a group we always wanted to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.400 
wanted to as a group we always wanted to
play<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.530> theatrical<00:00:44.160> codes<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:46.079> start

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
play with theatrical codes and we start

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
play with theatrical codes and we start
with<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> idea<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.700> would<00:00:47.850> happen<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
with the idea what would happen if you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.970 
with the idea what would happen if you
put<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> audience<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.649> chair<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
put the audience in a chair that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
put the audience in a chair that
actually<00:00:50.520> moves<00:00:50.820> instead<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> fixed<00:00:52.020> chair

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
actually moves instead of a fixed chair

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.819 
actually moves instead of a fixed chair
from<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.360> watch<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.899> stage<00:00:55.230> from

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
from which you just watch a stage from

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
from which you just watch a stage from
far<00:00:56.370> away<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.149> really<00:00:57.390> wanted<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> immerse

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
far away you really wanted to immerse

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430 
far away you really wanted to immerse
the<00:00:59.280> audience<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> performance<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the audience into the performance and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.910 
the audience into the performance and
which<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.789> happens<00:01:03.920> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
which is pretty much what happens and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.210 
which is pretty much what happens and
then<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> came<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.590> play<00:01:07.890> was

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
then it came about that the play was

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.940 
then it came about that the play was
about<00:01:08.330> trust<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.810> how<00:01:10.290> much<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.070> engage

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
about trust and how much do you engage

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.450 
about trust and how much do you engage
into<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.880> comes

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
into something if it comes

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.950 
into something if it comes
very<00:01:15.760> close<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:19.180> best<00:01:19.420> way<00:01:19.659> to<00:01:19.690> do

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
very close to you and the best way to do

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.980 
very close to you and the best way to do
that<00:01:20.170> actually<00:01:20.470> was<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.940> blindfold<00:01:22.570> people

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
that actually was to to blindfold people

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.609 
that actually was to to blindfold people
to<00:01:23.229> take<00:01:23.770> part<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.550> their<00:01:24.729> control<00:01:25.150> away<00:01:25.630> by

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
to take part of their control away by

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.330 
to take part of their control away by
moving<00:01:27.310> them<00:01:27.580> around<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.770> really<00:01:30.100> works

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
moving them around and it really works

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
moving them around and it really works
on<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.759> imagination<00:01:31.659> it<00:01:32.259> really<00:01:32.560> works<00:01:32.860> on

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
on the imagination it really works on

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.499 
on the imagination it really works on
self-reflection<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:36.509> confrontation

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
self-reflection and and confrontation

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.790 
self-reflection and and confrontation
with<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:38.259> boundaries<00:01:38.800> area<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:41.500> what

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
with your boundaries area so that's what

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.770 
with your boundaries area so that's what
we<00:01:41.920> explored<00:01:42.460> pretty<00:01:42.909> much<00:01:43.180> because<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.630> took

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
we explored pretty much because it took

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.320 
we explored pretty much because it took
quite<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.259> while<00:01:44.350> before<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:45.009> came<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.340> the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
quite a while before we came to the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.169 
quite a while before we came to the
final<00:01:46.930> version<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.590> show<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:49.000> was

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
final version of a show and that was

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.450 
final version of a show and that was
really<00:01:49.360> connected<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.020> trying<00:01:50.860> things<00:01:51.220> out

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
really connected to trying things out

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.740 
really connected to trying things out
and<00:01:52.860> listening<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.130> reaction

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.470 

so<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.950> was<00:01:58.190> for<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.520> long<00:01:58.640> time<00:01:59.000> working

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
so it was for a long time working

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.170 
so it was for a long time working
progress<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.610> course<00:02:01.820> yeah<00:02:02.000> we

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
progress and of course yeah we

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.620 
progress and of course yeah we
push-button<00:02:02.690> them<00:02:03.220> we<00:02:04.220> generate<00:02:05.030> some<00:02:05.330> some

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
push-button them we generate some some

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.050 
push-button them we generate some some
feelings<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.010> try<00:02:07.220> always<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.550> do<00:02:07.820> that

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
feelings but we try always to do that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.999 
feelings but we try always to do that
and<00:02:08.180> that's<00:02:08.300> why<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.009> decomposing

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
and that's why we have this decomposing

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.950 
and that's why we have this decomposing
space<00:02:10.340> that's<00:02:11.180> why<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.720> little

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
space that's why you have this little

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.210 
space that's why you have this little
conversation<00:02:12.170> at<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.740> end<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.040> show

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
conversation at the end of the show

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.400 
conversation at the end of the show
again<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.030> then<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.960> have<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> guestbook

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
again and then you have the guestbook

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.560 
again and then you have the guestbook
where<00:02:15.710> they<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:16.070> write<00:02:16.640> down<00:02:16.850> something<00:02:17.210> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
where they can write down something and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.660 
where they can write down something and
