00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
does help when it comes to making

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.220 
does help when it comes to making
montage<00:06:08.400> comes<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.480> making<00:06:09.750> wish<00:06:09.870> intimate

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
montage comes to making wish intimate

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.860 
montage comes to making wish intimate
everything<00:06:10.730> getting<00:06:11.730> camera<00:06:12.240> angles<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:12.780> all
