00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.100 
other hand there's some people that get
in<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> big<00:01:28.770> moment<00:01:29.689> where<00:01:30.689> they've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
in that big moment where they've got a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
in that big moment where they've got a
score<00:01:31.409> points<00:01:31.650> top<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> neutral

whatever<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> they've<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
whatever it is they've got to take a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.249 
whatever it is they've got to take a
chance<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.490> look<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.270> as<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
chance and they look at that is as if I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.609 
chance and they look at that is as if I
attack<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> better<00:01:39.000> chance<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.360> score

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
attack I have a better chance to score

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
attack I have a better chance to score
if<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.740> score<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.159> points<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> better

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
if I score more points I have a better

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.219 
if I score more points I have a better
chance<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
chance of

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.640 
chance of
when<00:01:45.229> again<00:01:45.590> feel<00:01:45.860> good<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.820> shooting<00:01:47.600> goes<00:01:48.470> to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
when again feel good so shooting goes to

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.060 
when again feel good so shooting goes to
win<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.040> when<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.880> goes<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.060> feeling<00:01:50.540> good

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
we took steps out there but that's the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.390
