00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.670
 of the arenal sound and pincho yo and then 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.490
 I think about my friends from time later 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 so all those who are going to launch 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.680

 they throw with many friends we had 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.930
 have a video of the experience of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.940
 of things in my instagram lucas improvements 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.819
 in instagram it is worth and then just on day 3 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.819
 I 'm back from the almazÃ¡n and I'm leaving with 2 days 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.920
 enjoying my family that always goes 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.989
 make movement but we also comment 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.780
 one thing is worth telling us to explain very 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.530
 well but manage to focus the issue of 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.390
 advertising 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.400
 Many people have just understood that it is 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.500
 the work of a blogger of a youtuber 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.940
 or from an instagram the voucher there are many 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.970
 I 'm going to talk to you 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.070
 and I know that I am 100% really all that 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.200
 it was always taught is they are things that I use 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.030
 be within a campaign or not by 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.620
 example kat kit i love tica not me 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.840
 I like chocolate I like little 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.370
 things and the kat kit is one of the things 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.780
 that I like then if I start a 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.820
 campaign that is cat obviously I'm going to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.530
 accept because I'm teaching something that 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.120
 I really like something that I like 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.190
 for example the cacaolat I can not 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.830
 live without talking you know obviously me 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.870
 write of many brands and I say that 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.910
 not me, if I do not like it, I'm not going to take it out 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.060
 I mean, I never sell, I never sell 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.550
 me because I'm not like that and for you 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.560
 because I like to show you so much in fashion 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.480
 of consumption of all the things that 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.880
 I really like that I can help you 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.020
 recommend this dress well 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.220
 I'll talk to you I love it 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.420
 if I do not like it as much as I 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.980
 give away or as much as a campaign 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.960
 I'm not going to put it, I'm not going to 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.140
 teach know it's my job I 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.000
 to win in life but that what 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.460
 I do with the things that really 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.870
 they really like I said millions of 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.290
 Sometimes not to a lot of money 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.250
 but because it does not go with me 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.769
 the things that I like all and another 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.510
 theme write a lot of girls 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.450
 asking for advice and also telling me 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.099
 what I have helped you or what I dislike 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.890
 you are with yourself or with your 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.680
 body or with x and I want to tell you that 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.090
 that can not be that there is a stereotype 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.329
 marked that unfortunately is a woman 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.459
 so very very very thin without boobs to me 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.410
 I really like the Canary Islands, the plan 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.329
 but you know why but all good 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.520
 the world that I already said once 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.289
 you all have what you want as 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.699
 you are and what we care and what they will say 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.740
 you also write me a lot saying month 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.050
 yeah clear I put on a hat but I 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.240
 I live in a village they tell me such or 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.610
 which does not matter if you want to be a 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.740
 hat and you like the hat and the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.020
 another tells you they give age I do not know that this 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.900
 animal towards my friends you like not 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.729
 Well, he wants you and that's it and all 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.099
 we have complexes but we have to 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.740

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.000

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:03.050

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:23.959
