looking attractive enhancing the value
of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> house<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:25.680> something<00:00:26.039> happens<00:00:26.400> that

there's one thing I've learned and you
can<00:00:56.789> already<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.930> previous

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can already see from a previous

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.369 
can already see from a previous
application<00:00:59.100> where<00:00:59.309> when<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> made<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> direct

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
application where when I made a direct

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.680 
application where when I made a direct
application<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> scratch<00:01:02.039> right<00:01:02.340> here

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
application on the scratch right here

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.740 
application on the scratch right here
you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:05.119> scratch<00:01:06.119> actually<00:01:06.600> got

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
you can see the scratch actually got

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
you can see the scratch actually got
darker<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.220> reason<00:01:08.360> what<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
darker so for that reason what I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
darker so for that reason what I
encourage<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> I

encourage you to do is the way that I
recommend<00:01:11.880> which<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> rag<00:01:13.290> or

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
recommend which is to take a rag or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.300 
recommend which is to take a rag or
paper<00:01:13.830> towel<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.350> take<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> stain<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
paper towel and you take the stain and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
paper towel and you take the stain and
work<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.950> rag<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.290> get<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
work it into the rag like this get a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.310 
work it into the rag like this get a
little<00:01:22.380> build<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.420> then<00:01:24.420> very<00:01:24.720> slowly<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
little build up and then very slowly and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.410 
little build up and then very slowly and
methodically<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> start<00:01:26.490> rubbing<00:01:27.240> over

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
methodically you just start rubbing over

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.249 
methodically you just start rubbing over
some<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> scratches<00:01:29.780> what<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.960> allows

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
some of the scratches what this allows

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
some of the scratches what this allows
you<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.070> you're<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.520> controlling<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you to do is you're now controlling the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
you to do is you're now controlling the
amount<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.079> stain<00:01:34.500> getting<00:01:35.009> down<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
amount of stain getting down in that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
amount of stain getting down in that
scratch<00:01:38.479> you'll<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.340> reapply<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
scratch you'll have to reapply more to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
scratch you'll have to reapply more to
the<00:01:44.299> paper<00:01:45.299> towel<00:01:45.740> or<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.329> rag<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.490> but

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the paper towel or the rag like this but

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
the paper towel or the rag like this but
again<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.720> safer<00:01:51.990> way

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
again I think this is a much safer way

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770 
again I think this is a much safer way
than<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.579> take<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> applicator<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
than to just take the applicator and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.959 
than to just take the applicator and
make<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> direct<00:01:55.680> application<00:01:56.549> which<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> what

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
make a direct application which is what

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
make a direct application which is what
I<00:01:57.000> did<00:01:57.210> over<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> I'll<00:01:57.840> duplicate<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
I did over here and I'll duplicate it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.440 
I did over here and I'll duplicate it
again<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.159> you'll<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.670> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
again just so you'll see the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.970 
again just so you'll see the
consequences

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.669 

again<00:02:06.980> this<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:08.060> where<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.270> stain<00:02:09.200> going<00:02:09.530> in

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
again this is where the stain going in

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.490 
again this is where the stain going in
the<00:02:09.830> rag<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.630> we're<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:11.810> going<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.960> work<00:02:12.200> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the rag and we're just going to work a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.050 
the rag and we're just going to work a
number<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.070> these<00:02:13.220> scratches<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:16.490> it's<00:02:16.850> much

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
number of these scratches and it's much

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.060 
number of these scratches and it's much
easier<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> get<00:02:17.750> them<00:02:17.960> blend<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.890> see

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
easier to get them blend in you see

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.190 
easier to get them blend in you see
right<00:02:22.280> there<00:02:22.310> what<00:02:22.730> happened<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.330> much<00:02:24.170> more

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
right there what happened I much more

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.130 
right there what happened I much more
you<00:02:24.680> actually<00:02:24.860> took<00:02:25.250> what<00:02:25.820> was<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.360> scratch

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
you actually took what was a scratch

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.160 
you actually took what was a scratch
that<00:02:27.680> was<00:02:28.280> lighter<00:02:28.580> than<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.000> wood<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:29.900> it's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
that was lighter than the wood now it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.170 
that was lighter than the wood now it's
darker<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.340> want<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.610> be<00:02:31.700> careful<00:02:32.150> that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
darker so you want to be careful that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.150 
darker so you want to be careful that
you<00:02:32.420> don't<00:02:32.630> create<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.560> problem<00:02:33.800> and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
you don't create more of a problem and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.180 
you don't create more of a problem and
your<00:02:34.610> attempts<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.000> try<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.890> deal<00:02:36.890> with<00:02:37.100> the

your attempts to try and deal with the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.860 
your attempts to try and deal with the
problem<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.550> you've<00:02:37.760> got<00:02:38.830> now<00:02:39.910> as<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.480> said

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
problem that you've got now as I said

with<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.770> floors<00:02:58.100> then<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.120> would<00:02:59.270> followed

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
with the floors then we would followed

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.800 
with the floors then we would followed
this<00:02:59.870> with<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.440> recode<00:03:00.920> if<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.270> in<00:03:02.390> an<00:03:02.480> area

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
this with a recode if this is in an area

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.440 
this with a recode if this is in an area
that<00:03:02.870> gets<00:03:03.170> very<00:03:03.290> little<00:03:03.910> traffic<00:03:04.910> such<00:03:05.300> as<00:03:05.420> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
that gets very little traffic such as a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.500 
that gets very little traffic such as a
bedroom<00:03:05.930> or<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.550> study<00:03:07.550> or<00:03:07.940> something<00:03:08.300> that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
bedroom or a study or something that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.240 
bedroom or a study or something that
where<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> activity<00:03:09.230> level<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.739> much<00:03:09.950> less

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
where the activity level is much less

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.160 
where the activity level is much less
and<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.090> think<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:11.570> see<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:11.989> is

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
and I think you can see that this is

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.220 
and I think you can see that this is
probably<00:03:12.590> going<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.830> suffice<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.110> let's<00:03:15.110> go

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
probably going to suffice so let's go

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.160 
probably going to suffice so let's go
over<00:03:15.470> what<00:03:15.620> we've<00:03:15.769> learned<00:03:16.010> first<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.000> all<00:03:17.170> you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
over what we've learned first of all you

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.440 
over what we've learned first of all you
want<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.440> get<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> stain<00:03:19.130> marker<00:03:20.030> touch-up

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450

want to get a stain marker touch-up
marker<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:23.030> want<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.570> paper

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
marker and you want to use the paper

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.890

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
down coatings over this I strongly

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.770 
down coatings over this I strongly
recommend<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:44.090> get<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.330> touch<00:03:44.570> with<00:03:44.600> a

professional who knows how to work with

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.670 
professional who knows how to work with
the<00:03:47.150> coatings<00:03:47.510> don't<00:03:47.810> go<00:03:48.049> out<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.470> start

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
the coatings don't go out and start

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.080 
the coatings don't go out and start
fooling<00:03:49.040> around<00:03:49.310> with<00:03:49.459> these<00:03:49.549> coatings<00:03:49.940> on

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
fooling around with these coatings on

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.030 
fooling around with these coatings on
your<00:03:50.269> own<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:51.110> could<00:03:51.260> take<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> bad<00:03:51.769> situation

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
your own you could take a bad situation

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.590 
your own you could take a bad situation
and<00:03:52.700> make<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.120> worse

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
and make it worse

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.750 
and make it worse
so<00:03:54.470> again<00:03:54.829> stain<00:03:55.760> marker<00:03:56.180> rag<00:03:56.660> gloves<00:03:57.610> work<00:03:58.610> it

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
so again stain marker rag gloves work it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.620 
so again stain marker rag gloves work it
in<00:03:59.019> take<00:04:00.019> your<00:04:00.170> time<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:01.940> think<00:04:02.390> that'll

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
in take your time and I think that'll

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.970 
in take your time and I think that'll
solve<00:04:02.870> most<00:04:03.079> of<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.290> problems<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.709> you've

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
solve most of the problems that you've

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.509 
solve most of the problems that you've
got<00:04:04.360> with<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.450> wood<00:04:05.600> floors<00:04:05.840> anyway<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:07.160> again

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
got with the wood floors anyway so again

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.400 
got with the wood floors anyway so again
