for the car what about a Toyota Corolla

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
for the car what about a Toyota Corolla
which<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.250> best<00:00:44.460> error<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.450> times<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
which is the best error of all times and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
which is the best error of all times and
it<00:00:46.440> looks<00:00:46.680> roughly<00:00:47.130> it<00:00:47.250> exists<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.930> for<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it looks roughly it exists and for the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.220 
it looks roughly it exists and for the
plane<00:00:49.230> let's<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.460> Boeing<00:00:50.760> 737<00:00:51.329> the

most popular plane in commercial

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.330 
most popular plane in commercial
aviation<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.950> looks<00:00:56.160> like

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
aviation and here is what it looks like

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
aviation and here is what it looks like
all<00:00:57.239> right<00:00:57.600> let's<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.170> through<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> numbers

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
all right let's go through the numbers

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.270 
all right let's go through the numbers
how<00:00:59.550> much<00:00:59.789> fuel<00:01:00.090> does<00:01:00.360> each<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.840> them<00:01:01.020> burn<00:01:01.350> on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
how much fuel does each of them burn on

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
how much fuel does each of them burn on
a<00:01:02.340> highway<00:01:02.940> at<00:01:03.149> 60<00:01:03.539> MPH<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.320> Corolla<00:01:04.979> burns

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
a highway at 60 MPH a Corolla burns

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.660 
a highway at 60 MPH a Corolla burns
roughly<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.299> point<00:01:06.570> eight<00:01:06.750> gallons<00:01:06.990> per<00:01:07.350> hour

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
roughly one point eight gallons per hour

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
roughly one point eight gallons per hour
okay<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.729> how<00:01:09.090> much<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.570> point<00:01:09.930> eight<00:01:10.110> guns

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
okay so how much is one point eight guns

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.399 
okay so how much is one point eight guns
per<00:01:10.500> hour<00:01:10.710> exactly<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:12.390> help<00:01:12.659> us<00:01:12.840> compare<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
per hour exactly to help us compare the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
per hour exactly to help us compare the
few<00:01:13.619> floats<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.040> built<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.729> experiment<00:01:15.360> with

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
few floats I built this experiment with

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
few floats I built this experiment with
colored<00:01:15.930> water<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:17.040> left-hand<00:01:17.520> side<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.970> for

1.8 gallons per hour wow this is a very
thin<00:01:24.600> stream<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.049> fuel<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.189> fact<00:01:26.430> that's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
thin stream of fuel but in fact that's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.570 
thin stream of fuel but in fact that's

holy<00:01:47.009> cow<00:01:47.400> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.810> fuel<00:01:49.579> actually

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
holy cow this is a lot of fuel actually

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.530 
holy cow this is a lot of fuel actually
it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.150> 400<00:01:51.780> times<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.259> than<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.770> car<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.540> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it is 400 times more than the car in the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.080 
it is 400 times more than the car in the
experiment<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.560> hose<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.790> big

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
experiment the hose was not even big

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.899 
experiment the hose was not even big
enough<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.600> accommodate<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.229> fuel<00:01:58.500> flow<00:01:58.909> what

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
enough to accommodate the fuel flow what

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
enough to accommodate the fuel flow what
you<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> fuel<00:02:01.320> flow<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.710> only

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you see here is the fuel flow of only

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.730 
you see here is the fuel flow of only
one<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> engines<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.079> since<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> plane

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
one of the engines but since the plane

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.089 
one of the engines but since the plane
has<00:02:05.009> two<00:02:05.340> engines<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:07.049> what<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> fuel

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
has two engines this is what the fuel

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.339 
has two engines this is what the fuel
flow<00:02:08.279> of<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.639> plane<00:02:08.909> in<00:02:09.179> cruise<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:10.109> looks

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
flow of the plane in cruise really looks

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.440 
flow of the plane in cruise really looks
like<00:02:10.619> pretty<00:02:11.489> impressive<00:02:12.319> so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
like pretty impressive so

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300 
like pretty impressive so
looks<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.080> plane<00:02:14.349> burns<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.980> lot<00:02:15.129> more

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
looks like the plane burns a lot more

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.750 
looks like the plane burns a lot more
fuel<00:02:15.700> than<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.090> car<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.860> comparison<00:02:18.430> is

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
fuel than the car but this comparison is

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.000 
fuel than the car but this comparison is
not<00:02:19.060> really<00:02:19.390> fair<00:02:19.690> since<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> plane<00:02:20.769> also

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
not really fair since the plane also

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.430 
not really fair since the plane also
carries<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.519> lot<00:02:21.730> more<00:02:21.940> passengers<00:02:22.569> as<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
carries a lot more passengers as a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.710 
carries a lot more passengers as a
matter<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:23.860> fact<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.670> US<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.629> average

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
matter of fact in the US the average

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.930 
matter of fact in the US the average
number<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.260> passengers<00:02:26.769> in<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.220> car<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.640> only

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
number of passengers in a car is only

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.520 
number of passengers in a car is only
1.6<00:02:28.930> where<00:02:29.800> has<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.430> Boeing<00:02:30.819> 737<00:02:31.390> carries<00:02:32.260> in

1.6 where has a Boeing 737 carries in

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.809 
1.6 where has a Boeing 737 carries in
average<00:02:33.300> 144<00:02:34.300> passengers<00:02:35.220> therefore<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
average 144 passengers therefore the

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.850 
average 144 passengers therefore the
comparison<00:02:37.420> would<00:02:37.599> be<00:02:37.660> more<00:02:37.959> fair<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.470> we

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
comparison would be more fair if we

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.620 
comparison would be more fair if we
consider<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> fuel<00:02:39.790> flow<00:02:39.940> per<00:02:40.299> passenger

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
consider the fuel flow per passenger

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.589 
consider the fuel flow per passenger
instead<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.819> quantity<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.299> fuel

closer the numbers are now this is what
it<00:03:15.760> looks<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.630> experiment<00:03:17.170> these

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
it looks like in the experiment these

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.890 
it looks like in the experiment these
are<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.519> fuel<00:03:18.760> flows<00:03:19.060> divided<00:03:19.660> by<00:03:19.840> the

with<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.130> plane<00:03:27.370> still<00:03:27.700> appears<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.299> first

year<00:03:28.900> than<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.230> car<00:03:30.480> however<00:03:31.480> we'll<00:03:32.230> still

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
year than the car however we'll still

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.890 
year than the car however we'll still
missing<00:03:32.769> something<00:03:33.069> in<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.519> comparison<00:03:33.910> the

minute<00:03:58.030> now<00:03:59.019> let's<00:03:59.680> have<00:03:59.829> a<00:03:59.889> look<00:04:00.130> at<00:04:00.220> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
minute now let's have a look at the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.009 
minute now let's have a look at the

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.690 
plane needs with our experiment the fuel
flows<00:04:05.290> are<00:04:05.530> exactly<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.130> same<00:04:06.160> than<00:04:06.549> before

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.180 
flows are exactly the same than before
but<00:04:07.480> now<00:04:07.690> we're<00:04:07.989> going<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.290> collect<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.920> fuel

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
but now we're going to collect the fuel

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.039 
but now we're going to collect the fuel
for<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.549> amount<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.880> time<00:04:09.940> needed<00:04:10.150> by<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.720> car

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
for the amount of time needed by the car
