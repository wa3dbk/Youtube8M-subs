00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.870
 the ksv hessen kassel is about to 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.210
 rise play in the third football 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.580
 Bundesliga on Wednesday meet the lions 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.620
 away at the match on holstein kiel 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 we spoke shortly before the departure of the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 Team with coach Uwe Wolf 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.900
 Mr Wolf, your co-coach has said one 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.890
 notices that something big is like 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.859
 you feel something like that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.230
 we have a huge anticipation 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.509
 already the first promotion game in 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.249
 keel around it glad that one 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.640
 euphoria has arisen here in the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.040
 city 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.050
 you have told me times than me 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.100
 the north hessen are come here 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.720
 rather pessimistic 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.490
 and that is also the merit of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.230
 team the euphoria that arose 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.810
 is the merit of the team for the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.310
 work they have done and that 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.350
 water is just reached during the session 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.130
 have and just the qualification for the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.190
 rose games 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.470
 I would have marked her kiel 1 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.060
 Offensive very much on his quality 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.750
 only the four offensive players 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 johannsen haider schikora together 50 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.910
 scoring goals that is already a word 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.429
 but we also want accordingly 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.469
 on our defensive duties 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.689
 and that's always good for us 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.810
 succeeded and there we see yours 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.700
 There is a chance in the backlash 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.229
 Desired outcome for the game of chance I 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.640
 my decision is yes one 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.290
 back and forth play 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.820
 football is not a wish concert but if 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 I would wish for something I would 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 say if you make a goal if you do 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.000
 shoot and get none 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.300
 that would of course be paramount it would be 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.940
 optimal but of course that is the first time 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.370
 90 minutes of work in Kiel because 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.360
 already addressed with the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.830
 OffensivqualitÃ¤t there will certainly any 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.370
 a lot of work is coming to us in the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.010
 defensive network but that is assuming and 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.509
 we are looking forward to it 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.460
 last question christian henel that was yes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.360
 last struck how is there 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910
 state of things 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 we just have to wait and see 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.240
 because who's in the morning 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.080
 training unit did not have 100 percent 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.390
 can join 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.250
 so we have to wait and see how it is now 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 the treatment is now also striking 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.090
 this afternoon or evening but me 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.090
 assume he can play
