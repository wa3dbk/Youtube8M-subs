Molly style wedding that runs down that

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.469 
Molly style wedding that runs down that
and<00:01:04.220> I'll<00:01:04.339> show<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.759> reason<00:01:04.879> for<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.180> in

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
and I'll show you the reason for that in

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.670 
and I'll show you the reason for that in
a<00:01:05.630> little<00:01:05.840> bit<00:01:05.960> in<00:01:06.860> profile<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:08.570> f4<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.140> g4

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
a little bit in profile the f4 the g4

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.770 
a little bit in profile the f4 the g4
fill<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.399> same<00:01:10.579> volume<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.090> both<00:01:11.240> packs<00:01:11.630> at

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
fill the same volume so both packs at

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.660 
fill the same volume so both packs at
this<00:01:11.930> point<00:01:12.170> are<00:01:12.290> about<00:01:12.439> a<00:01:12.469> 5,000<00:01:13.159> cubic<00:01:13.340> inch

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
this point are about a 5,000 cubic inch

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.880 
this point are about a 5,000 cubic inch
pack<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.600> difference<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.409> operator

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
pack the difference is that the operator

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.730 
pack the difference is that the operator
has<00:01:16.549> a<00:01:16.579> portion<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.299> its<00:01:17.450> volume<00:01:17.930> consumed<00:01:18.590> by

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
has a portion of its volume consumed by

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740 
has a portion of its volume consumed by
the<00:01:18.799> weapons<00:01:19.220> carrier<00:01:19.610> where<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.360> Terminator

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
the weapons carrier where the Terminator

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.270 
the weapons carrier where the Terminator
does<00:01:20.960> not<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:21.650> as<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.860> basic<00:01:22.479> load-bearing

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
does not so as a basic load-bearing

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.730 
does not so as a basic load-bearing
volume<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.790> f4<00:01:26.540> Terminator<00:01:26.990> has<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.260> bit<00:01:27.500> more

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
volume that f4 Terminator has a bit more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.180 
volume that f4 Terminator has a bit more
than<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.400> g4<00:01:28.729> operator<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.990> g4s<00:01:30.440> volume<00:01:31.100> is

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
than the g4 operator the g4s volume is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.620 
than the g4 operator the g4s volume is
consumed<00:01:31.549> by<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.700> weapon<00:01:32.030> scabbard<00:01:32.390> which<00:01:32.479> is

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
consumed by the weapon scabbard which is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.539 
consumed by the weapon scabbard which is
basically<00:01:33.020> just<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.320> big<00:01:33.500> pocket<00:01:33.799> if<00:01:34.400> you're

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
basically just a big pocket if you're

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:35.890 
basically just a big pocket if you're
carrying<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.880> weapon<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.240> consumes<00:01:35.659> some<00:01:35.780> of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
carrying a weapon that consumes some of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.899 
carrying a weapon that consumes some of
the<00:01:35.960> space<00:01:36.200> if<00:01:36.530> not<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.159> big<00:01:37.400> pocket<00:01:37.640> for

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
the space if not it's a big pocket for

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:49.300 
the space if not it's a big pocket for
other<00:01:38.060> things<00:01:38.150> such<00:01:38.540> as<00:01:38.570> prick<00:01:39.140> 117<00:01:39.770> radios

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.250 

the<00:01:50.310> Terminator<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.360> similar<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> our<00:01:51.930> g4

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
the Terminator is very similar to our g4

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.950 
the Terminator is very similar to our g4
operator<00:01:52.710> pack<00:01:53.010> but<00:01:53.550> there<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:53.970> many<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.840> our

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
operator pack but there are many of our

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.390 
operator pack but there are many of our
customers<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:55.440> were<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.950> snipers<00:01:56.370> that

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
customers that were not snipers that

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.450 
customers that were not snipers that
didn't<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> built<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.510> rifle<00:01:57.870> scabbard

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
didn't want the built in rifle scabbard

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.070 
didn't want the built in rifle scabbard
we<00:01:59.460> still<00:01:59.670> made<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.910> pack<00:02:00.150> capable<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
we still made this pack capable of

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.360 
we still made this pack capable of
carrying<00:02:01.290> weapons<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.040> did<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.250> in

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
carrying weapons we just did it in

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.250 
carrying weapons we just did it in
different<00:02:02.580> way<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.480> other<00:02:03.630> reason<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
different way the other reason for that

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.910 
different way the other reason for that
r21<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:06.840> basic<00:02:07.410> load<00:02:07.620> bearing

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
r21 is we have more basic load bearing

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.530 
r21 is we have more basic load bearing
capacity<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.580> pack<00:02:08.790> so<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.270> you're<00:02:09.420> not

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
capacity in the pack so if you're not

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.670 
capacity in the pack so if you're not
carrying<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> weapon<00:02:09.990> in<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.260> pack<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.649> have

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
carrying a weapon in the pack you have

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.790 
carrying a weapon in the pack you have
more<00:02:10.950> basic<00:02:11.700> volume<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.210> gear<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
more basic volume for your gear on the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.230 
more basic volume for your gear on the
other<00:02:13.920> hand<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.310> want<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.580> carry<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.820> pack<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
other hand if you want to carry a pack a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.420 
other hand if you want to carry a pack a
rifle<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.930> pack<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.280> more

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
pocket it has a pullout rain cover so we

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.140 
pocket it has a pullout rain cover so we
can<00:05:10.990> cover<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.320> entire<00:05:11.620> pack<00:05:12.150> slightly

can cover the entire pack slightly

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.550 
can cover the entire pack slightly
different<00:05:13.479> color<00:05:13.630> than<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.870> pack<00:05:14.080> so<00:05:14.349> if<00:05:14.470> you

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
different color than the pack so if you

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.230 
different color than the pack so if you
need<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.740> darker<00:05:15.159> cover<00:05:15.460> for<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.789> pack<00:05:16.000> then

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
need a darker cover for the pack then

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.219 
need a darker cover for the pack then
you<00:05:16.330> can<00:05:16.479> use<00:05:16.659> the<00:05:16.870> rain<00:05:17.590> cover<00:05:18.960> as<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.050> said

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
you can use the rain cover as I said

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:21.600 
you can use the rain cover as I said
earlier<00:05:20.590> you<00:05:21.070> wouldn't<00:05:21.250> know<00:05:21.460> at<00:05:21.580> first
