action<00:02:39.890> release<00:02:40.250> slide<00:02:40.970> over<00:02:41.210> here<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.930> sticks

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
action release slide over here it sticks

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.150 
action release slide over here it sticks
out<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> lot<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.370> way<00:02:43.490> I<00:02:43.720> hold<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.160> with

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
have my thumb on it so the slide is not

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.870 
have my thumb on it so the slide is not
locked<00:02:51.080> back<00:02:51.350> at<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:52.160> end<00:02:52.340> after<00:02:52.550> all<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
action Plus which is a big feature of

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.240 
action Plus which is a big feature of
this<00:02:58.880> pistol<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.960> for<00:03:00.590> those<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.890> who<00:03:00.920> don't

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
this pistol so for those you who don't

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.340 
this pistol so for those you who don't
know<00:03:01.310> double<00:03:02.120> action<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.930> standard

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
know double action is the standard

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.200 
know double action is the standard
action<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:04.250> happens<00:03:04.610> when<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.850> pull<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
action that happens when you pull the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.640 
action that happens when you pull the
hammer<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.630> goes<00:03:05.750> back<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.230> then<00:03:06.290> forward

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
hammer it goes back and then forward

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.190 
hammer it goes back and then forward
it's<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.980> full<00:03:07.310> trigger<00:03:07.940> draw

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
it's the full trigger draw

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.350 
it's the full trigger draw
single<00:03:09.770> action<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.280> when<00:03:10.460> it's<00:03:10.580> back<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
single action is when it's back and the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.970 
single action is when it's back and the
trigger<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.930> just<00:03:12.200> releases<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.740> so<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
trigger it just releases it so the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.620 
trigger it just releases it so the
trigger<00:03:13.250> pullers<00:03:13.520> are<00:03:13.670> usually<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> lot<00:03:14.360> less

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
trigger pullers are usually a lot less

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.280 
trigger pullers are usually a lot less
so<00:03:15.440> what<00:03:16.010> they<00:03:16.220> did<00:03:16.280> with<00:03:16.880> Lionheart<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.600> they

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so what they did with Lionheart is they

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.620 
so what they did with Lionheart is they
literally<00:03:18.709> made<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.520> so<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:20.300> can<00:03:20.450> have

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
literally made it so that you can have

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.290 
literally made it so that you can have
the<00:03:20.750> hammer<00:03:20.959> all<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> way<00:03:21.410> forward<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.010> it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
the hammer all the way forward and it

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.360 
the hammer all the way forward and it
very<00:03:23.300> very<00:03:23.959> barely<00:03:24.470> any<00:03:24.650> trigger<00:03:24.920> pull<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
very very barely any trigger pull to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.370 
very very barely any trigger pull to
bring<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.730> back<00:03:25.940> into<00:03:26.390> single<00:03:26.840> action<00:03:27.200> and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
bring it back into single action and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.630 
bring it back into single action and
then<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> single<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:31.250> put<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.520> back

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
then it's just a single you put it back

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.140 
then it's just a single you put it back
in<00:03:31.820> place<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.330> just<00:03:32.620> think<00:03:33.620> but<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.970> what

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
in place and just think but the it what

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.210 
in place and just think but the it what
it<00:03:35.270> does<00:03:35.510> is<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.230> really<00:03:36.440> does<00:03:36.770> make<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.190> so

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it does is it really does make it so

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.690 
it does is it really does make it so
that<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.750> trigger<00:03:39.410> pull<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.709> only<00:03:40.100> about<00:03:40.310> four

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
that the trigger pull is only about four

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.120 
that the trigger pull is only about four
four<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.270> half<00:03:41.330> pounds<00:03:41.840> versus<00:03:42.650> normally

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
four and a half pounds versus normally

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.520 
four and a half pounds versus normally
on<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> double<00:03:43.580> action<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.970> would<00:03:44.030> probably<00:03:44.209> be

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
on a double action it would probably be

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.479 
on a double action it would probably be
somewhere<00:03:45.530> in<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> six<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.040> eight<00:03:46.220> range

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
somewhere in the six to eight range

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.970 
somewhere in the six to eight range
because<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.239> long<00:03:47.570> draw<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.590> anytime

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
because it is a long draw and anytime

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.440 
because it is a long draw and anytime
you<00:03:49.220> have<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.370> long<00:03:49.430> draw<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.300> your

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
you have a long draw like that your

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.729 
you have a long draw like that your
hands<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.930> shake<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.170> little<00:03:51.350> bit<00:03:51.560> because

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
hands in a shake a little bit because

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.060 
hands in a shake a little bit because
your<00:03:51.980> muscle<00:03:52.250> tension<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:57.230> something<00:03:57.770> else<00:03:57.890> I

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
your muscle tension so something else I
