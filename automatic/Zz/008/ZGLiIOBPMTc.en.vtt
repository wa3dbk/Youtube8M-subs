00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
smoothly along it but you people use it

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.090 
smoothly along it but you people use it
as<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.299> highway<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.200> don't<00:04:04.410> use<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.739> just<00:04:04.920> as<00:04:05.040> a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
as a highway and don't use it just as a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.880 
as a highway and don't use it just as a
