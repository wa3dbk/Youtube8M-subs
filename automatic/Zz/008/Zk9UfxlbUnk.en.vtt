00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to show

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.760> measure<00:00:03.030> for<00:00:03.179> carpet<00:00:03.750> now

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
you how to measure for carpet now

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.260 
you how to measure for carpet now
there's<00:00:04.950> two<00:00:05.160> type<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.430> things<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:06.000> get

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
there's two type of things that we get

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.589 
there's two type of things that we get
into<00:00:06.629> when<00:00:07.080> we're<00:00:07.259> measuring<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.950> carpet

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
into when we're measuring for carpet

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.430 
into when we're measuring for carpet
that<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.530> case<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.440> standard

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
that is in this case we have a standard

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.700 
that is in this case we have a standard
carpet<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.240> wall-to-wall<00:00:15.870> type<00:00:16.529> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
carpet that is a wall-to-wall type of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.490 
carpet that is a wall-to-wall type of
carpet<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.060> case<00:00:18.390> we're<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.439> to

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
carpet so in this case we're going to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.189 
carpet so in this case we're going to
measure<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.340> width<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.420> we'll<00:00:21.720> look<00:00:21.869> at<00:00:22.020> this

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
measure the width and we'll look at this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.830 
measure the width and we'll look at this
landing<00:00:22.680> area<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.390> measure<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
landing area and if I measure this

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.820 
landing area and if I measure this
landing<00:00:25.320> area<00:00:26.720> I'm<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> measure<00:00:28.199> from

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
landing area I'm going to measure from

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.980 
landing area I'm going to measure from
the<00:00:29.220> base<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.640> stair<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.330> baseboard

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the base of the stair to this baseboard

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.910 
the base of the stair to this baseboard
and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.160> 40<00:00:32.610> inches<00:00:33.260> now<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.770> what

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and I get 40 inches now actually what

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
and I get 40 inches now actually what
we're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.030> install<00:00:36.570> our

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
we're going to do when we install our

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.410 
we're going to do when we install our
carpet<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.469> I'll<00:00:38.250> show<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.090> spare

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
carpet and I'll show you on this spare

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.250 
carpet and I'll show you on this spare
piece<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:42.540> actually<00:00:42.780> are<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
piece is that we actually are going to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.110 
piece is that we actually are going to
fold<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:44.040> inch<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:46.789> this<00:00:47.789> carpet<00:00:48.120> over<00:00:49.969> when<00:00:50.969> we

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
fold an inch of this carpet over when we

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.540 
fold an inch of this carpet over when we
install<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
install it so as you can see that on the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
install it so as you can see that on the
profile<00:00:54.059> that's<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.340> installs

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
profile that's actually how it installs

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.349 
profile that's actually how it installs
with<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.420> inch<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.989> rolled<00:00:58.379> over<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
with an inch of that rolled over and

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.119 
with an inch of that rolled over and
then<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.570> goes<00:01:00.809> into<00:01:00.840> your<00:01:01.260> poles<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
then that goes into your poles or is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
then that goes into your poles or is
stapled<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.420> makes<00:01:03.690> sure<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
stapled in and that makes sure we have a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.859 
stapled in and that makes sure we have a
nice<00:01:04.530> finished<00:01:05.010> edge<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.489> our<00:01:05.519> carpet<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.659> with

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
nice finished edge on our carpet so with

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.260 
nice finished edge on our carpet so with
that<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.260> mind<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> measured<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.820> width

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that in mind when I measured that width

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440 
that in mind when I measured that width
I<00:01:09.510> need<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> add<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.619> inches<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.090> wit<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
I need to add two inches to the wit to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.380 
I need to add two inches to the wit to
the<00:01:12.920> measurement<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.939> actual

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the measurement and that's the actual

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929 
the measurement and that's the actual
width<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> carpet<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.680> need<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
width of the carpet that I need to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.960 
width of the carpet that I need to
carpet<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.509> area<00:01:19.130> now<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> second<00:01:20.700> instance

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
carpet this area now the second instance

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.320 
carpet this area now the second instance
we<00:01:21.180> run<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.920> when<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.400> wood<00:01:23.939> stairs

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
we run to is when we have wood stairs

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.630 
we run to is when we have wood stairs
that<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:25.020> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> run<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> carpet<00:01:26.070> runner<00:01:26.280> down

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that we want to run a carpet runner down

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.039 
that we want to run a carpet runner down
and<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.020> case<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> measure

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
and in that case I'm going to measure

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.490 
and in that case I'm going to measure
the<00:01:31.049> tread<00:01:31.409> length<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.810> my<00:01:33.810> carpet<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the tread length of my carpet in this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.700 
the tread length of my carpet in this
case<00:01:34.710> they're<00:01:34.950> 45<00:01:35.369> inches<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.320> want<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
case they're 45 inches so if I want a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
case they're 45 inches so if I want a
runner<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.490> leaves<00:01:39.390> me<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:39.720> least<00:01:39.990> three

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
runner that leaves me at least three

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
runner that leaves me at least three
inches<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.860> each<00:01:41.070> side<00:01:41.540> I'm<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> take

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
inches on each side I'm going to take

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
inches on each side I'm going to take
off<00:01:43.439> six<00:01:44.100> inches<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.180> width<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
off six inches for the width of the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.590 
off six inches for the width of the
carpet<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:46.860> runner<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.180> thirty

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
carpet so that my runner will be thirty

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.319 
carpet so that my runner will be thirty
nine<00:01:48.869> inches<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.490> very<00:01:50.640> important<00:01:51.210> if

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
nine inches so it's very important if

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.850 
nine inches so it's very important if
you're<00:01:51.479> doing<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.810> wall-to-wall<00:01:52.079> type<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you're doing a wall-to-wall type of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.179 
you're doing a wall-to-wall type of
carpet<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.880> want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> add<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:54.990> inches<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
carpet you want to add two inches on to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.639 
carpet you want to add two inches on to
the<00:01:56.340> dimension<00:01:56.899> so<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.140> how<00:01:58.320> wide<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the dimension so you know how wide a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.649 
the dimension so you know how wide a
piece<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> cut<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.579> order<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.969> install<00:02:00.270> because

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
piece to cut in order to install because

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.209 
piece to cut in order to install because
you're<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> roll<00:02:01.350> those<00:02:01.500> edges<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.070> or

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you're going to roll those edges in or

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.429 
you're going to roll those edges in or
if<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.820> runner<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.719> actually<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.320> to
