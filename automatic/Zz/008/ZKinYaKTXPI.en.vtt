able to use for a utility sink well this
is<00:00:27.449> something<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.930> found<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.890> garage

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
is something I found in my garage

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.770 
is something I found in my garage
it<00:00:29.849> had<00:00:30.090> bricks<00:00:30.510> sitting<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.349> top<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.780> I

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it had bricks sitting on top of it and I

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.520 
it had bricks sitting on top of it and I
just<00:00:33.989> measured<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.420> exactly<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
just measured it and it's exactly the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.119 
just measured it and it's exactly the
same<00:00:38.100> size<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.329> need<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.800> actually

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
same size that we need and it actually

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
same size that we need and it actually
does<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.790> sink<00:00:42.239> top<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.260> have

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
does have a sink top to it which I have

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
does have a sink top to it which I have
already<00:00:43.920> taken<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:45.180> sink<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.079> right

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
already taken off the sink top is right

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
already taken off the sink top is right
here<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.730> needs<00:00:47.940> quite<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
here you can see it needs quite a bit of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
here you can see it needs quite a bit of
TLC<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> feeling<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
TLC and I got a feeling it's going to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810 
TLC and I got a feeling it's going to
need<00:00:50.640> resurfacing<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.610> there's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
need resurfacing but I know that there's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
need resurfacing but I know that there's
some<00:00:54.390> companies<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.899> even<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.350> self

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
some companies and even some self

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.610 
some companies and even some self
resurfacing<00:00:56.879> kits<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.570> might<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.440> able<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
resurfacing kits that might be able to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220 
resurfacing kits that might be able to
work<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.420> but<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.079> right

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
work on that but as you can see right

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
work on that but as you can see right
now<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> need<00:01:03.120> some<00:01:03.359> TLC<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
now this is going to need some TLC the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.490 
now this is going to need some TLC the
feet<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.830> completely<00:01:05.339> rusted<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.500> some

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we'll see if this works

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.830 
we'll see if this works
so<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.880> took<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.299> drawers

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so as you can see it took some drawers

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.969 
so as you can see it took some drawers

green<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.650> crummy

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
green but it's really really crummy

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.749 
green but it's really really crummy
paint<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:40.110> washed<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
paint because as I washed you can see

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
paint because as I washed you can see
some<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> green<00:01:42.420> paint<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:43.020> came

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
some of the green paint actually came

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.550 
some of the green paint actually came
off<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.720> sure<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> have

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
off so I'm not sure if I'm going to have

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
off so I'm not sure if I'm going to have
to<00:01:46.770> try<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.100> wipe<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.270> paint<00:01:48.720> off<00:01:49.850> or<00:01:50.850> if

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to try and wipe all that paint off or if

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.370

I'll<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> able<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.659> paint<00:01:51.869> over<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I'll be able to paint over it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
I'll be able to paint over it
but<00:01:53.540> we'll<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.750> happens<00:01:55.520> well<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:57.380> I've

to get in the corners I'm using a small
wire<00:02:18.540> brush<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.579> for<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:20.700> area<00:02:21.030> over<00:02:21.150> here
