00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
there's the display to the hydrogen is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
there's the display to the hydrogen is
the<00:00:37.860> adjuster<00:00:38.370> mass<00:00:39.330> airflow<00:00:41.570> there's<00:00:42.570> an

the adjuster mass airflow there's an

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.390 
the adjuster mass airflow there's an
ultra<00:00:42.960> gauge<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:44.640> fits<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:47.160> very

ultra gauge this fits on there it's very

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.890 
ultra gauge this fits on there it's very
nice<00:00:49.550> what<00:00:50.550> sort<00:00:50.790> of<00:00:50.820> expectations<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.810> you

got<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.290> system<00:00:54.620> well<00:00:55.620> I'll<00:00:56.040> be<00:00:56.280> happy

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
got for the system well I'll be happy

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.760 
got for the system well I'll be happy
with<00:00:56.730> 10<00:00:56.970> miles<00:00:57.180> per<00:00:57.390> gallon<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.230> hoping

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
with 10 miles per gallon but I'm hoping

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.820 
with 10 miles per gallon but I'm hoping
to<00:00:59.040> double<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.610> mpg<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.900> think<00:01:01.080> 10<00:01:01.620> miles

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
to double my mpg now I think 10 miles

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.110 
to double my mpg now I think 10 miles
per<00:01:01.980> gallon<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.580> good<00:01:02.790> because<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
per gallon is pretty good because this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.010 
per gallon is pretty good because this
car<00:01:03.420> should<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.809> 50<00:01:08.570> don't<00:01:09.570> want<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
car should do 50 don't want it to do a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.090 
car should do 50 don't want it to do a
hundred<00:01:10.260> yeah<00:01:11.420> it's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.630> big<00:01:13.590> car<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
hundred yeah it's a big car to you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
disappointed if it doesn't do a hundred

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.440 
disappointed if it doesn't do a hundred
oh<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.900> wanted<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> record<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.800> unrealistic

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
oh but I wanted a record of unrealistic

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
oh but I wanted a record of unrealistic
expectations<00:01:23.210> yes<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.440> is<00:01:25.619> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
expectations yes because this is this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this is an unrealistic expectation what

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.270 
this is an unrealistic expectation what
is<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.660> does<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.810> mean<00:01:32.030> all<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:34.280> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
is it what does it mean all right and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.359 
is it what does it mean all right and
and<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.000> 1.1<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.860> under

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and this is a 1.1 what is it I under

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.870 
and this is a 1.1 what is it I under
let's<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.660> which<00:01:40.289> is<00:01:40.319> also<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.860> keeper<00:01:41.340> contour

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
let's get which is also a keeper contour

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.669 
let's get which is also a keeper contour
which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> also<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.550> summer<00:01:44.550> else<00:01:49.910> yeah

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
which is also a summer else yeah

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.320 
which is also a summer else yeah
basically<00:01:52.679> every<00:01:53.250> car<00:01:53.460> manufacturer<00:01:53.970> sells

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
basically every car manufacturer sells

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.080 
basically every car manufacturer sells
this<00:01:55.229> same<00:01:55.560> car<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> different<00:01:56.640> budgets

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this same car with the different budgets

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.290 
this same car with the different budgets
so<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.319> get<00:01:58.800> good<00:01:58.830> results<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.789> we<00:01:59.819> should

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
so if we get good results then we should

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.370 
so if we get good results then we should
have<00:02:00.420> lots<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.640> customers<00:02:06.140> what<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> want

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
have lots of customers what do you want

to know what we're doing John we're

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.110 
to know what we're doing John we're
gonna<00:02:11.069> test<00:02:11.340> drive<00:02:12.319> all<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.500> his<00:02:13.620> famous<00:02:14.120> sell

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
gonna test drive all of his famous sell

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.949 
gonna test drive all of his famous sell
and<00:02:18.230> math<00:02:19.230> sensor

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
and math sensor

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.539 
and math sensor
yeah<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.989> well<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.019> said<00:02:24.680> earlier<00:02:25.040> 10<00:02:25.340> miles

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
yeah and well I said earlier 10 miles

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.099 
yeah and well I said earlier 10 miles
per<00:02:25.760> gallon<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.239> really<00:02:26.689> did<00:02:26.870> say

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
per gallon but I really did say

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.309 
per gallon but I really did say
yesterday<00:02:27.620> 100<00:02:28.150> because<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.329> way<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.930> was

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
yesterday 100 because on the way I was

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.009 
yesterday 100 because on the way I was
doing<00:02:30.349> 50<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.609> motorways<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.659> wasn't<00:02:32.930> very

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
doing 50 on the motorways it wasn't very

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.949 
doing 50 on the motorways it wasn't very
good<00:02:33.109> weather<00:02:33.439> but<00:02:33.799> his<00:02:33.980> headwind<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.930> when<00:02:35.930> I

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
good weather but his headwind and when I

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.379 
good weather but his headwind and when I
got<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:36.409> it<00:02:36.560> was<00:02:36.590> 49<00:02:37.340> miles<00:02:37.790> per<00:02:38.030> gallon

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
got here it was 49 miles per gallon

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:43.690 
got here it was 49 miles per gallon
average<00:02:40.659> so<00:02:41.659> I<00:02:42.019> mean<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.219> doubled<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.670> I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
average so I mean you doubled that I

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.289 
average so I mean you doubled that I
would<00:02:44.060> think<00:02:44.239> you've<00:02:44.540> done<00:02:45.379> a<00:02:45.409> good<00:02:45.560> job

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
would think you've done a good job

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.349 
would think you've done a good job

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.950 

they're<00:03:39.610> in<00:03:39.880> tank<00:03:40.150> temperature<00:03:40.570> now<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
they're in tank temperature now the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.890 
they're in tank temperature now the
strange<00:03:41.260> thing<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.740> is<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.940> considerably

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
strange thing is is that is considerably

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.430 
strange thing is is that is considerably
warmer<00:03:44.170> than<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.070> air<00:03:45.160> intake<00:03:45.670> temperature

warmer than the air intake temperature
this<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.070> with<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.340> master<00:03:48.670> Chester<00:03:49.090> unfold

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
this is with the master Chester unfold

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.080 
this is with the master Chester unfold
if<00:03:49.840> we<00:03:50.080> have<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.320> most<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.860> run<00:03:51.130> not<00:03:51.400> fall

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
if we have the most just run not fall

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.449 
if we have the most just run not fall
it<00:03:52.360> doesn't<00:03:52.690> like<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.350> amazing

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.820 

yeah<00:03:59.459> small<00:04:00.120> but<00:04:00.840> he's<00:04:00.959> doing<00:04:01.170> nearly<00:04:01.530> hundred

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
yeah small but he's doing nearly hundred

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.860 
yeah small but he's doing nearly hundred
miles<00:04:02.190> per<00:04:02.370> gallon<00:04:02.700> we<00:04:03.270> were<00:04:03.390> doing<00:04:03.599> around

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
miles per gallon we were doing around

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.750 
miles per gallon we were doing around
town

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.690 

yeah

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
yeah

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.850 
yeah
what's<00:04:09.270> interesting<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.900> because<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.560> thinks

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
what's interesting is because it thinks

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.100 
what's interesting is because it thinks
it's<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.220> war<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:12.180> he<00:04:12.270> thinks<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.720> vacuum

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
it's to war and he thinks the vacuum

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.039 
it's to war and he thinks the vacuum
really<00:04:13.410> high<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:14.640> won't<00:04:14.910> light<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.480> engine<00:04:15.870> to

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
really high it won't light the engine to

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.530 
really high it won't light the engine to
go<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.410> full<00:04:16.620> load<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:18.060> doesn't<00:04:18.359> matter

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
go on to full load so it doesn't matter

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.640 
go on to full load so it doesn't matter
how<00:04:18.980> annoyingly<00:04:20.180> clumsy<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.510> erratic<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
how annoyingly clumsy of erratic the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.430 
how annoyingly clumsy of erratic the
drivers<00:04:23.100> for<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:24.300> John<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.229> could

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
drivers for so John if you could

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.980 
drivers for so John if you could
demonstrate<00:04:25.590> by<00:04:26.660> accelerating<00:04:27.660> and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
demonstrate by accelerating and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.589 
demonstrate by accelerating and
decelerating

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.909 

David<00:04:31.259> I<00:04:31.409> was

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.800 

I'm<00:04:34.249> assuming<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.909> I<00:04:35.030> grab<00:04:35.330> because<00:04:35.509> he's

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
I'm assuming and I grab because he's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.110 
I'm assuming and I grab because he's
accelerating<00:04:36.199> decelerating<00:04:37.039> order<00:04:37.969> he

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
accelerating decelerating order he

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.700 
accelerating decelerating order he
change<00:04:38.449> gear<00:04:39.430> that's<00:04:40.430> different

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
change gear that's different

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.870 
change gear that's different
it's<00:04:42.889> well<00:04:43.040> connect<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.430> miles-per-gallon

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
it's well connect the miles-per-gallon

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.570 
it's well connect the miles-per-gallon
based<00:04:44.330> on<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.630> games<00:04:44.889> yeah

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.350 

yeah

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.240 

in<00:04:54.449> currency<00:04:54.960> we<00:04:55.139> did<00:04:55.349> 50<00:04:56.310> miles<00:04:56.490> an<00:04:56.669> hour

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.909

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:17.470 

I<00:05:04.949> don't<00:05:05.580> want<00:05:05.759> the<00:05:05.849> accelerant

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.870

and the mouse becoming close oh so

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.669 
and the mouse becoming close oh so
you're<00:05:44.060> in<00:05:44.150> hard<00:05:44.360> acceleration

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:50.679 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:54.159
