things going on in one of our workshops
and<00:00:19.900> it's<00:00:20.900> getting<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.260> bit<00:00:21.410> nippy<00:00:21.560> we're<00:00:22.130> in

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
and it's getting a bit nippy we're in

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.279 
and it's getting a bit nippy we're in
the<00:00:22.250> middle<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.460> winter<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.030> I'm<00:00:23.900> just<00:00:24.170> going

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
the middle of winter and I'm just going

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.620 
the middle of winter and I'm just going

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
sent it to us two or three days ago

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.440 
sent it to us two or three days ago
we've<00:00:39.800> been<00:00:39.950> using<00:00:40.130> it<00:00:40.340> ever<00:00:40.460> since<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.940> as

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
we've been using it ever since and as

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.760 
we've been using it ever since and as
soon<00:00:41.600> as<00:00:41.690> we<00:00:41.810> turn<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.140> on<00:00:42.200> whereas<00:00:42.470> warmers

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
soon as we turn it on whereas warmers

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.110 
soon as we turn it on whereas warmers
types<00:00:42.980> come<00:00:43.190> on<00:00:43.280> I'll<00:00:43.370> tell<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:43.670> how<00:00:43.790> it<00:00:43.910> works

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.070 

and<00:00:47.120> it's<00:00:48.110> phenomenal<00:00:49.540> very<00:00:50.540> very<00:00:50.900> clever

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
and it's phenomenal very very clever

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.040 
and it's phenomenal very very clever
heater<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.830> you<00:00:51.860> can<00:00:52.550> see<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:53.570> first<00:00:53.840> thing

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
heater and you can see the first thing

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.830 
heater and you can see the first thing
that<00:00:54.200> I'll<00:00:54.320> point<00:00:54.590> out<00:00:54.860> here<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.630> that<00:00:56.630> there's

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
that I'll point out here is that there's

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.270 
that I'll point out here is that there's
a<00:00:56.930> thermostat<00:00:58.360> connection<00:00:59.360> box<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.980> in<00:01:00.980> order

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
a thermostat connection box and in order

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.530 
a thermostat connection box and in order
to<00:01:01.400> connect<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> thermostat<00:01:02.270> which<00:01:02.390> we'll

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
to connect the thermostat which we'll

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.329 
to connect the thermostat which we'll
talk<00:01:02.690> about<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.170> moment<00:01:03.290> there's<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.129> little

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
talk about in a moment there's a little

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.789 
talk about in a moment there's a little
cap<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.820> end<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.420> cat<00:01:05.630> comes<00:01:05.990> out<00:01:06.350> of

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
cap in the end so the cat comes out of

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.300 
cap in the end so the cat comes out of
there<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:07.250> as<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.970> can<00:01:08.119> see<00:01:08.360> from<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.750> lights

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
there and as you can see from the lights

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.830 
there and as you can see from the lights
when<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.430> cap<00:01:10.670> goes<00:01:10.909> in<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.299> completes<00:01:11.690> the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
when the cap goes in it completes the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.420 
when the cap goes in it completes the
circuit<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.650> heat<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:12.980> can<00:01:13.040> be<00:01:13.190> used

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
circuit so the heat it can be used

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.250 
circuit so the heat it can be used
without<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.790> thermostat<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.050> cap

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
without the thermostat but the cap

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.200 
without the thermostat but the cap
always<00:01:15.560> needs<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.550> we'll<00:01:17.030> leave

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
always needs to be in so we'll leave

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.760 
always needs to be in so we'll leave
that<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.570> for<00:01:17.780> now<00:01:17.870> while<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.260> demonstrate

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
that in for now while we demonstrate

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.400 
that in for now while we demonstrate
what's<00:01:18.980> going<00:01:19.250> on<00:01:19.570> it's<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.720> direct<00:01:21.170> heater

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
what's going on it's a direct heater

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.430 
what's going on it's a direct heater
it's<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.980> diesel<00:01:22.190> heater<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.750> before<00:01:24.260> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
it's a diesel heater and before the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.770 
it's a diesel heater and before the
diesel<00:01:24.830> gets<00:01:25.040> anywhere<00:01:25.670> near<00:01:25.730> these<00:01:26.330> two

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
diesel gets anywhere near these two

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.420 
diesel gets anywhere near these two
really<00:01:27.620> powerful<00:01:29.230> combustion<00:01:30.230> chambers<00:01:30.710> it's

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
really powerful combustion chambers it's

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.570 
really powerful combustion chambers it's
filtered<00:01:32.060> twice<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.620> filtered<00:01:34.100> as<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.430> goes

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
filtered twice it's filtered as it goes

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.570 
filtered twice it's filtered as it goes
into<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.150> tank<00:01:35.420> there's<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.930> filter<00:01:36.430> as<00:01:37.430> you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
into the tank there's a filter as you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.490 
into the tank there's a filter as you
put<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.850> diesel<00:01:38.150> II<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.570> then<00:01:39.020> as<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.470> comes

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
put the diesel II and then as it comes

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.649 
put the diesel II and then as it comes
into<00:01:40.250> each<00:01:40.430> chamber<00:01:41.000> there's<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.270> separate

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
into each chamber there's a separate

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.320 
into each chamber there's a separate
filter<00:01:42.110> which<00:01:42.680> filters<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.220> diesel<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:43.760> it's

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
filter which filters the diesel so it's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.780 
filter which filters the diesel so it's
pure<00:01:44.659> diesel<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.260> goes<00:01:45.409> into<00:01:45.650> here<00:01:45.979> being<00:01:46.610> a

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
pure diesel that goes into here being a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.480 
pure diesel that goes into here being a
direct<00:01:49.120> heater<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:51.140> air<00:01:51.860> pressure<00:01:52.190> from

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
direct heater the air pressure from

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.670 
direct heater the air pressure from
behind<00:01:52.850> causes<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.479> negative<00:01:53.720> pressure<00:01:54.320> inside

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
behind causes a negative pressure inside

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280 
behind causes a negative pressure inside
which<00:01:55.490> sucks<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.060> diesel<00:01:56.510> into<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
which sucks the diesel into the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.180 
which sucks the diesel into the
combustion<00:01:57.620> chamber<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.430> as<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.960> combusts<00:02:00.620> it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
combustion chamber and as it combusts it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.800 
combustion chamber and as it combusts it
blows<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.700> he's<00:02:01.850> head<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.210> front<00:02:02.540> so

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
blows that he's head of the front so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.480 
blows that he's head of the front so
it's<00:02:02.960> quite<00:02:03.290> important<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:03.979> fact<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:04.280> very

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
it's quite important in fact it's very

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.609 
it's quite important in fact it's very
important<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.600> some<00:02:05.840> ventilation<00:02:06.170> when

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
important to have some ventilation when

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.830 
important to have some ventilation when
you're<00:02:06.740> using<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.190> type<00:02:07.430> of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
you're using this type of

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
Peter we've got doors and windows and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.930 
Peter we've got doors and windows and
roof<00:02:10.840> vents<00:02:11.110> all<00:02:11.319> over<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.650> place<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.160> we're

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
roof vents all over the place so we're

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.220 
roof vents all over the place so we're
quite<00:02:13.180> safe<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.629> here<00:02:13.750> but<00:02:13.930> that's<00:02:14.019> an

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
quite safe in here but that's an

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.720 
quite safe in here but that's an
important<00:02:14.590> point<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.860> remember<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.400> do<00:02:15.550> this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
important point to remember you do this

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.030 
important point to remember you do this
and<00:02:15.940> ventilation<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.200> an<00:02:17.470> incredibly

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and ventilation but an incredibly

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.020 
and ventilation but an incredibly
powerful<00:02:18.280> heat<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.239> see<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.890> each

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
powerful heat so you can see that each

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.979 
powerful heat so you can see that each
combustion<00:02:22.030> chamber<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.690> will<00:02:22.810> work

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
combustion chamber that will work

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.490 
combustion chamber that will work
independently<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.549> can<00:02:24.700> fire<00:02:24.940> up<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.500> or

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
independently so we can fire up one or

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.009 
independently so we can fire up one or
both<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:27.549> let's<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.060> one<00:02:28.299> two<00:02:28.540> now<00:02:28.690> and

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
both so let's just do one two now and

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:50.300 
both so let's just do one two now and
you<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.319> listen<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.769> them

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.559 

adjusted<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.460> to<00:02:51.640> demonstrate<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.150> how

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
adjusted that to demonstrate just how

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.830 
adjusted that to demonstrate just how

towards the job so that I can carry on
working<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.880> saw<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.210> little<00:03:12.450> thermostat

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110

clock<00:03:13.470> behind<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.460> some<00:03:14.610> way<00:03:14.730> I'm<00:03:14.850> going<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
clock behind in some way I'm going to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.760 
clock behind in some way I'm going to
I've<00:03:15.210> taken<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.660> plug<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.110> instead<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
I've taken that plug and instead of the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.390 
I've taken that plug and instead of the
plug<00:03:17.010> I'm<00:03:17.670> going<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.030> insert<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:19.400> thermostat

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
plug I'm going to insert the thermostat

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.990 
plug I'm going to insert the thermostat
itself<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.840> we<00:03:21.960> just<00:03:22.110> plug<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.550> we

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
itself so we just plug that in and we

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.190 
itself so we just plug that in and we
have<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.360> same<00:03:25.760> effect<00:03:26.760> now<00:03:27.150> I've<00:03:27.720> set<00:03:28.020> that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
have the same effect now I've set that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.460 
have the same effect now I've set that
to<00:03:28.410> five<00:03:28.620> degrees<00:03:29.070> quite<00:03:29.310> clearly<00:03:30.260> we<00:03:31.260> need

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
to five degrees quite clearly we need

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
to five degrees quite clearly we need
that<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> bit<00:03:31.890> client<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.330> turn<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
that a bit client so as I turn the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:48.510 
that a bit client so as I turn the
heater<00:03:33.930> up<00:03:35.690> come<00:03:36.690> on

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.300 

turning<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.240> down<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:50.710> will<00:03:50.860> cut<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.130> heater

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
turning that down it will cut the heater

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.540 
turning that down it will cut the heater
out<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.390> when<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.690> heater<00:03:52.950> when<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.130> air<00:03:54.310> in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
out so when the heater when the air in

the room reaches the temperature set on
the<00:03:57.190> thermostat<00:03:57.720> it'll<00:03:58.720> turn<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.110> off<00:03:59.520> to<00:04:00.520> turn

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
the thermostat it'll turn it off to turn

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:11.400 
the thermostat it'll turn it off to turn
it<00:04:00.850> up<00:04:00.970> again<00:04:01.090> all<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.110> have<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.560> do

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.660 

now<00:04:12.410> that's<00:04:12.590> really<00:04:12.830> very<00:04:13.130> handy<00:04:13.550> because

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
now that's really very handy because

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.190 
now that's really very handy because
this<00:04:14.030> cave<00:04:14.270> was<00:04:14.480> probably<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.870> couple<00:04:15.050> of

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
this cave was probably a couple of

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.530 
this cave was probably a couple of
meters<00:04:15.530> long<00:04:15.740> so<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.370> can<00:04:16.850> cite<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.300> wherever

the power of these twin combustion
chambers<00:04:28.040> this<00:04:28.730> will<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.330> can<00:04:29.510> set<00:04:29.780> this<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.140> two

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
chambers this will I can set this to two

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.990 
chambers this will I can set this to two
or<00:04:30.470> three<00:04:30.500> within<00:04:31.040> two<00:04:31.310> or<00:04:31.400> three<00:04:31.520> degrees
