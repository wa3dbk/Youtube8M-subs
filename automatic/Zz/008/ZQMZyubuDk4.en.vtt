going on up there maybe this thing's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.030 
going on up there maybe this thing's
unstable<00:01:53.390> but<00:01:54.140> while<00:01:54.440> you're<00:01:54.740> doing<00:01:55.010> that

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
unstable but while you're doing that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.180 
unstable but while you're doing that
it's<00:01:55.460> also<00:01:56.020> animating<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.200> crazy-looking

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's also animating this crazy-looking

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.290 
it's also animating this crazy-looking
hook<00:01:58.760> face<00:01:59.260> so<00:02:00.260> little<00:02:01.100> purpose<00:02:01.490> here<00:02:01.730> lots<00:02:02.120> of

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
hook face so little purpose here lots of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.100 
hook face so little purpose here lots of
fun<00:02:02.540> with<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.810> ship<00:02:03.050> wheel<00:02:04.360> now<00:02:05.360> both<00:02:05.750> sides

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
fun with the ship wheel now both sides

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.960 
fun with the ship wheel now both sides
of<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.409> ship<00:02:06.680> have<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:07.100> trap<00:02:07.400> doors<00:02:07.729> on

that little peg hole too that you can
change<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.970> position<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.900> cannon<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
change the position of the cannon so the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
change the position of the cannon so the
cannons<00:02:15.920> got<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.099> couple<00:02:16.370> places<00:02:16.609> where<00:02:16.819> could

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
cannons got a couple places where could

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.360 
cannons got a couple places where could
be<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.359> can<00:02:17.540> also<00:02:17.659> be<00:02:17.900> mounted<00:02:18.049> up<00:02:18.530> here<00:02:19.219> if<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
be it can also be mounted up here if you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.340 
be it can also be mounted up here if you
so<00:02:19.760> choose<00:02:20.060> or<00:02:20.389> on<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.719> other<00:02:20.840> side

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
so choose or on the other side

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.260 
so choose or on the other side
so<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.710> lot<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.310> options<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:22.820> but<00:02:22.970> these<00:02:23.210> are

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
so a lot of options there but these are

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.990 
so a lot of options there but these are
again<00:02:23.780> these<00:02:23.960> are<00:02:24.110> both<00:02:24.290> fall<00:02:25.070> away<00:02:25.190> platforms

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
again these are both fall away platforms

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.350 
again these are both fall away platforms
one<00:02:26.330> falls<00:02:26.660> away<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.610> character<00:02:28.970> slides

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
one falls away and the character slides

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.260 
one falls away and the character slides
down<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:29.780> little<00:02:30.050> slide<00:02:30.290> area<00:02:30.560> any<00:02:30.920> safe<00:02:31.370> but

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
down this little slide area any safe but

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.320 
down this little slide area any safe but
this<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.630> falls<00:02:32.930> away<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.530> oh<00:02:34.250> no<00:02:34.460> baby<00:02:34.760> in

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
this one falls away and oh no baby in

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.560 
this one falls away and oh no baby in
the<00:02:36.170> jaws<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.470> tick-tock<00:02:37.450> looking<00:02:38.450> at

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
the jaws of tick-tock looking at

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.130 
the jaws of tick-tock looking at
tick-tock<00:02:39.110> up<00:02:39.380> close<00:02:39.710> there's<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.520> little<00:02:40.790> tail

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
tick-tock up close there's a little tail

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.190 
tick-tock up close there's a little tail
portion<00:02:42.140> here<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.760> use<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.600> snap

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
portion here that you can use to snap

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.070 
portion here that you can use to snap
and<00:02:45.560> chomp<00:02:46.100> things<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.790> yeah<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.780> don't<00:02:47.960> think

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
and chomp things so yeah I don't think

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.280 
and chomp things so yeah I don't think
you<00:02:48.260> want<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.500> fall<00:02:48.710> in<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.160> side<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
you want to fall in this side so the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.290 
you want to fall in this side so the
designers<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.040> toy<00:02:52.250> understand<00:02:53.030> that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
designers of this toy understand that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.450 
designers of this toy understand that
well<00:02:53.600> children<00:02:54.080> like<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.470> lose<00:02:54.620> missiles<00:02:55.190> like

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
well children like to lose missiles like

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.100 
well children like to lose missiles like
these<00:02:55.640> little<00:02:55.910> water<00:02:56.090> missiles<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.780> whatnot

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
these little water missiles and whatnot

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.050 
these little water missiles and whatnot
so<00:02:57.350> they've<00:02:57.530> incorporated<00:02:57.880> some<00:02:58.880> little

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
so they've incorporated some little

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.910 
so they've incorporated some little
perforations<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.290> actually<00:03:00.440> store

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
perforations that you can actually store

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.680 
perforations that you can actually store
the<00:03:01.100> missiles<00:03:01.460> in<00:03:01.640> so<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.360> don't<00:03:02.510> lose<00:03:02.660> them

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
the missiles in so you don't lose them

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.190 
the missiles in so you don't lose them
perfect<00:03:03.880> now<00:03:04.880> let's<00:03:04.910> have<00:03:05.270> some<00:03:05.330> fun<00:03:05.540> we've
