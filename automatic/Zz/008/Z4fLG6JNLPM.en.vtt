 regulatory practice of the individual 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.990
 insurer the regulatory practice can 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.560

 apron with the customer not about it 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.510
 it can speak what is important to him 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.980
 now be expensive for your customers 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.280
 suffer from frequent customers 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.890
 Crack or crack headache 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.600
 pain in the jaw joints 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.850
 ear noise chronic tension of the 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.310
 cervical spine 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.480
 The cause can be a radio manipulation 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.820
 be dysfunctional 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.370
 There are several studies from which 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.030
 shows that 20 percent of tinnitus 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.430
 cases and 30 percent of 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.010
 Tension headaches are their cause in 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.120
 malocclusions of the patients 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.230
 is the functional analysis at 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.480
 Dental treatment in one 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.550
 Supplementary insured 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.970
 Your client can contact his dentist 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.560
 be treated in such cases 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.760
 This treatment is very expensive 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 they can get really expensive 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.870
 avoid tariffs with your own price 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.010
 and benefits are here 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.530
 namely two sticking points 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.270
 firstly, there are no benefits in it 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.130
 are listed are not synonymous 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.660
 insured 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.700
 Second, the prices for 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.590
 benefits to the insurer in the future 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.270
 not adjusted to rise with it 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.050
 automatically your own parts of your 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.080
 There are customers for root treatments 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.370
 three tariff forms in the market 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.120
 either they are not 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.580
 insured 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.280
 or you get paid if the gkv 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.740
 no longer provides any services or in the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.070
 ideally already when the gkv 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.650
 make a study out of the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.420
 Usa rises through the use of additional 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.550
 instruments and longer 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.360
 Treatment time is here up to 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.040
 two hours 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.500
 the success rate at over 80 percent 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.130
 additional instruments is eg an op 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.640
 microscope meant use of it around 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.130
 600 euro cost which takes gkv this 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.030
 do not cost what actually happens 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.680
 if the gkv does not make 1993 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.980
 were big bridges from 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.580
 insurance coverage excluded 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.060
 1997 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.060
 to four years 1979 and younger none 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.659
 performance more for dentures this was 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.520
 then reversed in 1999 like 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:39.849
 see the regulation for this case 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.159
 Supplementary insurances off if the 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.379
 gkv not accomplish some see 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.409
 dental supplement tariffs in the market no 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.479
 performance for your customers 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:52.330
 in the conditions then he brings 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.840
 the gkv no performance accounts for one 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.430
 reimbursement for dentures such as implants 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.400
 and also mentha deep treatment after 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.949
 this tariff argumentative treatment 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.280
 is the necessary bone structure of the before 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:09.310
 an implant supply is pending 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.610
 other tariffs 10 packages from 20 to 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.469
 40 percent depending on the type of treatment from 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.529
 Ownership for your customers increases 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.300
 then clearly there are tariffs the 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.719
 close missing teeth completely from 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.469
 Insurance coverage at some 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.659
 Dental supplement insurance can take up to 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:27.909
 three missing teeth against one 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.039
 premium surcharge or with a strong 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:33.969
 shortened tooth graduation with insured 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:36.099
 will know about dental insurance 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:39.190
 Condition according to waiting times 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.889
 Dental treatment and denture measure 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.839
 of eight months 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.750
 there are only very few insurers who 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.900
 from this regulation in their conditions 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.289
 differ 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.909
 As you can see, there are many criteria 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.370
 the for your customers besides the pure 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.979
 Dentures are important under 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.360
 can be expensive we have this 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.000
 different performance points like 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.509
 burn limits 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.339
 root treatments and 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.009
 Periodontal treatments for her and her 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.379
 Customers in a performance protocol clear 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.529
 understandable and transparent 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.360
 arrested 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.789
 Technical terms are based on 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.659
 Examples explain the performance 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.069
 protocol becomes part of the contract 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.949
 so that the customer has also for the future 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.180
 a performance security 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.879
 why is our coverage concept like this 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.620
 unique we do not have any waiting times 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.639
 neither with dentures nor with 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.409
 dental treatments 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.940
 We can have up to eight missing teeth 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.219
 without contribution surcharges and 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.139
 we exclude disbursements 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.360
 have a full assortment of seven 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.860
 different tariffs the customers theirs 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.439
 living conditions and needs 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.199
 we can also make adjustments 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.659
 if the gkv does not afford that 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.870
 performance protocol becomes 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.759
 contractual ingredient 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.310
