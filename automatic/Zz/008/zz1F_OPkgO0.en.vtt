00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.440
 jose mourinho analyzed the defeat 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.299
 of his team in balaidos with a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.460
 result that leaves everything open 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.100
 for the second leg on January 9 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.860
 in the bernabéu and the Portuguese coach 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.720
 he began his analysis congratulating the Celtic 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.039
 for having deservedly earned the 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.250
 meeting 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.340
 I think that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.440
 I will have been winning a game I think 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.780
 that he 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.590
 the result is 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.130
 adapted 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.710
 maybe they have not done 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.270
 a lot to score two goals but neither 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.480
 we have done a lot to mark 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.440
 one 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 the result for me 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 maybe more adapted to the party is 10 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.570
 Anderson the second game practically 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.040
 without knowing how and they will force us to have 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.130
 a a relationship 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.710
 and we have gotten marked but I 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.770
 it seems that the team has been better 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.700
 best team in the field has deserved to win 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.320
 or parties are winning 2-1 at the break 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.840
 I continue thinking that that is Madrid 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.939
 favorite to win the tie 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.920
 mourinho wanted to explain also because 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.899
 rafa great game in the last 20 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 French forward center minutes 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.740
 I was injured 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.850
 he has been a champion 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 because he has been injured 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.200
 has stayed inside 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.920
 and injured has done more than some that 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.490
 they were not mentioned 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.540
 the boy has a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.780
 a fantastic mentality and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.490
 the injured himself made to go to his 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.290
 work 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.700
 during the centers because I could not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 sprint because he was not in 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.510
 conditions of playing as defender 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.720
 and sometimes we were days we 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.010
 we are with him inside 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.350
 and well inside and well and to finish 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.420
 mourinho reality shot is never good 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.580
 lose but a 2-1 in a match 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.320
 gone makes the tie follow more 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.620
 I live for Real Madrid - and without 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.569
 have to resort to heroic results 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.519
 bernabé not have to earn the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.000
 five zeros we do not have to earn 40 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.950
 We have to win 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.770
 we have to win 10 we have to win 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.180
 yesterday we have to win 21 go to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.400
 extension we have to win 32 to 31 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.690
 we have to win 4-2 we do not have to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.680
 make a result of these results 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.040
 historical comebacks we have 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.200
 simply that you have to win is a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.510
 party that has emotion is a match 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.439
 what 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.439
 we have to 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.230
 that turning it is a result that we have 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.910
 against it is a party that people 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.240
 surely it will go that people 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 will have some kind of 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.010
 of emotion for you for this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.910
 party for that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.440
 me with you thinking we can 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.440
 here we can win the tie
