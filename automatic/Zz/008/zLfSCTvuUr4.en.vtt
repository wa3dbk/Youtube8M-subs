00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.420
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.420
 In the comment of the previous film, a friend said that he would not use XM25 to explode. 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.780
 So this time I will talk about the XM25 weapon. 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.820
 In addition, I will also say that in Battlefield 4, the weapon has the same special function as the XM25. 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.040
 XM25 air blast is a unique weapon for support soldiers 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.720
 The maximum magazine capacity is 5 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.880
 M320 howitzer compared to the assault 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.120
 Advantages except for semi-automatic shooting 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.740
 I still need to change ammunition without having to make a shot. 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.580
 In addition, XM25 has the function of air explosion 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.540
 Can be used as an enemy to attack behind the cover 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.280
 So how do you do it, let me explain it to everyone. 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.720
 When aiming with the XM25 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.280
 In the right position, you can find the distance word 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 On the left is the write position and air burst 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.560
 Distance is the distance between you and the target 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.100
 The value of the position is usually 3 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.180
 Why is it 3? I don't know, it may mean the scope of the explosion. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.220
 The air blast is the distance from the grenade to the air. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.160
 When you want to make an air blast on the top of the enemy’s cover 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.760
 Pointing at the cover first, then aiming 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.440
 At this time, your air blast distance will be set to the distance from the shelter. 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.280
 Then you can shoot at the enemy and use the air to hit the enemy. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.800
 Even if you shoot anywhere, the grenade will still go to the set distance and explode. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.240
 Remember to aim at the shelter first. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.740
 Otherwise, it will only make the grenade become very far or very close. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.120
 Then you can't kill the enemy by air 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.640
 Then, I want to say another weapon with air-explosive performance. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.200
 That is the spring knife unmanned fighter 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.200
 To unlock the spring knife plane, you must first have a piece of information on China's rise. 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.140
 Get another airspace advantage band and three battle jets 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.700
 The spring knife unmanned combat aircraft is also a unique weapon for the support soldiers. 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.580
 Although powerful, it can attack armored vehicles. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.940
 However, because the ammunition has only one, the filling time is very long, so it is used by fewer people. 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.560
 When used, it will be converted into the interface of the spring knife aircraft by pressing the launch. 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.520
 The interface will become like a TV missile, and you can control your flight path. 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.940
 At the bottom right you can see the decreasing green light, which is the battery 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.260
 Automatically explodes when used up 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.180
 Using a spring knife to kill an enemy is as simple as hitting an enemy. 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.340
 But the spring knife plane actually has the performance of air explosion. 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.120
 But you have to unlock the [bomb guest] task first. 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.680
 Unlocking needs to get three bomber throwing bands 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:35.280
 And killing 20 people with a spring knife plane and using a spring knife plane to complete multiple kills. (that is, to kill two or more enemies at the same time) 

00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:42.311
 When you unlock, the interface of the spring knife plane will have more words of the empty explosive warhead below. 

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:49.231
 This means that when you use a spring knife plane, you can press the left button to detonate, you don't have to hit the enemy, you can use the air blast machine to kill people. 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:04:01.000
 But you have to remember that you must unlock the task, otherwise the ordinary warhead can be detonated in the air to make no big lethality. 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.700
 According to what I said is the javelin missile 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.440
 Everyone knows that in Battlefield4 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.560
 Javelin missiles can only attack vehicles on the ground 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.140
 The aerial vehicle is locked in 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.120
 But actually in Battlefield 4 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 The javelin can still attack the vehicle in the air like Battlefield 3. 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.300
 But you must have a teammate to use the laser to help you lock 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.800
 Whether it is a fighter or helicopter, or even a drone, you can attack 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.340
 And the javelin missile has a very powerful vehicle in the air. 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.660
 I can definitely hit you in one shot. 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.280
 If you want to attack airborne vehicles with javelin missiles 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.860
 I suggest looking for a friend to play with the scouts. 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.420
 Otherwise, you can only attack the ground vehicle 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.920
 Finally, I want to say zeroing, zeroing system 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.440
 This system is owned by all sniper rifles and DMR 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.100
 If you are a newcomer with a sniper rifle 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.740
 When using a previous sniper rifle 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.220
 Many times, because the range value of the gun is too low, it is necessary to pre-high position sniper. 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.840
 But I don’t know how much it is. I have to shoot a few shots before I know how many shots I must take. 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.220
 But in fact, Battlefield 4 added the zeroing system. 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.820
 As long as you use a personal laser pointer PLD or a rangefinder on the gun 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.840
 You can find the distance between you and the enemy. 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.120
 Press the v button again to correct the distance between you and the enemy. 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.980
 This will save you from having to predict how much the bullet will fall. 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.180
 I hope this little knowledge can help some friends who haven't known yet. 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.540
 My sharing this time is here. 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.240
 Thank you for watching. 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.420
 I will post every second to third day in the future. 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.560
