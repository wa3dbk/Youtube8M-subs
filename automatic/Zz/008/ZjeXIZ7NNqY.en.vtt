00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
thought it'd be fun to kind of mix the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.560 
thought it'd be fun to kind of mix the

pattern with my top I'm tying it at the
waist<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.230> give<00:02:41.470> more<00:02:41.770> definition<00:02:41.920> there

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
waist just to give more definition there

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.440

my<00:02:43.150> cotton<00:02:43.930> blazer<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:45.370> my<00:02:45.790> gray<00:02:46.120> jacket

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
and that is pretty much the look the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.570 
and that is pretty much the look the
floppy<00:02:50.230> hat<00:02:50.350> isn't<00:02:50.740> necessary<00:02:51.160> here<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.550> I

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
floppy hat isn't necessary here but I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.310 
floppy hat isn't necessary here but I
just<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.970> how<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.180> matches<00:02:52.690> with<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.930> dress

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
and then we're going to go back to that

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.420 
and then we're going to go back to that
button<00:02:56.920> up<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.280> layer<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.610> underneath<00:02:59.430> and

button up and layer it underneath and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.940
