00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.710 

okay<00:00:04.950> so<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.850> first<00:00:05.880> thing<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.300> going<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.540> do

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
okay so the first thing I'm going to do

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.919 
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
with<00:00:07.349> the<00:00:07.680> blood<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.849> see<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.360> signature<00:00:09.660> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
with the blood I see the signature this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
with the blood I see the signature this
time<00:00:11.900> is<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.290> repro<00:00:14.130> file<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.580> grind<00:00:15.090> a<00:00:15.210> much

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
time is to repro file it grind a much

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
time is to repro file it grind a much

bevel on to it in a much deeper bevel
the<00:00:20.839> bevel<00:00:21.839> angle<00:00:21.929> on<00:00:22.169> this<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> very

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the bevel angle on this it's a very

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.609 
the bevel angle on this it's a very
shallow<00:00:23.550> bevel<00:00:24.029> angle<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.079> very<00:00:25.349> steep<00:00:26.329> blunt

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
shallow bevel angle is very steep blunt

shallow bevel angle is very steep blunt
bali<00:00:28.619> angle<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.550> maybe<00:00:29.789> 40<00:00:30.390> degrees

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
bali angle like that maybe 40 degrees

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
bali angle like that maybe 40 degrees
maybe<00:00:31.050> more<00:00:31.380> i'm<00:00:31.739> going<00:00:31.919> to<00:00:32.009> ground<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.460> more

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
maybe more i'm going to ground it more

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.759 
maybe more i'm going to ground it more
like<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:34.129> much<00:00:35.129> more<00:00:35.309> acute<00:00:35.609> the<00:00:36.620> tool<00:00:37.620> of

like that much more acute the tool of
choice<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> belt<00:00:39.239> sander

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
choice to do this would be a belt sander

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.680 
choice to do this would be a belt sander
ideally<00:00:40.199> but<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.949> don't<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.539> could<00:00:42.539> use<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
ideally but I don't have one could use a

multi-tool with a little grinding wheel
on<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:03.719> probably<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> tech<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> while

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
on it it's probably on the tech a while

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
on it it's probably on the tech a while
the<00:01:06.060> pen<00:01:06.270> might<00:01:06.480> get<00:01:06.690> in<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.870> way<00:01:07.010> well<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.580> want

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the pen might get in the way well I want

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.360 
the pen might get in the way well I want
to<00:01:08.880> keep<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> pen<00:01:09.270> Tom<00:01:09.480> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.690> can<00:01:09.870> see<00:01:10.370> more

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
to keep the pen Tom so I can see more

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.340 
to keep the pen Tom so I can see more
clearly<00:01:11.700> worthy<00:01:12.210> anglers<00:01:12.660> if<00:01:12.810> necessary<00:01:13.260> I'll

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
clearly worthy anglers if necessary I'll

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
clearly worthy anglers if necessary I'll
remove<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> paint<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.690> attack<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
remove the paint and this is on attack a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
remove the paint and this is on attack a
while<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.320> I'll<00:01:16.410> at<00:01:16.590> least<00:01:16.620> start<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
while so I'll at least start it and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
while so I'll at least start it and
demonstrate<00:01:18.120> probably<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.900> lot<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> dust

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
demonstrate probably make a lot of dust

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.780 
demonstrate probably make a lot of dust
as<00:01:19.590> well<00:01:19.770> with<00:01:19.950> me<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.190> might<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
as well with me they might have to do it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:50.980 
as well with me they might have to do it
our<00:01:20.940> example<00:01:21.330> anyway<00:01:21.570> he<00:01:21.930> gots<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.290> start<00:01:22.650> with

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.300 

okay<00:01:51.990> well<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.380> start<00:01:53.690> as<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.900> see

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
okay well that's a start as you can see

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.230 
okay well that's a start as you can see
hopefully<00:01:56.660> this<00:01:57.660> region<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.910> I've<00:01:59.910> started

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
hopefully this region here I've started

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.200 
hopefully this region here I've started
on<00:02:01.250> no<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.400> working<00:02:02.670> quite<00:02:02.880> well<00:02:02.910> it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
on no that's working quite well it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
on no that's working quite well it's
making<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.600> dust<00:02:03.840> than<00:02:04.110> I'd<00:02:04.290> hoped<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:05.340> I'm

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
making more dust than I'd hoped so I'm

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.030 
making more dust than I'd hoped so I'm
gonna<00:02:05.550> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.820> continue<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.300> outside<00:02:07.040> and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
gonna have to continue this outside and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.590 
gonna have to continue this outside and
you<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.429> skirted<00:02:08.820> slightly<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:09.479> is

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
you can see it skirted slightly which is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.760 
you can see it skirted slightly which is
put<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> scratch<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.350> blood<00:02:10.500> I'm<00:02:10.619> gonna

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
put a scratch on the blood I'm gonna

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650 
put a scratch on the blood I'm gonna
have<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.040> quite<00:02:11.250> careful<00:02:11.460> about<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:11.940> it's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
have to be quite careful about that it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.320 
have to be quite careful about that it's
not<00:02:12.780> too<00:02:12.990> big<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.200> deal<00:02:13.410> but<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:15.180> is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
not too big a deal but this is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
not too big a deal but this is
definitely<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.930> take<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> while<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
definitely going to take a while the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190 
definitely going to take a while the
blade<00:02:17.640> hasn't<00:02:17.940> heated<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.300> at<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.630> when<00:02:18.870> I've

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
blade hasn't heated up at all when I've

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.710 
blade hasn't heated up at all when I've
been<00:02:19.320> using<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.010> looks<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
been using this so it looks like the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.240 
been using this so it looks like the
kind<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.870> dremel<00:02:22.170> devices<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.130> be<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
kind of dremel devices is going to be a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.130 
kind of dremel devices is going to be a
satisfactory<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.020> was<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
satisfactory for this if it was a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
satisfactory for this if it was a
smaller<00:02:25.470> blood<00:02:26.070> i<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> I've<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
smaller blood i would use a I've got a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.699 
smaller blood i would use a I've got a
diamond<00:02:28.040> whetstone<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.930> using<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.350> using

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
diamond whetstone but using that using

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.990 
diamond whetstone but using that using
the<00:02:31.770> storm<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.490> just<00:02:32.670> too<00:02:32.790> big<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the storm for this is just too big a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.310 
the storm for this is just too big a
blade<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.990> lot<00:02:34.200> quicker

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
blade this is going to be a lot quicker

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.350 
blade this is going to be a lot quicker
we've<00:02:34.620> no<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.070> take<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> while<00:02:35.430> just

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
we've no it's going to take a while just

00:02:36.360 --> 00:03:03.240 
we've no it's going to take a while just
do<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> little<00:02:36.570> bit<00:02:36.870> more

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.589 

yeah<00:03:04.250> may<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.519> wasn't<00:03:04.790> heated<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.150> blood<00:03:05.330> up<00:03:05.480> at

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
yeah may I wasn't heated the blood up at

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.770 
yeah may I wasn't heated the blood up at
all<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.410> going<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.709> satisfactory<00:03:07.430> for

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
all this is going to be satisfactory for

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.949 
all this is going to be satisfactory for
initially<00:03:08.780> reprofiling<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.930> know

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
initially reprofiling it and you know

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.699 
initially reprofiling it and you know
making<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:13.540> deeper<00:03:14.540> but<00:03:14.720> shallower<00:03:15.230> bevel

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
making a deeper but shallower bevel

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.539 
making a deeper but shallower bevel
deeper<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:17.180> way<00:03:17.450> further<00:03:18.200> down<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:18.799> but

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
deeper this way further down here but

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.210 
deeper this way further down here but
much<00:03:20.030> shallower<00:03:20.299> angle<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.860> I'll<00:03:21.980> continue

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
much shallower angle so I'll continue

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.150 
much shallower angle so I'll continue
with<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:23.620> show<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.680> what<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.980> next

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
with this and show you what the next

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.289 
with this and show you what the next
stage<00:03:28.090> right<00:03:29.090> well<00:03:30.670> dermals<00:03:31.670> working<00:03:31.940> okay

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
stage right well dermals working okay

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.000 
stage right well dermals working okay
but<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.080> paint<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.470> getting<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.920> way

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
but the paint is getting in the way

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.670 
but the paint is getting in the way
however<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:35.150> comes<00:03:35.420> off<00:03:35.630> very<00:03:35.900> easily<00:03:36.260> with

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680

moving very easily I'm going to force a
blue<00:03:53.329> patina<00:03:53.840> on<00:03:53.959> this<00:03:54.230> later<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.769> so<00:03:55.010> it'll<00:03:55.190> be

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
blue patina on this later on so it'll be

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.560 
blue patina on this later on so it'll be
nicely<00:03:55.459> blued<00:03:55.820> layer<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.239> vote<00:03:56.329> for<00:03:56.359> the

nicely blued layer to vote for the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.130 
nicely blued layer to vote for the
moment<00:03:56.750> if<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.530> look<00:03:57.650> at<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:57.829> region<00:03:58.220> here

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
moment if you look at this region here

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.630 
moment if you look at this region here

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
here I'll just use the Sun pepper

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:13.160 
here I'll just use the Sun pepper
quickly<00:04:02.000> on<00:04:02.120> it

to destroy the engraved symmetry if I

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.570 
to destroy the engraved symmetry if I
can<00:04:28.330> avoid<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.920> don't<00:04:30.040> know<00:04:30.190> how<00:04:30.310> deeply

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
can avoid it but I don't know how deeply

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.460 
can avoid it but I don't know how deeply
it's<00:04:30.790> engraved<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.700> see<00:04:33.880> oh<00:04:34.470> yeah

of the stone had to redress the stone
but<00:05:07.570> it's<00:05:07.900> got<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.200> job<00:05:08.350> done<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:09.070> little<00:05:09.310> bit

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.260 
been somewhat we profiled with the with
the<00:05:30.250> dremel<00:05:30.700> multi-tool<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.760> as<00:05:33.910> you<00:05:34.000> can<00:05:34.120> see

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
the dremel multi-tool so as you can see

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.090 
the dremel multi-tool so as you can see
that<00:05:34.300> it's<00:05:34.720> it's<00:05:35.110> deeper<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:35.770> it's<00:05:35.920> much

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
that it's it's deeper and it's much

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.320 
that it's it's deeper and it's much
shallower<00:05:36.990> maybe<00:05:37.990> too<00:05:38.230> shallow<00:05:38.500> but<00:05:38.980> I<00:05:39.760> can't

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
shallower maybe too shallow but I can't

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.110 
shallower maybe too shallow but I can't
worry<00:05:40.450> about<00:05:40.600> that<00:05:40.810> later<00:05:41.610> really<00:05:42.610> must<00:05:42.880> buy<00:05:43.090> a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
worry about that later really must buy a

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.320 
worry about that later really must buy a
