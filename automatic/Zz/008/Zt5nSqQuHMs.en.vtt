00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
going to show you that later on in the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.020 
going to show you that later on in the
video<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:13.860> yeah<00:00:14.130> another<00:00:14.519> option<00:00:14.910> we've

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
video but yeah another option we've

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.060 
video but yeah another option we've
already<00:00:15.179> done<00:00:15.389> three<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> these<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.320> here's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
already done three of these and here's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.849 
already done three of these and here's
the<00:00:17.279> fourth<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.180> before<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.230> any<00:00:19.470> further

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the fourth so before we go any further

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.500 
the fourth so before we go any further
with<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.490> video<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.119> thought<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.449> should

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
with this video I thought we should

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.660 
with this video I thought we should
probably<00:00:21.840> review<00:00:22.199> all<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.340> different

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
probably review all the different

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
probably review all the different
options<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.210> we've<00:00:24.359> explored<00:00:24.960> most<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
options that we've explored most of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.210 
options that we've explored most of
which<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.670> been<00:00:26.880> viewers<00:00:27.390> submitted<00:00:27.930> ideas

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
which have been viewers submitted ideas

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.500 
which have been viewers submitted ideas
which<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.550> shows<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.179> kind<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.390> good

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
which really shows you what kind of good

California<00:00:45.500> this<00:00:46.500> was<00:00:46.770> his<00:00:47.160> idea<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.820> think

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
California this was his idea and I think

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
California this was his idea and I think
I<00:00:48.149> might<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.780> best<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:50.010> my

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I might like this best for my

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
I might like this best for my
application<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:51.059> again<00:00:51.329> let's<00:00:51.899> take<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> look

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
application but again let's take a look

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
application but again let's take a look
at<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.250> options<00:00:53.309> everything<00:00:54.090> we've

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
at all of our options everything we've

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
at all of our options everything we've
built<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.870> talked<00:00:55.230> about<00:00:55.500> maybe<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
built and talked about maybe how they

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.139 
built and talked about maybe how they
might<00:00:56.940> work<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:58.550> here<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.760> option

you<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.850> onto<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.659> designed<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.170> speakers

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you want onto it's designed for speakers

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
you want onto it's designed for speakers
we<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.850> bolt<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> small<00:01:24.780> piece<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.049> wood

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
we use it's a bolt a small piece of wood

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
we use it's a bolt a small piece of wood
on<00:01:25.530> -<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.369> put<00:01:26.549> some<00:01:26.759> velcro<00:01:26.970> straps<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
on - and then put some velcro straps on

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.410 
on - and then put some velcro straps on
here<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.530> stuck<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.369> X<00:01:29.579> move<00:01:29.850> LED<00:01:30.240> on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
here and we stuck a little X move LED on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.260 
here and we stuck a little X move LED on
top<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.900> okay<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.030> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
top of it okay so what do I think of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.260 
top of it okay so what do I think of
this<00:01:33.390> option<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> X<00:01:35.460> move<00:01:35.700> but

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this option I like it for the X move but

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
this option I like it for the X move but
quite<00:01:36.450> frankly<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> ugly<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
quite frankly it's kind of ugly and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
quite frankly it's kind of ugly and
clunky<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> definitely<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:38.909> homemade

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
clunky and it definitely looks homemade

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.690 
clunky and it definitely looks homemade
yeah<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.380> could<00:01:40.530> paint<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.979> board<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
yeah we could paint this board and it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
yeah we could paint this board and it
would<00:01:41.820> make<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> look<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.540> better<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.530> we

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
would make it look a lot better but we

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.550 
would make it look a lot better but we
did<00:01:44.159> find<00:01:44.369> better<00:01:44.670> solutions<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.570> probably

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
did find better solutions and probably

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
did find better solutions and probably
more<00:01:46.979> economical<00:01:47.700> solutions<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.630> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
more economical solutions if all you

to<00:05:18.160> do<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.460> go<00:05:18.610> ahead<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:18.910> take<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:19.750> nut<00:05:20.050> off

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
to do is go ahead and take this nut off

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480 
to do is go ahead and take this nut off
of<00:05:20.380> here<00:05:20.530> again<00:05:20.890> this<00:05:21.040> is<00:05:21.250> going<00:05:21.400> to<00:05:21.460> work

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.980 
of here again this is going to work
perfect<00:05:21.970> for<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.150> moon<00:05:22.360> flower<00:05:22.600> or<00:05:22.750> something

LED<00:07:21.140> spots<00:07:21.910> solution<00:07:22.910> number<00:07:23.030> four<00:07:23.390> to<00:07:23.630> the

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
LED spots solution number four to the

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.410 
LED spots solution number four to the
poor<00:07:24.110> man's<00:07:24.440> moving<00:07:25.100> head<00:07:25.310> totem<00:07:25.700> I<00:07:25.850> really

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.420 
poor man's moving head totem I really

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.090 
poor man's moving head totem I really
like<00:07:26.780> this<00:07:27.140> solution<00:07:27.440> because<00:07:27.950> it's

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
like this solution because it's

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.490 
like this solution because it's
lightweight<00:07:28.430> I<00:07:28.940> don't<00:07:29.420> think<00:07:29.720> that<00:07:29.960> most<00:07:30.350> of

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
lightweight I don't think that most of

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.290 
lightweight I don't think that most of
the<00:07:30.560> time<00:07:30.800> I'm<00:07:31.040> gonna<00:07:31.250> need<00:07:31.430> my<00:07:31.610> moving<00:07:32.000> heads

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
the time I'm gonna need my moving heads

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.630 
the time I'm gonna need my moving heads
ten<00:07:32.600> feet<00:07:32.810> up<00:07:32.930> in<00:07:33.050> the<00:07:33.080> air<00:07:33.290> so<00:07:33.950> the<00:07:34.040> dura<00:07:34.250> truss

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.640 
ten feet up in the air so the dura truss

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.300 
ten feet up in the air so the dura truss
system<00:07:34.880> isn't<00:07:35.300> always<00:07:35.600> necessary<00:07:36.470> however

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
system isn't always necessary however

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.790 
system isn't always necessary however
there<00:07:37.820> probably<00:07:38.300> are<00:07:38.600> instances<00:07:39.110> where<00:07:39.440> I<00:07:39.470> am

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 
there probably are instances where I am

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.070 
there probably are instances where I am
gonna<00:07:40.010> want<00:07:40.250> the<00:07:40.340> tripods<00:07:40.940> or<00:07:41.300> the<00:07:41.780> moving

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 
gonna want the tripods or the moving

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.630 
gonna want the tripods or the moving
heads<00:07:42.290> way<00:07:42.470> up<00:07:42.620> in<00:07:42.770> the<00:07:42.830> air<00:07:42.950> so<00:07:43.130> I<00:07:43.220> will<00:07:43.430> need

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640 
heads way up in the air so I will need

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.640 
heads way up in the air so I will need
the<00:07:43.730> crank<00:07:44.000> stands<00:07:44.420> now<00:07:44.810> alternately<00:07:45.440> what

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:45.650 
the crank stands now alternately what

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.800 
the crank stands now alternately what
you<00:07:45.740> could<00:07:45.980> do<00:07:46.190> a<00:07:46.220> compromise<00:07:46.880> of<00:07:47.030> this<00:07:47.240> you

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:47.810 
you could do a compromise of this you

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.930 
you could do a compromise of this you
could<00:07:48.050> use<00:07:48.260> Franken<00:07:48.860> stands<00:07:49.190> to<00:07:49.490> shoot<00:07:49.700> these

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 
could use Franken stands to shoot these

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.780 
could use Franken stands to shoot these
things<00:07:50.000> up<00:07:50.540> I<00:07:50.720> would<00:07:51.080> say<00:07:51.110> I<00:07:51.560> don't<00:07:52.040> know<00:07:52.280> what

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.790 
things up I would say I don't know what

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.960 
things up I would say I don't know what
maybe<00:07:53.780> a<00:07:54.230> little<00:07:55.010> over<00:07:55.190> six<00:07:55.490> feet<00:07:55.730> in<00:07:55.850> the<00:07:55.940> air

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:55.970 
maybe a little over six feet in the air

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.840 
maybe a little over six feet in the air
that<00:07:56.780> would<00:07:56.930> be<00:07:57.080> another<00:07:57.260> good<00:07:57.500> solution<00:07:57.980> so

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:58.850 
that would be another good solution so

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.520 
that would be another good solution so
there<00:07:59.330> you<00:07:59.450> go<00:07:59.630> tell<00:07:59.960> me<00:07:59.990> what<00:08:00.140> you<00:08:00.290> think

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.530 
there you go tell me what you think

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.680 
there you go tell me what you think
we've<00:08:01.130> done<00:08:01.310> several<00:08:01.610> videos<00:08:01.730> on<00:08:02.210> this<00:08:02.390> tell

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.690 
we've done several videos on this tell

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.150 
we've done several videos on this tell
me<00:08:02.780> which<00:08:02.930> one<00:08:03.110> you<00:08:03.260> like<00:08:03.440> the<00:08:03.470> best<00:08:03.620> tell<00:08:04.070> me

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:05.600 
which one you think might work best for

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.290 
which one you think might work best for
your<00:08:06.170> particular<00:08:06.380> application<00:08:07.000> look<00:08:08.000> forward
