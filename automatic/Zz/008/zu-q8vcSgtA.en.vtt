pretty<00:01:10.530> much<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.220> game<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:12.780> game<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
pretty much in this game this game I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.980 
pretty much in this game this game I
lose<00:01:14.220> 3-2<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.770> what<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> did<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.990> instead

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
lose 3-2 to and what I did was instead

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.300 
lose 3-2 to and what I did was instead
of<00:01:19.170> putting<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.549> entire<00:01:21.030> match<00:01:22.100> like<00:01:23.100> on

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
of putting like the entire match like on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
of putting like the entire match like on
here<00:01:23.520> because<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> entire<00:01:24.990> match

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
here because if I put the entire match

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.460 
here because if I put the entire match
it<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.700> been<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.170> entire

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it would have been I think the entire

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.399 
it would have been I think the entire
game<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.890> 32<00:01:29.790> minutes<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.420> played<00:01:30.720> we

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
game was 32 minutes that I played we

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
game was 32 minutes that I played we
went<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:31.860> two<00:01:32.250> overtimes<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.270> my<00:01:33.840> team

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
went into two overtimes and my team

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
went into two overtimes and my team
sucked<00:01:35.009> balls<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.540> say

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
sucked balls I have to say

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
sucked balls I have to say
they're<00:01:37.409> horrible<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.610> two

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
they're horrible the only two

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
they're horrible the only two
people<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.630> did<00:01:39.960> something

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
people that actually did something

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.420 
people that actually did something
worthwhile<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:41.100> green<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.960> red<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.070> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
worthwhile was green and red I think I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
worthwhile was green and red I think I
think<00:01:44.640> green<00:01:44.970> scored<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> first<00:01:45.720> goal<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.259> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
think green scored the first goal and in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.810 
think green scored the first goal and in
red<00:01:46.619> scored<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.430> last<00:01:47.610> goal<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
red scored the last goal and then the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
red scored the last goal and then the
last<00:01:51.090> goal<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.720> scored<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
last goal they got scored on me was in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.780 
last goal they got scored on me was in
the<00:01:52.950> second<00:01:53.280> overtime

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the second overtime

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
the second overtime
I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.750> two<00:01:54.869> overtimes<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> could

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I think it was two overtimes it could

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.109 
I think it was two overtimes it could
have<00:01:55.770> been<00:01:55.860> three<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.820> even<00:01:56.939> know<00:01:57.090> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
have been three I don't even know I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.600 
have been three I don't even know I
stayed<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.540> match<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:57.860> like<00:01:58.860> 30<00:01:59.340> minutes

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.420 

what<00:02:03.610> else<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.650> have<00:02:05.860> any<00:02:05.979> questions<00:02:06.310> on

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
what else if you have any questions on

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.279 
what else if you have any questions on
if<00:02:06.520> it<00:02:06.580> feels<00:02:06.759> different<00:02:07.030> I'm<00:02:07.780> not<00:02:08.020> sure

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
if it feels different I'm not sure

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.010 
if it feels different I'm not sure
because<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:09.149> barely<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.330> any<00:02:10.479> attributes

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020

goal too but it was a good save like I
meant<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> say<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> was<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> lucky<00:02:29.709> save<00:02:29.920> but

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it was really good but um when you get

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.140

it you can upload 500 point stats up on
each<00:02:37.360> set<00:02:37.750> which<00:02:38.709> sounds<00:02:39.489> like<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.640> lot<00:02:39.730> but

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
each set which sounds like a lot but

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.880 
each set which sounds like a lot but
it's<00:02:40.239> really<00:02:40.300> not<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.690> lot<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:41.050> stats<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.769> be

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
it's really not a lot of stats to be

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.180 
it's really not a lot of stats to be
putting<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.489> stuff<00:02:42.910> it's<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:44.190> reality

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.590 
putting on your stuff it's in reality
terms<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.300> sounds<00:02:46.690> more<00:02:46.870> like<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.080> hundred

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
terms it it sounds more like a hundred

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.520 
terms it it sounds more like a hundred

say that I played in a show of 12 goalie

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.229 
say that I played in a show of 12 goalie
the<00:03:02.709> entire<00:03:03.010> year<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.519> was<00:03:03.549> out<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.209> I

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
the entire year that it was out and I

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.300 
the entire year that it was out and I
have<00:03:04.420> my<00:03:04.450> legend<00:03:04.810> 3<00:03:04.989> card<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.799> go<00:03:06.040> right

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
have my legend 3 card that go right

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.720 
have my legend 3 card that go right
there<00:03:06.549> I<00:03:06.790> made<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.750> save<00:03:07.989> but<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.920> bounced<00:03:09.549> off

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
there I made the save but it bounced off

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.789 
there I made the save but it bounced off
and<00:03:10.209> my<00:03:10.840> reaction<00:03:11.170> wasn't<00:03:11.470> quick<00:03:11.739> enough

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
and my reaction wasn't quick enough

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.620 
and my reaction wasn't quick enough
because<00:03:12.280> my<00:03:12.430> stats<00:03:12.730> aren't<00:03:13.000> high<00:03:13.120> when<00:03:13.480> you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
because my stats aren't high when you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.229 
because my stats aren't high when you
when<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.290> do<00:03:14.440> your<00:03:14.470> goalie<00:03:14.769> stats<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:15.940> do

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
when you do your goalie stats you can do

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.090 
when you do your goalie stats you can do
shot<00:03:16.780> reaction<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.620> think<00:03:18.549> it's<00:03:18.640> called<00:03:18.820> or

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
shot reaction I think it's called or

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.140 
shot reaction I think it's called or
can't<00:03:21.100> remember<00:03:21.130> what<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.609> want<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.820> call<00:03:21.970> it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
can't remember what you want to call it

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.810 
can't remember what you want to call it
but<00:03:23.079> if<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.100> don't<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.430> high<00:03:24.549> your

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
but if you don't have it high your

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.660 
but if you don't have it high your
goalies<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.209> gonna<00:03:25.299> react<00:03:25.660> really<00:03:25.959> quick<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670

when you're playing goalie and you first

start out like you normally think hey

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.750

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
why should stay in a butterfly the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.310 
why should stay in a butterfly the
entire<00:03:46.209> time<00:03:46.450> I'm<00:03:46.570> in<00:03:46.630> case<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.900> puck<00:03:47.109> comes

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
entire time I'm in case the puck comes

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.039 
entire time I'm in case the puck comes
at<00:03:47.470> me<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:48.010> should<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:48.609> be<00:03:48.760> doing<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.060> you

would<00:03:50.170> think<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.500> that's<00:03:50.739> logical<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.370> it's

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
would think that that's logical but it's

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.590 
would think that that's logical but it's
not<00:03:51.640> like<00:03:52.570> if<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:52.810> stay<00:03:53.049> in<00:03:53.380> butterfly<00:03:54.600> what

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
that's gonna make happen is if say a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.090 
that's gonna make happen is if say a
puck<00:03:58.450> comes<00:03:58.840> at<00:03:59.019> your<00:03:59.140> shoulder<00:03:59.590> length<00:03:59.829> and

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
shots about to be made I heard Ben swoop

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.960 
shots about to be made I heard Ben swoop
down<00:04:27.410> which<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.010> don't<00:04:28.160> think<00:04:28.370> that's<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.820> big

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
down which you don't think that's a big

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.120 
down which you don't think that's a big
difference<00:04:29.120> but<00:04:29.480> it<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.680> big<00:04:30.980> difference

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
difference but it it is a big difference

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.659 
difference but it it is a big difference
so<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:32.180> you're<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.360> starting<00:04:32.630> out<00:04:32.900> at<00:04:33.020> goalie

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
so if you're just starting out at goalie

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.000 
so if you're just starting out at goalie
just<00:04:34.669> keep<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.510> mind<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:36.080> that<00:04:36.830> was<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
just keep that in mind and that was the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.490 
just keep that in mind and that was the
final<00:04:37.370> goal<00:04:37.880> that<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.180> scored<00:04:38.510> on<00:04:38.600> me<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:38.930> second

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
final goal that I scored on me in second

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.260 
final goal that I scored on me in second
overtime

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
overtime

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.200

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
usually when a game first comes out and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.010 
usually when a game first comes out and

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.960 
and it has oil on it usually it's kind
of<00:04:57.169> laggy<00:04:57.350> it's<00:04:58.040> not<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.430> big<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.640> a<00:04:58.700> deal<00:04:58.820> to

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970
