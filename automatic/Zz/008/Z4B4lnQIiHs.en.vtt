00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
like the storyline was so thin and it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
like the storyline was so thin and it
felt<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.580> were<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.850> being<00:00:54.150> led<00:00:54.449> from

much<00:00:59.760> involvement<00:01:00.269> in<00:01:00.479> it<00:01:00.600> apart<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
much involvement in it apart from the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.780 
much involvement in it apart from the
fact<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.769> team<00:01:02.010> members<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> any
