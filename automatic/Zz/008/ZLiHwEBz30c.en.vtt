brought plant on the still ability to

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.170 
brought plant on the still ability to
grow<00:01:38.229> together<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.740> catcher<00:01:38.950> crossed<00:01:39.280> we<00:01:39.940> can

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
grow together the catcher crossed we can

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.660 
grow together the catcher crossed we can
always<00:01:40.450> point<00:01:40.600> about<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.020> props<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.830> with

always point about the props and with

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.490 
always point about the props and with
changing<00:01:43.119> weather<00:01:43.330> patterns<00:01:43.450> do<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.259> think

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
changing weather patterns do you think

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.320 
changing weather patterns do you think
it<00:01:44.590> might<00:01:44.770> be<00:01:44.800> better<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.310> grow<00:01:45.640> food<00:01:45.970> all

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
it might be better to grow food all

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.940 
it might be better to grow food all
under<00:01:46.869> quality<00:01:47.410> tunnel<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.830> future<00:01:49.950> good

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
under quality tunnel and future good

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.020 
under quality tunnel and future good
question

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.190 

why<00:01:54.659> not<00:01:55.280> because<00:01:56.360> polytunnels<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.840> create

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
why not because polytunnels can create

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.730 
why not because polytunnels can create
two<00:01:58.440> problems<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.190> humidity<00:01:59.690> it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
two problems with humidity it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.500 
two problems with humidity it
hard<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.579> control<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.970> temperature

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.490
