in<00:00:00.450> this<00:00:00.659> video<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.170> explore<00:00:01.530> several<00:00:01.829> cue

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in this video we explore several cue

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.370 
in this video we explore several cue
ball<00:00:02.429> position<00:00:02.850> control<00:00:03.300> options<00:00:03.750> for<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> shot

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
ball position control options for a shot

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.829 
ball position control options for a shot
nearly<00:00:04.770> straight<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.250> we'll<00:00:06.210> start<00:00:06.540> with<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
nearly straight in we'll start with the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.600 
nearly straight in we'll start with the
shot<00:00:07.049> shown<00:00:07.379> here<00:00:07.740> or<00:00:07.859> wish<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.250> pocket<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
shot shown here or wish to pocket the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
shot shown here or wish to pocket the
two<00:00:08.820> ball<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.210> get<00:00:09.389> position<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.080> three

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
two ball and get position on the three

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:38.490 

you

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.240 

[Applause]

[Applause]
now<00:00:42.250> let's<00:00:42.460> look<00:00:42.580> at<00:00:42.700> options<00:00:43.090> 1<00:00:43.450> again<00:00:43.750> the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
now let's look at options 1 again the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.570 
now let's look at options 1 again the
shot<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.200> nearly<00:00:44.380> straight<00:00:44.650> in<00:00:44.830> but<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.400> cue

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
shot is nearly straight in but the cue

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.890 
shot is nearly straight in but the cue
ball<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:45.850> object<00:00:45.940> ball<00:00:46.240> are<00:00:46.450> close<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.810> the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
ball and object ball are close to the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.460 
ball and object ball are close to the
rail

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:11.460 

you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.840 

the<00:01:12.470> shot<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.710> nearly<00:01:13.070> straight<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:13.520> so

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
the shot is nearly straight in so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.220 
the shot is nearly straight in so
normally<00:01:14.210> be<00:01:14.330> very<00:01:14.510> difficult<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.020> get<00:01:15.110> the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
normally be very difficult to get the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.380 
normally be very difficult to get the
cue<00:01:15.410> ball<00:01:15.560> away<00:01:15.890> from<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.160> rail<00:01:16.340> however<00:01:17.240> if

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
cue ball away from the rail however if

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.120 
cue ball away from the rail however if
we<00:01:17.480> elevate<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.960> cue<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.410> cheat<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.710> pocket

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
we elevate the cue and cheat the pocket

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.950 
we elevate the cue and cheat the pocket
slightly<00:01:19.550> we<00:01:19.850> can<00:01:20.000> hop<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.360> cue<00:01:20.540> ball<00:01:20.720> into

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
slightly we can hop the cue ball into

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.690 
slightly we can hop the cue ball into
the<00:01:21.170> rail<00:01:21.320> cushion<00:01:21.710> having<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.190> deflect<00:01:22.490> away

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
the rail cushion having it deflect away

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.150 
the rail cushion having it deflect away
from<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.940> rail<00:01:23.380> with<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.500> shot<00:01:24.770> need<00:01:25.010> to<00:01:25.070> be

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
from the rail with the shot need to be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.710 
from the rail with the shot need to be
careful<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.610> not<00:01:25.640> jump<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.090> cue<00:01:26.330> ball<00:01:26.480> too

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
careful to not jump the cue ball too

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.290 
careful to not jump the cue ball too
much<00:01:26.920> if<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.100> cue<00:01:28.250> ball<00:01:28.370> hits<00:01:28.580> too<00:01:28.820> far<00:01:29.060> in

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
much if the cue ball hits too far in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.730 
much if the cue ball hits too far in
from<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.720> nose<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.050> cushion<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:30.530> won't

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
from the nose of the cushion it won't

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.170 
from the nose of the cushion it won't
deflect<00:01:31.130> from<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.400> rail<00:01:31.550> very<00:01:31.760> much

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
deflect from the rail very much

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.960 
deflect from the rail very much
we<00:01:33.020> also<00:01:33.350> risk<00:01:33.620> fouling<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.430> cue<00:01:34.580> ball<00:01:34.730> leaves

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
we also risk fouling the cue ball leaves

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.450 
ball of both frozen to the rail but
they're<00:01:42.320> reasonably<00:01:42.620> close<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.040> pocket

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
they're reasonably close to the pocket

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.820 
they're reasonably close to the pocket
we<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.729> some<00:01:43.880> additional<00:01:44.060> options

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:57.510 

you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.410 

cueball<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.670> driven<00:01:58.880> into<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.240> rail

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
cueball is driven into the rail

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.360 
cueball is driven into the rail
compressing<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> cushion<00:02:00.590> enough<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.160> still

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
compressing the cushion enough to still

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.890 
compressing the cushion enough to still
make<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.610> shot<00:02:01.820> while<00:02:02.150> giving<00:02:02.450> us<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.690> rail

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
make the shot while giving us a rail

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:17.180 
make the shot while giving us a rail
first<00:02:03.170> type<00:02:03.470> action

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.380 

you<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.340> see<00:02:18.519> why<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.700> shot<00:02:19.000> would<00:02:19.120> be<00:02:19.150> much

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
you can see why the shot would be much

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.729 
you can see why the shot would be much
more<00:02:19.599> difficult<00:02:19.660> if<00:02:20.230> there<00:02:20.410> were<00:02:20.530> greater

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
more difficult if there were greater

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.470 
more difficult if there were greater
distances<00:02:21.250> between<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.730> balls<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
distances between the balls and the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.869 
distances between the balls and the
pocket<00:02:22.840> with<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.040> technique<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.640> fairly

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
pocket with this technique it's fairly

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.220 
pocket with this technique it's fairly
difficult<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.510> send<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> object-ball

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
difficult to send the object-ball

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.190 
difficult to send the object-ball
straight<00:02:26.680> down<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.010> rail
