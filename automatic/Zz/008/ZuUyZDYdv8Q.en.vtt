00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi good people today are here to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.420
 start a new series on the channel that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.580
 I 'm talking a little about school 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.559
 good Japanese and for the first video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 of this series I decided to choose the theme 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 about rules are not smart enough 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.789
 brazil and other countries also have a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.650
 thought or some do not have any 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 thought that the school 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.990
 Japanese type military school because 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.840
 is much too rigid rule is only 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.330
 also not as hard as that in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.149
 Yes, that's a pretty rule. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.190
 much more with rigid speech than schools 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 with American has a lot of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.160
 rule, but it is also not common in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.930
 military school 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
 I separated from the rules for this 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.100
 telling you that I think I 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 I think all schools have these 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.110
 rules at least I think it might be that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.510
 have any school any uses knows 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 a little more liberal than they have 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.020
 these rules here but I think the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 most have so I will be 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.469
 sharing with you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.020
 Good people and the first rule is that you 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.300
 can not stop in the molds of the times if 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.519
 Did you get there at school and go? 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.970
 enter the school and the teacher saw our 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.500
 lot love am back home 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 You have to go home, that's right. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 You do not have to go back to your home. 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.170
 You 're not back home, sir. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 take our then back again to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 school then you know it's very annoying it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 so sometimes it is with this the end of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 family week barely miss 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.509
 shout forget to make the arrive in the afternoon 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 but honey always occurs with the enamel 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.409
 You 're going to have to go home and take it. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.909
 the enamel because they do not allow 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.890
 nail polish 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.130
 The second rule is that you can not 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.650
 move us or shadow or base or 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.360
 nor can anything be voted on in the house 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.220
 the only thing you can do is to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 I think neither makeup nor butter 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.030
 cocoa they say what kind if you pass 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.240
 makeup draws much attention from the boy 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.649
 and it kind of will disrupt the studies and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 nani then you can not pass 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.079
 makeup and cr is that you can not 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.119
 paint the hair people have type or 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.490
 like coloring your hair your tresses 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.799
 lights only you can not paint the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.020
 hair then if you painted your hair and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.030
 go to school and they realize that 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.039
 Did you make lights or make strands in the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 Roman 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.870
 You make me go and make you come back with the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.969
 color of your normal hair so you can 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.129
 back to school otherwise you will be staying 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.200
 like not going to school because you will not 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.480
 to be able to enter school with the hair 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.120
 painted the fourth rule that you can not 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.819
 take to school at least in my 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.790
 school I think that in most 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.200
 majorities of the decent stutter school can not 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.019
 take cellphone 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.569
 they do not leave it if they have some 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.159
 Japanese that takes hidden uses in the middle 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.930
 from the hidden class so 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.239
 The studio at least in my living room had 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.120
 some million that used mexico can not 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.090
 to be wait they kind of take the cell phone goes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 do your father and in school look for 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.439
 can not take your telescopic fork 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.389
 here on pilgrim you can not 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.939
 your own clothes you have to with a 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:01.000
 even people here or elsewhere 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.769
 place in the bar show when school 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.430
 primary you can with your own 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.680
 clothes 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.319
 only when you enter the gym that 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.189
 This is the case where I am now 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.319
 gym nÃ© 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.299
 Do you have a uniform to wear? 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.090
 inside the school and then told the school 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.680
 you can not wear your own clothes 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.870
 This is a bit annoying you have to use 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.840
 uniform even when people 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.389
 ray that rigid of this school knows the 6th 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.729
 line is that you can not with shoes nor 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.769
 more colorful nor hairy little girl 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.919
 how does he know that your little 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.709
 hair has to be navy blue or 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:39.109
 brown you can not wear white rose 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.229
 red these things knowing clear 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.299
 Why do not you mention that team is here? 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.099
 I think in your hair I do not know that 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.699
 will mess up at school but he will not 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.799
 leaves 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.290
 6 You only have to wear white stockings not 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.569
 may have a pink ribbon that they do not 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.760
 should happen even white and have this 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.799
 also can not have colorful registration 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.989
 and if it can not be completed it has 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.540
 that being white also the seventh line that 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.549
 You can not put your 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.129
 things like BB comes not knowing 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.540
 I'm know they do not let them think 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.189
 who only works with inter will 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.109
 company that is making noise because 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.040
 Japanese who likes to put knows knows and 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.310
 you see 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.590
 no one will stay 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.660
 I was going to keep trying to make noise 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.880
 tactic can not put even in the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.220
 backpack and neither seen but brother you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.350
 eighth rule is that you can not 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.860
 like chile running to school in the 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.230
 primary school and in the gym they have 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.210
 a certain backpack that they ask for 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.370
 for you to buy and you try was at 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.500
 school style there when you enter 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.960
 high school depending on you 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.389
 you can color doze but that's a 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.520
 So if you plan to go pro 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.040
 Japan and entering elementary school or 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.900
 gym so you'll already know 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.600
 that you can not use michelin 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.720
 a color scheme is that you do not 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.090
 You can take these brazil people. 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.400
 a rule that I really think a lot 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.229
 very annoying is you can not take the 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.900
 eyebrow type girl talk to 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.820
 eyebrow almost 1m of mac gifts you 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.100
 can not take the eyebrow because that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.260
 can not take on they do not leave 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.660
 You sure that's okay that when you 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.740
 In the gym you take it in the middle to 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.510
 do not stick steal gold in k1 it and killed 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.280
 joking, I'm speaking here in the 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.590
 environment and had a little bit here 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.020
 but it stays like this if they realize they are 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.770
 a little attention and the tenth rule is 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.450
 that you can not carry type gibbs like that 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.610
 a place for him in school you have to 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.010
 take a book that goes kind ah and 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.690
 talk on inspire you choose do not know 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.169
 explain the mexico right may lead 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.850
 gibbs 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.800
 if these things you can not take 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.320
 You have to bring a book that will know 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.690
 Are you going to help at school? 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.360
 How did you guys see the Japanese school? 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.039
 so it's a bit stiff but it 's not so 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.630
 How are you doing, huh? 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.550
 beyond these lines that I told 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.139
 You have several other rules too. 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.030
 who does not see and point out of my head 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.280
 but depending on the school will also 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.770
 changing each school every way 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.780
 which teaches students good staff then 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.880
 This was the video as you saw it. 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.919
 proof video from my school as you 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.510
 You know I'm in the gym so it has to be 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.979
 I have to wear a uniform, I do not 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.720
 I can like the clothes 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.100
 so I came here out of the way because 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.780

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.639
