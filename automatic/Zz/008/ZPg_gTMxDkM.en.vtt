00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
which obviously does not do very much

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300 
which obviously does not do very much
damage<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> does<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.680> seem<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.159> any

the dexterity to wield this weapon but
that<00:01:28.650> doesn't<00:01:29.040> matter<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.460> even<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.090> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that doesn't matter because even if you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.969 
that doesn't matter because even if you
don't<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> stats<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> wield<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> this

weapon<00:01:32.430> has<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> best<00:01:33.450> Perry's<00:01:33.930> in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
weapon has one of the best Perry's in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.950 
weapon has one of the best Perry's in
the<00:01:34.290> game<00:01:34.640> there<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:36.090> daggers<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the game there are other daggers and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
the game there are other daggers and
weapons<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.070> parry<00:01:38.400> animation

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
weapons that have this parry animation

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.340 
weapons that have this parry animation
however<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.159> weapons<00:01:41.159> parry<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.930> much

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
however this weapons parry is much much

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.649 
however this weapons parry is much much
better<00:01:43.649> than<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.399> other<00:01:44.520> parry<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
better than any other parry that is in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.160 
better than any other parry that is in
this<00:01:45.960> game<00:01:46.170> regardless<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.340> shields<00:01:47.970> or

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
this game regardless of shields or

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.800 
this game regardless of shields or
weapons<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:50.100> reason<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> not

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
weapons the reason for that is that not

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.410 
weapons the reason for that is that not
only<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.399> parry<00:01:53.820> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
only is the this parry which is the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.139 
only is the this parry which is the
heavy<00:01:54.780> attack<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.950> weapon<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.820> only<00:01:57.090> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
heavy attack for this weapon not only is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.539 
heavy attack for this weapon not only is
the<00:01:57.299> parry<00:01:57.540> faster<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> active<00:01:59.310> window

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the parry faster but the active window

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.179 
the parry faster but the active window
seems<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.420> longer<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:01.020> well<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.799> I'm<00:02:01.979> not

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
seems to be longer as well now I'm not

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
seems to be longer as well now I'm not
sure<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:03.000> agility<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:04.320> has<00:02:04.469> anything

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sure if your agility really has anything

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.520 
sure if your agility really has anything
to<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.759> number<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> active<00:02:07.170> frames

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to do with the number of active frames

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.880 
to do with the number of active frames
of<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.009> parries<00:02:08.459> window<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:10.229> agility<00:02:10.770> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
of this parries window but my agility is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.280 
of this parries window but my agility is
not<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.489> high

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
not very high

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.320 
not very high
for<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.650> character<00:02:12.920> which<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.670> my<00:02:14.030> dark

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
for this character which is my dark

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.410 
for this character which is my dark
build<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.950> lowest<00:02:16.159> agility<00:02:16.849> of<00:02:17.030> all<00:02:17.269> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
build it's the lowest agility of all the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.649 
build it's the lowest agility of all the
characters<00:02:17.659> I<00:02:17.989> have<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.890> 90<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.480> I'm

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
characters I have this is 90 so and I'm

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.949 
characters I have this is 90 so and I'm
finding<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.530> quite<00:02:21.590> easy<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.640> nail<00:02:23.329> this<00:02:23.599> parry

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
finding it quite easy to nail this parry

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.880 
finding it quite easy to nail this parry
in<00:02:24.260> PvP<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.900> really<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.439> good

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
in PvP so it's really really good

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.759 
in PvP so it's really really good
extremely<00:02:28.489> useful<00:02:28.940> now<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.629> you<00:02:29.780> look<00:02:30.019> at<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
extremely useful now if you look at the

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.550 
extremely useful now if you look at the
weapons<00:02:31.129> stats<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.120> really<00:02:32.690> unimpressive

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
weapons stats it's really unimpressive

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460 
weapons stats it's really unimpressive
as<00:02:33.860> far<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:34.670> goes<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.659> strat<00:02:35.989> really

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
as far as that goes but the strat really

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.819 
as far as that goes but the strat really
is<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:37.340> carry<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.879> on<00:02:38.090> your<00:02:38.750> left<00:02:39.290> hand<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
is to carry this on your left hand and

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.300 
is to carry this on your left hand and
then<00:02:40.310> use<00:02:40.609> it<00:02:40.640> as<00:02:40.989> basically<00:02:41.989> as<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> shield

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
then use it as basically as a shield

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.250 
then use it as basically as a shield
you<00:02:43.640> don't<00:02:43.909> obviously<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.780> can't<00:02:45.079> really

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
you don't obviously you can't really

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.740 
you don't obviously you can't really
block<00:02:45.560> with<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.829> but<00:02:46.459> you're<00:02:46.760> pairing<00:02:47.269> instead

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750
