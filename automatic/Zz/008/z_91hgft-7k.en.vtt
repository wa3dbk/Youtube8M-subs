Kinect everything that makes this game
fun<00:00:45.629> comes<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> fact<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.920> uses

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
fun comes from the fact that it uses

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.510 
fun comes from the fact that it uses

on the animated movie of the same name
we<00:01:03.329> always<00:01:03.629> say<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.559> say<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
we always say this but we say this for a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
we always say this but we say this for a
reason<00:01:05.580> games<00:01:06.299> based<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.840> movies<00:01:06.900> are

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
reason games based on movies are

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
reason games based on movies are
generally<00:01:08.130> terrible<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> come

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
generally terrible so when you come

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
generally terrible so when you come
across<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> isn't<00:01:10.500> well<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.430> an

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
across one that isn't well it's an

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
across one that isn't well it's an
occasion<00:01:11.790> worth<00:01:12.150> celebrating<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> its

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
occasion worth celebrating and to its

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.210 
occasion worth celebrating and to its
credit<00:01:13.650> Kung<00:01:14.580> Fu<00:01:14.610> Panda<00:01:14.880> 2<00:01:15.540> isn't<00:01:16.140> terrible

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.890 

so<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.340> game<00:01:22.549> is<00:01:22.580> basically<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.420> one-on-one

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900

on Kinect that is to say it works

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.550

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
thing is that what makes it good is also

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
it also makes the game feel very
