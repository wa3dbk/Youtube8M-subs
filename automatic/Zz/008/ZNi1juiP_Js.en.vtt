00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.600
 belt 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.800
 I want to buy click know what 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.340
 the parameters suit me better yet 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.130
 ride 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.650
 above are selected in your opinion 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.880
 ride and then actually collect the rule 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.570
 beginners it 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 I go to save they go with a narrow waist 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.690
 about seventy seventy two can 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.199
 74 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.720
 they are soft the ski softer the easier 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.760
 learn because soft ski forgives 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.070
 a lot of unnecessary movements which are two 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.510
 beginner will in any case be more 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.280
 hard skis for the field sure 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.870
 boiler user and although speed and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.000
 the sharpness of the transfer to the ski 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.450
 right you are selected for growth and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.940
 weight but on average it is minus 10-15 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.480
 from height centimeters if this is the same 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.910
 For years, well, to begin with, this is always the height 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.940
 then we go to standard under 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.590
 chin is minus 10 15 if it goes 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.470
 universal ski it will be 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.390
 minus 5 minutes of growth so and if 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.910
 freeradius off-piste on 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.160
 bad snow then it will either be in 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.930
 growth is either higher and depends on body build 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.420
 person month average person 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.069
 complexion then we go start creating 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.170
 is there a bigger person then 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.509
 he needs time that tower taller because 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 and it turns out on the same rose up with us 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.880
 rises and jump higher 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.880
 this is a miracle 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.270
 well heard thought up and how am I 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.010
 pick up a mount my husband about one or 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.140
 per watt in the center all skis go 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.370
 Bonding service center will put you 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.630
 effort and put 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.630
 namely sales of boots 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.979
 the chairs will not pick up shoes 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.070
 are also selected on the stiffness of each 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.020
 boot there is an indicator here to show and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.110
 50 is me days and boots for 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.939
 beginners are also very well suited 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.170
 boots 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.060
 matched to the width of the pads well and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.009
 Naturally in size than tougher 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.479
 batina especially for professional 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.149
 level it is used 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.420
 hedgehogs usually do not use shoes 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.099
 and tougher than 60 but if you 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.959
 you get tired of super staff then 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.599
 moves to 70 or 80 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.540
 so I still need in addition to ski 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.840
 mount to the cinema well of course ski 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.400
 digging sticks are also matched by height 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.700
 choose the right shelf 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.319
 turn it over and take it under the ring exactly 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.590
 around the ring because this part will be under 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.390
 snow with a properly selected shelf 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.739
 corner 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.690
 if compressed nails the angle here should 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.980
 get 90 degrees well this one 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.980
 wand it is a little bit small 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.980
 but brother 2 gain fighters gear 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.489
 type lived on his heart you get 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.489
 is free
