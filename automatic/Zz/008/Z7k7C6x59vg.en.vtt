00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.860
 yes 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.469
 what has been more than clear until the 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.389
 moment is that in battlefield 4 could 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.730
 be the title that surprises us most 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.800
 graphically during the first months 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.050
 of the consoles of the 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.090
 next generation we are talking about 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.029
 a title that takes advantage of this new engine 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.369
 frostbite graphic 3 that creation of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.590
 daisy electronic arts has distributed a 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.720
 new video of battlefield 4 in this 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.250
 time his development team 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.920
 focuses on showing us all 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.079
 characteristics of that frostbite 3 is the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.180
 new graphic engine as I already say and 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.250
 besides eye explain to us all the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.260
 possibilities offered to do the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.560
 gaming experience of this fourth 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.320
 much more immersive and realistic delivery 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.360
 there is no more to see the images of what 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.370
 that can be achieved with that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.520
 graphic engine and that is that there are many 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.810
 elements that that frostbite 3 provides 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 destruction without total limits 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.620
 interactivity with the different 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.170
 stages lots of players in 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.449
 screen particles explosions all 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 realistic lighting type and a lot of eye 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.280
 a great mission that you have with this one 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.750
 butterfield 4 and is the one to get that 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.210
 the title work 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.220
 images per second on the consoles of 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.560
 the next generation are not going to allow 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.260
 not a single drop of frames and in 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.300
 playstation 4 nor in xbox one we'll see 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.400
 if this really they get it because 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.500
 Of course if they get it with that 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.380
 level of image quality that has 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 battlefield 4 could be amazing and 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.170
 in addition it would automatically become 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.940
 All a reference in the graphic point of 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 what has to be a video game of 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.080
 next generation of course you 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.330

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.420
 images of battlefield 4 with a good 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.880
 5.1 sound system because after 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.340
 this game what will bring us is the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.320
 war to our rooms we will be more 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.119

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.470
 become the true reference of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.810
 the war in the world of videogames 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.180

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.690

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:39.130

 fifth part of 'resident evil' the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.610
 first time this saga stepped on the high 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.110
 definition finally the time has come 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.840
 and it has had to happen a lot 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.540
 time until we come back in this 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.700

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.660
