at these little chocolaty burger things

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.880 
at these little chocolaty burger things
I'm<00:03:34.190> assuming<00:03:34.730> they're<00:03:34.880> like<00:03:35.060> cookies<00:03:36.019> with

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.300 
I'm assuming they're like cookies with
chocolate<00:03:36.920> in<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.640> middle<00:03:37.970> um<00:03:38.980> they<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.130> kind

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
chocolate in the middle um they be kind

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.470 
chocolate in the middle um they be kind
of<00:03:40.370> freaky<00:03:40.640> if<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:40.790> were<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.030> hamburger

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
of freaky if they were like hamburger

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.400 
of freaky if they were like hamburger
flavor<00:03:41.660> but<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.019> think<00:03:42.260> they're<00:03:42.380> just

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
flavor but I think they're just

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.199
