so then I I grow very attached I mean
being<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.250> Arab<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.880> thought<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.690> Yemen

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
being an Arab I thought going to Yemen

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.890 
being an Arab I thought going to Yemen
as<00:02:28.260> an<00:02:28.380> Arab<00:02:28.710> country<00:02:28.740> no<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.270> easy<00:02:30.540> but

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
as an Arab country no this was easy but

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.810 
as an Arab country no this was easy but
it<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.260> like<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.160> completely

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
it was like going to a completely

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.230 
it was like going to a completely
foreign<00:02:33.540> country<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.730> couldn't<00:02:35.730> understand

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
foreign country I couldn't understand

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.940 
foreign country I couldn't understand
the<00:02:36.390> language<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:37.080> couldn't<00:02:37.380> understand<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the language I couldn't understand the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.980 
the language I couldn't understand the
dialect<00:02:38.520> took<00:02:38.760> me<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> very<00:02:39.000> long<00:02:39.300> time<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
dialect took me a very long time to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.110 
dialect took me a very long time to
acquire<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.770> understand<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.580> be<00:02:41.700> able<00:02:41.730> to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
acquire and understand and be able to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.910 
acquire and understand and be able to
speak<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> woman<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.660> was<00:02:45.990> young<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.710> was

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
speak it I was a woman I was young I was

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.540 
speak it I was a woman I was young I was
good-looking<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.910> was<00:02:48.120> very<00:02:48.150> difficult<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
good-looking so it was very difficult to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.430 
good-looking so it was very difficult to
manage<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:50.940> way<00:02:51.120> around<00:02:51.420> there<00:02:51.600> being<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.230> my

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
manage my way around there being on my

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.430 
manage my way around there being on my
own<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:53.520> was<00:02:53.940> extremely<00:02:54.390> difficult<00:02:54.690> terrain<00:02:55.290> I

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
own it was extremely difficult terrain I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.030 
own it was extremely difficult terrain I
think<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.570> must<00:02:57.570> also<00:02:57.780> admit<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.650> there's<00:02:58.950> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
think I must also admit that there's a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.910 
think I must also admit that there's a
lot<00:02:59.280> of<00:03:03.140> self-fulfillment<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> sense

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
lot of self-fulfillment in the sense

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.670 
lot of self-fulfillment in the sense
that<00:03:05.070> when<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.460> went<00:03:05.880> there<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.270> was<00:03:07.020> not<00:03:07.440> only

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that when I went there I was not only

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.670 
that when I went there I was not only
though<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.190> was<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.120> only<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.660> only<00:03:10.440> woman

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
though I was not only the only woman

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.090 
though I was not only the only woman
there<00:03:11.270> doing<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.420> work<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.800> many<00:03:14.010> cases

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
there doing this work but in many cases

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.060 
there doing this work but in many cases
I<00:03:14.760> was<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> first<00:03:15.390> kind<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.530> foreign

I mean in the UK as well as in so it

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.360 
I mean in the UK as well as in so it
seemed<00:04:13.860> Liam<00:04:14.129> passionate<00:04:14.700> about<00:04:15.000> at<00:04:15.269> all<00:04:16.370> s

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
seemed Liam passionate about at all s

buildings<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.239> Yemen<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.660> wouldn't<00:04:18.900> call<00:04:19.109> them

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
buildings in Yemen I wouldn't call them

buildings in Yemen I wouldn't call them
earth<00:04:19.530> buildings<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.489> would<00:04:20.760> be<00:04:20.940> more<00:04:21.180> specific

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
earth buildings I would be more specific

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.629 
earth buildings I would be more specific
because<00:04:22.049> there<00:04:22.500> are<00:04:22.620> various<00:04:22.979> types<00:04:23.310> of

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
are three main types of stone buildings

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.180 
are three main types of stone buildings
the<00:04:42.030> mud<00:04:42.240> brick<00:04:42.449> buildings<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.410> shape

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
the mud brick buildings and the shape

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.490 
the mud brick buildings and the shape
buildings<00:04:44.760> buildings<00:04:45.120> made<00:04:45.539> out<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.900> shape<00:04:46.199> as

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
buildings buildings made out of shape as

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.860 
buildings buildings made out of shape as
basic<00:04:47.130> materials<00:04:47.699> for<00:04:47.910> constructing<00:04:48.570> walls

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
basic materials for constructing walls

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.740 
basic materials for constructing walls
now<00:04:49.770> how<00:04:50.010> they're<00:04:50.340> made<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.940> extremely

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
now how they're made is extremely

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.840 
now how they're made is extremely
complex<00:04:52.260> because<00:04:52.620> Yemen<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.280> one<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.669> most

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
complex because Yemen is one of the most

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.960 
complex because Yemen is one of the most
sophisticated<00:04:55.430> civilizations<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.729> has

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
sophisticated civilizations that has

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
sophisticated civilizations that has
maintained<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.840> continued<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.860> constructed

300 and some more years but we know for
a<00:06:18.350> fact<00:06:18.380> that<00:06:18.740> these<00:06:18.950> buildings<00:06:19.550> have<00:06:19.670> been

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
a fact that these buildings have been

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.390 
a fact that these buildings have been
there<00:06:20.240> since<00:06:20.510> pre-islamic<00:06:20.930> times<00:06:21.470> so<00:06:22.160> we're

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
there since pre-islamic times so we're

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.820 
there since pre-islamic times so we're
talking<00:06:22.610> with<00:06:23.170> civilizations<00:06:24.170> is<00:06:24.380> all<00:06:24.620> this

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
talking with civilizations is all this

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.250 
talking with civilizations is all this
ever<00:06:25.220> and<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:27.580> Queen<00:06:28.580> of<00:06:28.640> Sheba<00:06:28.790> I<00:06:29.210> do<00:06:29.360> but

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
ever and the Queen of Sheba I do but

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.140 
ever and the Queen of Sheba I do but
then<00:06:30.500> again<00:06:30.620> in<00:06:31.040> what<00:06:31.250> Hadron<00:06:31.790> would<00:06:31.970> I

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
then again in what Hadron would I

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.030 
then again in what Hadron would I
discussed<00:06:32.600> this<00:06:32.840> and<00:06:33.140> I<00:06:33.260> think<00:06:33.320> if<00:06:33.830> you<00:06:34.010> go

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
discussed this and I think if you go

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.520 
discussed this and I think if you go
back<00:06:34.340> to<00:06:34.400> Genesis<00:06:35.090> you'll<00:06:35.450> find<00:06:35.750> dimension<00:06:36.350> of
