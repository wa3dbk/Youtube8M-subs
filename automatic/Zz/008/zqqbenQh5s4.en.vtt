00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the boarding but still it seems like in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
real explosive draws I'm not sure what I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
real explosive draws I'm not sure what I
would<00:00:49.920> change<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> might<00:00:53.129> maybe

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
would change here I think it might maybe

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.910 
would change here I think it might maybe
take<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> leaf<00:00:54.449> ground<00:00:54.719> elder<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.260> like

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
take out a leaf ground elder or like

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
take out a leaf ground elder or like
these<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> cards<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.719> or

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
these these are the cards like one or

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.380 
these these are the cards like one or
two<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.440> leaf<00:00:58.590> crown<00:00:58.770> elders

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390

are<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> cards<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.149> be

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
are the cards that I think can be

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
are the cards that I think can be
changed<00:01:03.809> although<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
changed although I don't know what I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
changed although I don't know what I
would<00:01:05.369> change<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.850> spite<00:01:06.150> bellows<00:01:06.510> we

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
would change it for spite bellows we

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.050 
would change it for spite bellows we
never<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.170> used<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.610> seems<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
never really used but it seems like a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
never really used but it seems like a
card<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.920> the
