00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.230
 yes 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.370
 hi friends today I'm going to tell you about 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.230
 trick that really is not a trick but 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.980
 is a function that comes with the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.710
 apple safari browser on the iphone and 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.050
 in all the mac is also very function 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.070
 important that allows you to open more than 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.380
 an internet window at the same time 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.270
 let's open to see what I'm 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.579
 speaking now it is opening and as 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.160
 you can see here there is a button an icon 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.360
 they say two that means there are two 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.870
 pages loaded or reaper and already in the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.730
 browser if I give you a click there squeezed 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.440
 there you will see that it has become smaller 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.600
 the yahoo screen that we were 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.530
 watching and gives me the opportunity to with the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.620
 finger make a slide or scholes and when 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.369
 I do that presents the other screen of 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.549
 internet or re browser screen that 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.010
 is open and to access side everything 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.460
 what you have to do is press 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.830
 is going to open the screen now if 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.370
 want to create a new screen is very 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.950
 simple simply press here 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.250
 see the button that says newpage that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.290
 Spanish system should be a new page 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.330
 squeeze and this factory will create a new 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.850
 blank page where you can 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.220
 expose an internet address here or 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 look for a direct search in 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.010
 google simply squeezing where it says 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.710
 google and doing your search 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.870
 it's very important for multitask and we 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.150
 we go multitasking if you yes for 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.880
 make a copy-paste from one page to another 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 this is totally indispensable because 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.930
 simply doing it in what you 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350
 see here you can copy information from this 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.600
 page 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.690
 then minimize if you want to call or 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.090
 minimize and open the other and make a 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.950
 very simple test easy but at the same 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.680
 very powerful time 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.330
 and very convenient, I'm going to do 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.800
