00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.670
 personal speech of the symphony club 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.070
 I'm a naldÃ£o and today I'll give you tips 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
 concerning the height of our 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.480
 instrument which is the basis for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.800
 regulating this theme was a suggestion 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 daniel marson 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 this question is very interesting since 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 nowadays we see several types of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 styles of music shows and in them the most 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.519
 various types of bass and bass 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.650
 obviously its performance and there is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.570
 enters that particularity each 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 play a little on your wave 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.380
 so I'll explain first 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 from the point of view more correct and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.579
 economical for our body and not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.579
 bring us no evil, come on 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 the correct posture to play and which 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.320
 is healthy for our spine as 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.039
 reference is the position you touch 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 seated 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.300
 just as I am about to take into account 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.699
 that in this posture we spend hours and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.160
 so studying there the point of 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.290
 match for you to do an analysis 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.760
 in practice this is so when you are 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.510
 sitting still unregulated running 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.100
 handle height 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.229
 see that you can play again 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 sitting correctly you perform all the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.860
 techniques and etc. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.009
 in this position of sitting then justice 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.170
 strap for the bass stays in that position 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.700
 without leaving neither higher or lower leaves 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.040
 run adjusted to stay in shape 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 normal with low sitting height 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.439
 look at this position 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.210
 When you get up you'll see that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.579
 this height of the bass strap will be 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.259
 for a better execution of the test 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.450
 You play all the techniques well. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.130
 Pleasing that the height you are 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 accustomed to studying and sitting 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.940
 I particulary leave the regular line 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.190
 a little looser not to 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.240
 get so high and so is each staff 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.920
 choose your 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.410
 I also indicate besides making a 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.270
 sitting practice also as you go 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.190
 do live on stage that same 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.950
 studio also to be able to have a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.950
 idea is cool and makes you well prepared 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 of course there are several types of 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.630
 height that each one enjoys more etc 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
 this should not be taken as a rule 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.430
 there are several factors that influence this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.680
 height that each one ends of the tank 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.900
 I'll take as an example bass players who 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.670
 you should have seen playing with the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.400
 belt height well adjusted to the body 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.860
 the instrument will be at the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.709
 this option is the guy who really likes 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.780
 tep and lap and mainly hands 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.060
 are techniques that the guy has to have 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.739
 a lot of precision and for that Brazil 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.390
 need to be closer to the field of 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.390
 vision and more than my body 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.500
 another person we see a lot is the guy 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.630
 that already plays with the time of the well run 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.440
 the instrument is there. 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.799
 down 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.480
 Look, this option was already the guy who is 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.760
 with a style that does not use these 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.019
 techniques that I talked about earlier 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.060
 plays accurately 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.100
 more precisely in this seam in the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.200
 most times the guy develops a 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.769
 straight line down to using 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.769
 jacket or not 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.900
 some considerations that I will make 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.460
 now is the following it is important to remember 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.440
 that some belt heights 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.510
 along high low 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.540
 sometimes it's linked to x we'll see if 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.800
 Shocking down there on the foot may be more 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.570
 off and on and on 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.460
 the stylus that tend to want to change the 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.950
 concerned about a video of the 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.980
 band and performance and other things more 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.290
 It's very cool, but I believe that. 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.000
 must have a certain balance and never 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.690
 should overlap what is best for you 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.450
 by a musician, that is the satisfaction 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.430
 that adjusting the height of the belt 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.470
 this example fades from the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.540
 metallica in an interview taught me 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.030
 the various health problems that 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.450
 acquired and function of several factors and a 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.370
 would be the posture of how to play the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.680
 great balcony is to be attentive to the posture 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.030
 which is more comfortable for running and 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.460
 for your column too 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.500
 remember if you care for the races 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.120
 broader like this one 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.350
 so the pressure of men is more 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.240
 distributed 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.400
 the weight of the instrument is something that should be 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.160
 take into account also if you face 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.050
 a tour or a heavy schedule of shows 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.370
 Good people, I hope I have helped in this 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.169
 doubt I hope you have enjoyed 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.540
 keep sending your doubts to 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:59.300
 people here are good but I'm staying for 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.300
 here thanks to the gift and until the next 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.190
 free
