time<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:39.250> they<00:02:39.430> knew<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> most<00:02:39.940> important

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
time that they knew the most important

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.380 
time that they knew the most important
thing<00:02:40.630> was<00:02:40.810> our<00:02:40.960> togetherness<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:43.000> we

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
thing was our togetherness and and we

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.830 
thing was our togetherness and and we
became<00:02:43.870> an<00:02:44.020> identity<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.710> just<00:02:45.220> us<00:02:45.430> playing

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
became an identity and just us playing

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.080 
became an identity and just us playing
so<00:02:46.840> hard<00:02:47.140> every<00:02:47.800> night<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:48.160> was<00:02:48.700> really

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
so hard every night out was really

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.640 
so hard every night out was really
instrumental

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.050
