I'm<00:05:37.690> going<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.200> take<00:05:38.380> sincere<00:05:38.830> from<00:05:39.400> mac<00:05:39.639> and

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000

I'm going to take sincere from mac and
i'm<00:05:40.780> just<00:05:40.900> going<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.229> contour<00:05:41.650> my<00:05:41.710> face<00:05:41.830> with

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.460

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.809 
so there's not much blush in this video

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
probably because the eyes are so intense
