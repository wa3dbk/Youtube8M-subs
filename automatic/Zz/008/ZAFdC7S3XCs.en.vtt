hold<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.010> ball<00:04:14.190> up<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.490> make<00:04:14.610> up<00:04:14.790> for<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.180> so

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
hold the ball up and make up for it so

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.120 
hold the ball up and make up for it so
