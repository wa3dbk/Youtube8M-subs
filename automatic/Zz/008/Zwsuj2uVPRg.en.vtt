00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.130
 either brown world 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.240
 drew a strip like here with a marker 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:13.040
 try stainless steel preli rap 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.130

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.690
 we will have a bullying up on the left 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.360
 the right side will sink down 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.360
 you don't do anything else 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.250
 and again it is convenient if we have some 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:52.599
 obstacle we need scissors 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:52.599
 reverse release set here 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:04.450
 in the right scissors the right rachelle will 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.450
 lifted up their businesses started up the bottom 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:25.330

 met better cut on one side 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:45.270
 circle cut circle left scissors 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.270
 stainless steel foil 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.909
 threw 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.740
 yes the sponge is oiled 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.520
 it is better than mana going on 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.520
 distortion of sponges that is very convenient 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.520
 cut out 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.000
 You can also cut internal 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.920
 holes but you need to do 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.860
 a hole so that the sponge penetrated there and 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.140
 It can be cut at least a part of just such a 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.860
 it's a hole with a better diameter there 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.610
 somewhere 13 millimeters to catch on 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:48.540
 sponge accordingly here right 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:50.600
 scissors we cut in the opposite direction 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.600
 there is 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.460
 if you feel some kind of emphasis is better 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.460
 cut there 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.490
 such 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.040
 circle ready 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:22.379
 There is of course a minus but again from 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:26.669
 Intensive work is slipping 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:33.869
 rubber handles had to be left back 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:36.830
 but some there are sown on glue to 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:36.830
 pen did not crawl 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:46.500
 one millimeter below things began to 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:50.229
 coping these scissors but again not 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:55.150
 Whether for such long can such a short 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.810
 cut there die cut making excellent 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.139
 scissors 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.820
 a simple rubber grip handle 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:13.870
 interesting here is structured here 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:16.169
 so for scissors tightening is always needed 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.010
 key 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.010
 key on 11 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.140
 address 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.710
 this way regulated work is needed 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.710
 don't need a goal 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:42.280
 very good they are not hotris before leaving 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:49.750
 clean sponge smeared with main weapon and 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:53.320
 greased sponge left and right scissors and 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.320
 craft supermarket 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.780
 purchase 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.780
 that's all for now
