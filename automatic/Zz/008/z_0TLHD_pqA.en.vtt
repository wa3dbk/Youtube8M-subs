00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.370
 the new high efficiency washing machines 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.559
 Six sense use advanced technology to 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 Throughout the cycle we will show you how 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.420
 the new six washers work 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.609
 High efficiency senses use less 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 water than traditional washing machines 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.600
 this reason we recommend the use of a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 High efficiency detergent that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.949
 produces less foam looks for the label 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 high efficiency in the box or on the basis of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.560
 detergent first add the measure of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.989
 detergent h to the dispenser that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 find the center of the drawer do not fill 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.489
 no dispenser beyond the line 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.860
 of maximum filling because he over 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.800
 filling can cause the product to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 empty too soon if your model does not 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 account with dispenser adds the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.230
 detergent directly to the basket of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.440
 washed 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.329
 load the washing machine add the laundry 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.809
 uniform way in loose heaps 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.970
 around the wall of the basket for 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.180
 avoid damage to the garments never 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.229
 fabric softener you add chlorine 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.730
 directly on the garments in the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.310
 washing machine 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.870
 when using fabric softener is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.630
 you need to press the button 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.600
 fabric softener to free it from 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.120
 Appropriate way if your model does not count 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.730
 with dispenser add the softener in 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.490
 the container down and vol and place it 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.350
 directly on the garments closes the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 top and select the configuration 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.850
 desired wash cycle to start the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 light of the census indicator will light 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.050
 to determine the size of the load 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 immediately the lid will be blocked 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.070
 you forgot to add a garment once 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 started the cycle you can press the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.470
 Pause button and open the washing machines 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.120
 sixers with washing system h2o seibert 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.250
 sense in the size of the load and it 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.500
 adjust to the selected cycle first 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.510
 spin on the dry charge then add the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.100
 water and move it by pausing for 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.590
 Allow time for water to soak 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.360
 clothes so the clothes will be wet 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 although they are not submerged under water 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.740
 the water temperature is determined 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.050
 by the system that the control of agreement 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.480
 to the selected configuration once 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.399
 that you get the detergent is released to 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.530
 throughout the cycle the water jets 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.240
 they mix the detergent or the fabric softener 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.220
 fabrics before flowing inside 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.320
 the basket the soaking cycle 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.270
 provides additional water and time for 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.580
 work on difficult spots and the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.590
 dirt the soak time can be 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.360
 adjust by pressing the level button 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.030
 dirt to achieve a clean 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.100
 deep the agitator 3 to carve the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.800
 garments against each other the action 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.080
 Combined 3d agitator and basket 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.970
 in the opposite direction move the load to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.430
 through the water to clean all the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.620
 garments taking care of the tissues when finishing 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.550
 Washing the load is centrifuged with 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.890
 the technology 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.900
 quiet spine to remove the detergent and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.670
 the dirt that are in the water for 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.680
 start rinsing the mixture 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.920
 fabric softener with water will flow 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.800
 about the load during the squeezing 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.870
 final the system quiet spine centrifuge 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.090
 to load at higher speeds for 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.100
 maximize water extraction this 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.410
 it will help to minimize the drying time 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.270
 and achieve maximum energy savings 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.520
 once the cycle has finished the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.990
 washing machine unlocks and turns on the 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.990
 Indicator light ready
