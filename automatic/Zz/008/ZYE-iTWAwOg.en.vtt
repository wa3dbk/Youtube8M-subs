00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is the mechanical shutter that's built

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
is the mechanical shutter that's built
into<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.960> camera<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.979> camera<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.369> an

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.780 
so the toggle between the two shutter
mode<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.740> need<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.430> press<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
mode all you need to do is to press the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
mode all you need to do is to press the
feature<00:01:56.969> button<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.229> option<00:01:58.590> with

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
feature button you get an option with

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.370 
feature button you get an option with
mechanical<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> electronic<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
mechanical and electronic so a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.399 
mechanical and electronic so a
mechanical<00:02:02.100> shutter<00:02:02.399> mode<00:02:03.079> when<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> fire

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
mechanical shutter mode when you fire

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.290 
mechanical shutter mode when you fire
off

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
off

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.080 
off
you<00:02:07.110> hear<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.410> mechanical<00:02:08.010> shutter<00:02:08.610> in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you hear the mechanical shutter in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.810 
you hear the mechanical shutter in
action<00:02:09.740> if<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:10.830> talk<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
action if you talk of it to the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.680 
action if you talk of it to the
electronic<00:02:12.360> mode<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:15.030> will<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.270> using<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
electronic mode this will be using the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
electronic mode this will be using the
electronic<00:02:16.250> shutter<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.550> allows<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.600> to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
electronic shutter and allows you to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.370 
electronic shutter and allows you to
fire<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.290> 60<00:02:19.650> frames<00:02:19.860> per<00:02:19.980> second<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
fire up to 60 frames per second so the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.080 
fire up to 60 frames per second so the
electronic<00:02:22.830> shutter<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.790> very<00:02:23.820> very

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
electronic shutter is actually very very

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.540 
electronic shutter is actually very very
good<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.870> don't<00:02:25.500> want<00:02:25.740> any<00:02:25.980> vibration

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
good if you don't want any vibration

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.060 
good if you don't want any vibration
when<00:02:27.180> you're<00:02:27.390> using<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.990> camera<00:02:28.230> because

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
when you're using this camera because

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.190 
when you're using this camera because
the<00:02:29.400> shutter<00:02:29.640> its<00:02:30.330> actually<00:02:30.840> using<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the shutter its actually using the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.820 
the shutter its actually using the
sensor<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.190> shuttle<00:02:32.940> itself<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.990> that's

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
sensor as the shuttle itself and that's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.510 
sensor as the shuttle itself and that's
it<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.490> nikon<00:02:36.240> 1<00:02:36.540> v1<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
it for the nikon 1 v1 and the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.090 
it for the nikon 1 v1 and the
differences<00:02:39.030> between<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.510> nikon<00:02:39.900> 1<00:02:40.080> v1<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
differences between the nikon 1 v1 and a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.480 
differences between the nikon 1 v1 and a
j-1<00:02:41.610> lots<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.060> interesting<00:02:42.510> differences<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
j-1 lots of interesting differences and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.230 
j-1 lots of interesting differences and
yeah<00:02:44.490> pretty<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.240> that's<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:47.240> thank

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
yeah pretty much that's that's it thank

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.900 
yeah pretty much that's that's it thank
you<00:02:48.270> very<00:02:48.480> much<00:02:48.600> for<00:02:48.630> watching
