00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.680 
the fly it's like as I as I'm doing them
I<00:02:40.380> write<00:02:41.380> everything<00:02:41.680> down<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:43.300> not<00:02:43.510> like

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
I write everything down it's not like

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
so very few are done that way mainly

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.940 
so very few are done that way mainly
because<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.720> can't<00:02:52.959> find<00:02:53.170> my<00:02:53.380> recipes<00:02:55.950> all
