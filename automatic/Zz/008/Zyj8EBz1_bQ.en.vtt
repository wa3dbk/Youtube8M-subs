00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi everyone has wallowed game 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.210
 do not end up at for a new 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 new video in any case excuse me 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 which will not be a tutorial or an episode 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.519
 of gameplay 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 it will be a complement so it's very 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.550
 important to look through to the end 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.039
 because it's for the the tutorial for 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.130
 a bus server leave I had a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 little problem with with a friend there 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.890
 could not connect he had a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 message like java connection 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 exception and I looked at a lot 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 a lot of forums and it was 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.170
 the opening of the ports so I got 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.160
 said well here's me I opened my 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.840
 pigs in the firewall here fire 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.890
 windows 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.010
 advanced traffic rules settings 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 incoming and so I had created a tcp port 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 a port udp that I have but here so it's 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.590
 an aulas sword is actually that serve to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.400
 open the pores of 5.5 6 5 in tcp udp 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.130
 name to create a rule just you 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 make new rules port tcp udp 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.170
 do not have to put it like that I 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.030
 will you put the tutorial when connects 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 at the server there is the game explains you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.970
 how to do the problem is that I have 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.270
 a freebox and I did not know how 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.549
 open my pores so I found in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 it's very simple it's not like 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.360
 it's not like everyone else actually 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.040
 it's not like it's not like 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.549
 like the bbox livebox let-do 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 extra 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.979
 so it had to be on free go on the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.850
 so the ground your subscribers space on my 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.860
 freebox configure my router is so 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.270
 here you will have redirect and lease dhcp 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 and here you will have a redirection of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 ports so you'll just need to create two 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 ports udp tcp 2 5 6 5 with ip and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.160
 destination then the idea of ​​destination 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.080
 what is it? 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.390
 exactly lipped that I showed you 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.630
 in the in the tutorial then I m you 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.790
 normally here or here the video the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 moment in any case where I explain you 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.440
 what it is how do you find it a 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.460
 can only return the address that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.950
 is here and validated so by clicking on 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.540
 the little plus so 200,5 6.5 and that this 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.780
 bow star to click on the little more 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.220
 this is me I'm going to delete 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.950
 then you will have more than 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 save the settings and restart 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.680
 your router so restart your box 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.840
 for the bbox livebox and 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.740
 it's exactly the same for 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.480
 all so I can not show you 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.650
 all the pictures it's very simple you 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.650
 will each time have the same interface 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.430
 I take sfr here you are you 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.740
 will find that something like this 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.590
 so you will click on a tab that 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.580
 will be called nat and you will have the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.250
 your port name would open the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.870
 protocol so on sfr it is particular 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.940
 you have both, ie tcp 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.310
 and udp if you do not have both of us 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.080
 let's create two type so you 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.739
 put port port excellent bits and 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.690
 205 6 5 speaks of his nation 205 6 5 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.570
 lipped destinations as I told you 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.910
 to get to this page where v who 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:42.730
 if there is a little trick a little address 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.870
 and with 192 168 points 1.1 and ben in 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.420
 does it's just an address 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.180
 ip that you have to go home once you 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.980
 have copied pasted actually and this 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.750
 ip address it's not the same as the one 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.090
 that I put you in the video of 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 tutorial this is the one that's the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.260
 default gateway so watch out 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.690
 in easy steps reborn your machine but the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.030
 wireless network wi fi and that's the one 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.980
 so normally all freeboxes be 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.200
 a 192 points 68 points 0 points 2 154 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.359
 for others I do not know at all 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.950
 so selected you select this 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.910
 type and control these 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.010
 in your bar here account 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.430
 here and try so you'll have your 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.590
 window just to click on nate format 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.940
 text have for me it's all 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.320
 information which my flow etc 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.260
 see I restarted my router so that 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.430
 see each other and then you valley of

 port worth you click on the small 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.950
 arrow 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.070
