00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.590
 good so I do not remember what that 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.510

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.059
 tacc we'll see if I remember 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.230
 good as I did a nice little 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.510
 carnage because the dragons it's 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.800
 really on power and it's really 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.300
 Great 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.470

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.699
 informs me today I have I'm going 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.309
 enter two videos on youtube 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.440
 so there a video on call of duty that 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.970
 will go out before or after this one I do not 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.059
 do not know so I invite you to go to 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.739
 see if you like it so I think that 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.530
 it is to say that I will attack tumoral 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 and I too have a fate of rage 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.430
 of spells of cum if dragon an end i 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.930
 sorcerer so good we'll see now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.350
 I use I advise you to do 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.829
 it's three to three sisters of rage 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.539
 really great on rage good there I 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:23.979
 wanted and it's nothing pt1t there for 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:26.850
 so that the dragons can not do 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.829
 can not lose too many lives good voila 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.240
 still the 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.490
 the essential is really overpowering 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.750
 is powerful enough anyway and here I 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.359
 you will make our video maybe with 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.090
 attac dragon level 2 the elks chu yo 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.329
 like a day and tomorrow they will be ready 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:50.049
 to go tomorrow the video because I do not 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:53.710
 could not there but two then there you 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.359
 see him next or but dragon and that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.979
 makes a real carnage and barley that 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.079
 if you see lower left did it 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.079
 do not move so I only concluded that the 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.679
 fairy can not forgive energy to 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.679
 air units 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:10.000
 good then we wanted it to be nice 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.440
 small garage despite foot a tower 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.069
 of archers to overturn everything on the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.870
 dragons or is that asia and bars there 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.520
 they still have a lot left over so the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.530
 dragons it's really great the only one 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.140
 downside is that much but long enough 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.330
 to be made since you only have one 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.400
 box and 1 at the beginning we can do that 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.630
 three by three so there are three I 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.430
 would crack after two hours already 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.260
 so it's a bit long but otherwise 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.560
 it's really exceptional it's great 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 that's it, I think you doubt it 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.420
 I completely explode it now 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.550
 there I heat plan seen that will come to see 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.230
 the king of barbarians I will make myself a 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.210
 little trophy session I will try to 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.210
 go up to 1500 that's how 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.640
 so if you have not seen my life from this 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.860
 call of duty 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.500
 I invite you to go see the chain of 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.590
 my friends then there is the peg of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.540
 83 who makes jailbreak videos on 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.250
