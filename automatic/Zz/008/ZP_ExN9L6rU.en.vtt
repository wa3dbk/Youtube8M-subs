00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.609
 here we have 

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.609
 nor did he emphasize that he is a lawyer a little bit bigger 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.229
 quite bigger than people of different 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.729
 and pretty I will explain the basic things that 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:13.939
 more or less here we have 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.059
 thrown into the air that goes in there goes 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.710
 afp from there 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.710
 everything in the afternoon in the mr 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.019
 also there the deposit of 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.150
 the suter 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.400
 will be built because I want a very small deposit and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.159
 and it adapts very well 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.749
 then you can get it moves the straight and the boundary and a lot of comfort 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.550
 and the deposit not only this but if it is here to attend the deposit you 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.780
 to make points nothing lower and the promo take discomfort from the curves 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.030
 1 also good as you can see 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.100
 all finishes are carbon nelson 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.140
 and also the swingarm is a joy 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 very important for madonna fashionistas 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.420
 tomorrow they will 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.860
 ban during a snowfall 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.730
 we go very little condemn I keep it graner plus the biggest one too 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.640
 they were from para 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.540
 to try to hold all the full force that the tire demands 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.190
 and for the camera we have 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.100
 these plates 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 in more safety issues in case you fall do not lose oil 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.380
 Iran expressed a motorcycle they finished very good too 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.300
 the chassis is one of the most important things because it is the only engine 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.120
 the chassis where you work plus a very well finished chassis with it 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.970
 the honduras by hand 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.210
 there they are very well made 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 we will die the front of the bike 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 we do not have the orgy the suspension 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.880
 use the same wave 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.130
 but we have to better 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.070
 but there's also the whole part of him 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.160
 from the brake disc to the pump which is a pretty large disc for 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.080
 to close as quickly as possible 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.679
 all the weight of the company's bike pretty 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.389
 for the final to aznar not sell less time 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.089
 the possible time 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.909
 all the bike and get better in the curve 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.109
 but we also have front tire that is a pretty romantic 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.230
 width of doing has said 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.790
 to see a little bit of agility of the bike but 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.959
 but also 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.949
 it gives you a little more flu 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:29.329
 love turned off whole face can keep mud 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.969
 the air act that is 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.579
 one of the things that many manufacturers also work for because it makes you 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:35.409
 win 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.849
 acro bullfighter ducks rate win this equino subway the rai that this tenth that 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.639
 but it counts a lot 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.209
 this is a part of the bike that is completely the same for all the engine 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.439
 is deaf and id 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.629
 and the clutch is a bounce mind of the brand its term manufacturer 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:59.079
 of chassis completely all motorcycles carry the same clemente rebound 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.339
 that in theory when they leave the clutch already works just go ask is it ask 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.379
 worry about if 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.769
 7 min the votes was too much understood as it competes 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:15.009
 the appointments what proved diomede I like quite a lot and to do is give a 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.949
 little the bike that is just enough to enter the curve 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.699
 then there is also a hundred 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.949
 there the exhaust that is important also to that the engine is identical 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:23.879
 for all 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.919
 and good escape control that 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.079
 what you like gives you gain speed is tenths of the straight 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.889
 the rear disc brake 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.749
 among others but tying the bomb as a disk 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.809
 It's much smaller than the front one gets used little, just go 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.409
 to have some braking 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.709
 and he could more 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.089
 and dialogue to 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.089
 the normative is normative enough to shock 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.899
 I do not know what was the best one adeba narrow canary enough to 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:57.159
 acceleration but bush is the same for all of the manufacturer 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.739
 he does not own it well we have to walk excellent fashion tuned further 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.859
 to work tires well 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.389
 we should not 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.019
 the screen 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.019
 that where the moment is respected the only information that I have 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.149
 of the motorbike 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.149
 and good that we have a little 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.900
 there I spent quite badly unemployed the green revolution of the motorbike 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.360
 MÃ©rida - January 9 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 in the middle class moved by navarra 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.709
 I do not have too few things there and the time per lap 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.830
 we also have marking the best time in this case samantha the best 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.110
 time for that 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.240
 in that round 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.370
 the laps you take will also be in that exit 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.020
 engine temperature 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.650
 the march that is ascending 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.639
 it is time that these lights if the engine goes very seriously it is understood 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.610
 washes 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.830
 appealed to the logical mind is cold was also discounted amounts turn on the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.059
 green light 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.620
 i called 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.669
 are things that jeter reflects a little bit not the information that in this 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.999
 on the bike of this model 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.559
 can not be configured in several ways but I have a little more barley 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:07.009
 simple
