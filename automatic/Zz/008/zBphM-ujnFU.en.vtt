and<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.590> know<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.980> couple<00:00:14.490> videos<00:00:14.730> back<00:00:14.940> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
and as you know a couple videos back I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.660 
and as you know a couple videos back I
did<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.590> didn't<00:00:17.010> quite<00:00:17.160> work<00:00:17.279> out

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
did this and it didn't quite work out

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.490 
did this and it didn't quite work out
the<00:00:17.730> way<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.029> wanted<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.810> theory<00:00:19.199> was

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the way I wanted to and my theory was

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.019 
the way I wanted to and my theory was
that<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.740> didn't<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.100> enough<00:00:20.220> snatch<00:00:20.699> blocks

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
that I didn't have enough snatch blocks

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.480 
that I didn't have enough snatch blocks
and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:22.170> tried<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.859> without<00:00:23.010> snatch

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and I tried to do it without snatch

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.070 
and I tried to do it without snatch
blocks<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.000> didn't<00:00:24.180> quite<00:00:24.269> work<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:24.900> hot

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
blocks it didn't quite work out so hot

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.240 
blocks it didn't quite work out so hot

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
alternative to winching backwards which

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.530 
alternative to winching backwards which
was<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> throw<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> winch<00:00:33.480> cable

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

another tree behind the Jeep now I'm
going<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.629> get<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.900> we'll<00:02:27.200> see<00:02:27.349> if<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.530> works

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.940 

now<00:03:00.420> let<00:03:00.690> me<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.260> explain<00:03:01.530> why<00:03:01.890> this

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
now let me see if I can explain why this

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.970 
now let me see if I can explain why this
works<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.760> simple<00:03:03.330> terms<00:03:03.709> now<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
works in simple terms now you have a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.350 
works in simple terms now you have a
Jeep<00:03:05.310> here<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.209> attach<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.780> winch<00:03:07.110> line<00:03:08.360> to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
Jeep here and you attach a winch line to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.100 
Jeep here and you attach a winch line to
a<00:03:09.390> tree<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.760> attach<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.269> loosely<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
a tree you just attach it loosely and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.900 
a tree you just attach it loosely and
you<00:03:13.470> start<00:03:13.709> winching<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.250> what's<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> first

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
you start winching in what's the first

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.640 
you start winching in what's the first
thing<00:03:15.150> that's<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.569> happen<00:03:15.750> well<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
thing that's going to happen well the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.229 
thing that's going to happen well the
first<00:03:16.890> thing<00:03:17.099> that's<00:03:17.250> going<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.519> happen<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
first thing that's going to happen is it

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.199 
first thing that's going to happen is it
takes<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.690> all<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.930> slack<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.790> that's<00:03:21.000> going

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
takes up all the slack so that's going

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.240 
takes up all the slack so that's going
to<00:03:21.269> straighten<00:03:21.660> everything<00:03:21.870> out<00:03:22.410> before<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
to straighten everything out before you

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.490 
to straighten everything out before you
start<00:03:23.519> moving<00:03:23.700> now<00:03:24.060> let's<00:03:25.019> look<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.349> this

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
start moving now let's look at this

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.280 
start moving now let's look at this
example<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:26.190> we<00:03:26.340> did<00:03:26.580> outside<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.989> first

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
example that we did outside the first

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.589 
example that we did outside the first
thing<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.950> do<00:03:29.190> again<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.000> take<00:03:30.420> up

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
thing it's going to do again is take up

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.420 
thing it's going to do again is take up
all<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.810> slack<00:03:31.230> now<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.769> know<00:03:32.130> what<00:03:32.280> you're

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
all the slack now I know what you're

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.589 
all the slack now I know what you're
thinking<00:03:32.790> you're<00:03:32.910> thinking<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.450> no

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
thinking you're thinking there is no

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.170 
thinking you're thinking there is no
slack<00:03:34.110> well<00:03:34.440> let's<00:03:35.220> look<00:03:35.370> at<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.700> again

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
slack well let's look at it again

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.110 
slack well let's look at it again
the<00:03:36.720> trees<00:03:37.110> are<00:03:37.620> stable<00:03:38.430> they're<00:03:38.610> not<00:03:38.760> moving

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
the trees are stable they're not moving

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.270 
the trees are stable they're not moving
anywhere<00:03:39.360> right<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> only<00:03:40.860> thing<00:03:41.250> that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
anywhere right so the only thing that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.500 
anywhere right so the only thing that
can<00:03:41.579> move<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.230> Jeep<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:45.150> do<00:03:45.299> actually

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
line now your winch is turning in but

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.039 
line now your winch is turning in but
just<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.910> turning<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.480> doesn't

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
just because it's turning in doesn't

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.780 
just because it's turning in doesn't
mean<00:04:13.139> it's<00:04:13.319> moving<00:04:13.650> forward<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.220> just

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
mean it's moving forward it's just

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.240 
mean it's moving forward it's just
pulling<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.239> slack<00:04:15.569> out<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.200> line<00:04:16.289> since

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
pulling the slack out of the line since

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.129 
pulling the slack out of the line since
you've<00:04:17.400> got<00:04:17.579> your<00:04:17.609> snatch<00:04:17.940> blocks<00:04:18.329> it's<00:04:18.840> just

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
you've got your snatch blocks it's just

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.620 
you've got your snatch blocks it's just
allowing<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.859> line<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.370> flow<00:04:20.609> freely<00:04:21.090> into

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
allowing that line to flow freely into

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.320 
allowing that line to flow freely into
the<00:04:21.750> winch<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.260> which<00:04:23.070> case<00:04:23.669> pulls<00:04:24.090> you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the winch in which case pulls you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.770 
the winch in which case pulls you
backwards<00:04:25.320> taking<00:04:25.710> out<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.919> slack<00:04:26.419> okay<00:04:27.419> guys
