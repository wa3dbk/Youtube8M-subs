00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
right now

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.090 
right now
ah<00:04:04.640> let's<00:04:05.640> try<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.880> again<00:04:06.829> we're<00:04:07.829> gonna<00:04:07.980> have

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
ah let's try that again we're gonna have

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.630 
ah let's try that again we're gonna have
to<00:04:08.280> take<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> run<00:04:09.209> off<00:04:09.390> um

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
to take a run off um

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.280 
to take a run off um
shrapnel<00:04:11.640> damage<00:04:12.000> stuff

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
shrapnel damage stuff

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.539 
shrapnel damage stuff
man<00:04:14.450> come<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.569> here<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.049> go<00:04:16.229> just<00:04:16.979> needed<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.370> bit

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
man come on here we go just needed a bit

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.039 
man come on here we go just needed a bit
of<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.699> jump<00:04:18.859> okay<00:04:19.859> let's<00:04:20.100> go<00:04:20.479> now<00:04:21.479> we<00:04:21.690> can<00:04:21.930> make

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
of a jump okay let's go now we can make

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.800 
of a jump okay let's go now we can make
it<00:04:22.109> okay<00:04:22.590> let's<00:04:22.860> go<00:04:23.009> backwards<00:04:23.449> fit<00:04:24.449> down<00:04:24.600> back

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
it okay let's go backwards fit down back

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.620 
it okay let's go backwards fit down back
we're<00:04:25.139> gonna<00:04:25.259> have<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.470> nice<00:04:25.800> long<00:04:26.100> run-up

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
we're gonna have a nice long run-up

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.749 
we're gonna have a nice long run-up
we're<00:04:27.630> gonna<00:04:27.780> jump<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.320> house<00:04:28.470> okay<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.430> let's

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
we're gonna jump the house okay so let's

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.379 
we're gonna jump the house okay so let's
go<00:04:30.169> there<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:31.289> go

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
go there we go

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.469 
go there we go
go<00:04:33.389> speed<00:04:33.660> ahead<00:04:34.110> right<00:04:34.770> up<00:04:34.949> there<00:04:35.820> we<00:04:36.030> go

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
go speed ahead right up there we go

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.420 
go speed ahead right up there we go
what's<00:04:36.690> on<00:04:36.840> top<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.169> this<00:04:37.320> holy<00:04:38.180> crap

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
what's on top of this holy crap

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.999 
what's on top of this holy crap
someone's<00:04:41.430> on<00:04:41.580> drugs<00:04:42.350> what<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.770> hell<00:04:43.979> is

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
someone's on drugs what the hell is

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.129 
someone's on drugs what the hell is
happening<00:04:44.310> here<00:04:44.910> what<00:04:45.449> happens<00:04:45.750> going<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.960> cut

happening here what happens going to cut

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.710 
happening here what happens going to cut
jumps<00:04:46.440> on<00:04:46.590> -<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.039> get<00:04:47.280> high<00:04:47.490> nope<00:04:48.330> it's

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
jumps on - this is get high nope it's

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.930 
jumps on - this is get high nope it's
just<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.729> weirdest<00:04:51.210> game<00:04:51.419> ever<00:04:51.740> um<00:04:52.940> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
just just the weirdest game ever um the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.240 
just just the weirdest game ever um the
skybox<00:04:54.449> is<00:04:54.599> just<00:04:54.840> having<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.259> feel<00:04:55.800> there<00:04:56.039> right

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
skybox is just having a feel there right

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.920 
skybox is just having a feel there right
now<00:04:56.539> why<00:04:57.539> are<00:04:57.599> your<00:04:57.930> speaker<00:04:58.380> systems<00:04:58.770> outside

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
now why are your speaker systems outside

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.390 
now why are your speaker systems outside
this<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.139> garage<00:05:01.349> sale<00:05:01.770> or<00:05:01.860> something<00:05:01.979> I

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
this is a garage sale or something I

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.249 
this is a garage sale or something I
have<00:05:02.550> no<00:05:02.940> clue<00:05:03.210> what's<00:05:03.449> happening<00:05:03.570> here<00:05:04.080> but

so yeah that's cool um what else can we
see<00:05:12.419> this<00:05:12.599> weird<00:05:12.930> weird<00:05:13.259> world<00:05:14.389> huh<00:05:16.639> maybe

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
see this weird weird world huh maybe

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.379 
see this weird weird world huh maybe
yeah

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
yeah

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.870 
yeah
there<00:05:18.780> isn't<00:05:18.990> anything<00:05:19.289> else<00:05:19.530> let's<00:05:20.490> let's

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
there isn't anything else let's let's

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.360 
there isn't anything else let's let's
keep<00:05:21.030> walking<00:05:21.479> straight<00:05:21.630> ahead<00:05:21.990> if<00:05:22.620> not

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
keep walking straight ahead if not

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.040 
keep walking straight ahead if not
anything<00:05:23.699> else<00:05:23.970> then<00:05:24.330> hopefully<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:24.900> can

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
anything else then hopefully you can

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.210 
anything else then hopefully you can
fall<00:05:25.289> off<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.530> edge<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> world<00:05:26.039> wait

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
fall off the edge of the world wait

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.969 
fall off the edge of the world wait
there's<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.520> road<00:05:26.760> here<00:05:27.120> okay<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.740> world

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
there's a road here okay so this world

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.950 
there's a road here okay so this world
is<00:05:29.159> actually<00:05:29.610> big<00:05:29.820> just<00:05:30.479> let<00:05:30.659> it<00:05:30.750> draw

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
is actually big just let it draw

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.460 
is actually big just let it draw
distance<00:05:31.349> is<00:05:31.470> really<00:05:31.860> shallow<00:05:33.409> there's<00:05:34.409> a

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
distance is really shallow there's a

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.370 
distance is really shallow there's a
wall<00:05:34.770> there<00:05:34.800> is<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.610> big<00:05:36.090> invisible<00:05:36.780> wall<00:05:37.020> it

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
wall there is a big invisible wall it

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.980 
wall there is a big invisible wall it
looks<00:05:37.560> like<00:05:37.770> one<00:05:37.949> of<00:05:37.979> those<00:05:38.130> magic<00:05:38.430> eye

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
looks like one of those magic eye

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.899 
looks like one of those magic eye
drawing<00:05:39.990> some<00:05:40.380> wonder<00:05:40.590> if<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:40.919> though<00:05:41.159> hmm

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
drawing some wonder if it is though hmm

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.200 
drawing some wonder if it is though hmm
what<00:05:42.720> does<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.020> look<00:05:43.229> like<00:05:43.699> nope<00:05:44.699> it's<00:05:45.060> just

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
what does it look like nope it's just

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.219 
what does it look like nope it's just
the<00:05:45.599> thing<00:05:45.840> it's<00:05:46.380> just<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.740> we're<00:05:46.949> looking<00:05:47.280> whoa

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
the thing it's just a we're looking whoa

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.379 
the thing it's just a we're looking whoa
okay<00:05:49.260> um<00:05:49.979> let's<00:05:50.550> see<00:05:50.639> if<00:05:50.760> we<00:05:50.820> can<00:05:50.970> fold<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
okay um let's see if we can fold the

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.409 
okay um let's see if we can fold the
edge<00:05:51.570> of<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:51.870> then<00:05:52.610> hope<00:05:53.610> it<00:05:53.760> doesn't<00:05:53.880> continue

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
edge of it then hope it doesn't continue

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.260 
edge of it then hope it doesn't continue
forever<00:05:54.630> but<00:05:55.560> yeah<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.250> or<00:05:56.880> this<00:05:57.060> has
