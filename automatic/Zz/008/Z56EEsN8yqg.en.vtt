I'm<00:00:00.210> coupe<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.780> my<00:00:00.900> modified<00:00:01.319> rapid

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
I'm coupe this is my modified rapid

firing<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.280> I've<00:00:08.400> done<00:00:08.519> all<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.700> these<00:00:08.880> interim

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
firing so I've done all of these interim

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
firing so I've done all of these interim
ons<00:00:09.389> before<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> actually<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
ons before and I actually have a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.839 
ons before and I actually have a
tutorial<00:00:10.679> covering<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.280> them<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.730> took

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
tutorial covering all of them so I took

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.669 
tutorial covering all of them so I took
out<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.269> resistors<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> thermistor<00:00:13.590> up

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
out the resistors in the thermistor up

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.440 
out the resistors in the thermistor up
in<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.860> motor<00:00:13.980> unit<00:00:14.250> rewired<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.880> entirely

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
in the motor unit rewired it entirely

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.240 
in the motor unit rewired it entirely
and<00:00:15.839> remove<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.440> electronic<00:00:16.949> lock<00:00:17.100> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
and remove the electronic lock that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.740 
and remove the electronic lock that
deactivates<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.820> flywheels<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
deactivates the flywheels if the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.630 
deactivates the flywheels if the
magazine<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.350> inserted<00:00:19.590> besides<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
magazine is not inserted besides that I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.920 
magazine is not inserted besides that I
didn't<00:00:20.880> actually<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.359> do<00:00:21.449> much<00:00:21.630> else<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
didn't actually have to do much else to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.660 
didn't actually have to do much else to
the<00:00:22.020> circuit<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.410> did<00:00:22.560> remove<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the circuit I did remove some of the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.769 
the circuit I did remove some of the
moving<00:00:23.880> parts<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.359> including<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
moving parts up here including the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.000 
moving parts up here including the
access<00:00:25.080> door<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.289> everything's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> little<00:00:25.830> bit

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
access door so everything's a little bit

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.740 
access door so everything's a little bit
smoother<00:00:26.340> than<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.609> stock<00:00:26.849> form<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.480> also

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
smoother than in stock form and I also

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.019 
smoother than in stock form and I also
rewired<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> four<00:00:29.130> double-a<00:00:29.609> harness

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
rewired it to a four double-a harness

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
rewired it to a four double-a harness
this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.109> stock<00:00:31.349> tray<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> does

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.479 
ultra fires in a rapid strike the stock
motors<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:42.870> fry<00:00:43.170> three<00:00:43.710> ultra<00:00:43.950> fires<00:00:44.190> I've

already<00:00:44.940> found<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> overdoing<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
already found is kind of overdoing it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.680 
already found is kind of overdoing it
over<00:00:47.160> extended<00:00:47.760> amount<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> time<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> hold

over extended amount of time if you hold

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
over extended amount of time if you hold
down<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.930> red<00:00:49.079> trigger<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> long<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:49.860> motors

down that red trigger a long time motors
do<00:00:50.760> give<00:00:51.030> off<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> nasty<00:00:51.510> scent<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> am

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
do give off a nasty scent and I am

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
do give off a nasty scent and I am
worried<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.500> long-term<00:00:52.890> effects<00:00:53.550> but

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
worried about long-term effects but

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
worried about long-term effects but
still<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.120> heavier<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> performance<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
still very heavier the performance on

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
still very heavier the performance on
the<00:00:55.739> rapid<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.219> even<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> ultra<00:00:56.910> fires

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the rapid right even on to ultra fires

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.250 
the rapid right even on to ultra fires
it<00:00:57.329> still<00:00:57.510> shoots<00:00:57.690> better<00:00:57.809> than<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> stock

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it still shoots better than the stock

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.330 
it still shoots better than the stock
very<00:00:58.559> happy<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> internal

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
very happy with the internal

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.380 
very happy with the internal
modifications<00:00:59.879> everything<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.210> pretty

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
modifications everything is pretty

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.700 
modifications everything is pretty
smooth<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.690> I've<00:01:00.809> done<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> few<00:01:01.170> rapid<00:01:01.469> strikes

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
smooth as I've done a few rapid strikes

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
smooth as I've done a few rapid strikes
now<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.219> pretty<00:01:02.370> quick<00:01:02.609> at<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> know

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
now so I'm pretty quick at it and I know

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.280 
now so I'm pretty quick at it and I know
everything<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> work<00:01:04.019> pretty

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
everything is going to work pretty

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.850 
everything is going to work pretty
easily

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
easily
