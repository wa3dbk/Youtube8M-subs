00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
time I brought with me today some liquid

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.900 
time I brought with me today some liquid
nitrogen<00:00:10.320> ah<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> your<00:00:11.099> favorites<00:00:11.639> isn't

it it is my favorite okay the cool thing

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.919 
it it is my favorite okay the cool thing
about<00:00:14.009> liquid<00:00:14.400> nitrogen<00:00:14.670> literally<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
about liquid nitrogen literally is that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.189 
about liquid nitrogen literally is that
it's<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.170> very<00:00:16.619> cold<00:00:17.750> yeah<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.810> should<00:00:19.109> not

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
it's very very cold yeah you should not

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.630 
it's very very cold yeah you should not
be<00:00:19.260> touching<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:19.980> your<00:00:20.130> bare<00:00:20.250> hands<00:00:20.460> look

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
be touching it with your bare hands look

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.769 
be touching it with your bare hands look
Mac<00:00:20.820> we're<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.180> gonna<00:00:21.300> touch<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.689> our

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Mac we're not gonna touch it with our

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
Mac we're not gonna touch it with our
bare<00:00:21.869> hands<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:23.039> neat<00:00:23.220> thing<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
bare hands but the neat thing about it

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.420 
bare hands but the neat thing about it
is<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.029> 320<00:00:25.019> degrees<00:00:25.109> below<00:00:25.470> zero<00:00:25.830> how<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
is it's 320 degrees below zero how and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609 
is it's 320 degrees below zero how and
even<00:00:26.939> though<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.180> 320<00:00:27.930> degrees<00:00:27.990> below<00:00:28.320> zero

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
even though it's 320 degrees below zero

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410 
even though it's 320 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit<00:00:29.070> what's<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> doing<00:00:30.000> inside<00:00:30.210> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
Fahrenheit what's it doing inside that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.930 
Fahrenheit what's it doing inside that
beaker<00:00:30.689> boiling<00:00:31.320> exactly<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.309> boiling<00:00:32.489> yeah

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
beaker boiling exactly it's boiling yeah

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
beaker boiling exactly it's boiling yeah
right<00:00:33.210> boiling<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.260> changing<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.280> liquid

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
right boiling is changing from a liquid

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.830 
right boiling is changing from a liquid
to<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.730> gas<00:00:35.790> most<00:00:36.300> people<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to a gas most people think that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
to a gas most people think that
something's<00:00:37.200> boiling<00:00:37.500> has<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.129> very<00:00:38.250> very

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
something's boiling has to be very very

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
something's boiling has to be very very
hot<00:00:38.760> sure<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> case<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.440> just

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
hot sure it's not the case it's just

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
hot sure it's not the case it's just
changing<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.160> liquid<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.550> gas<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:42.000> fact

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
changing from a liquid to a gas in fact

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.700 
changing from a liquid to a gas in fact
you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.870> something<00:00:43.140> pretty<00:00:43.290> cool<00:00:43.350> with

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you can do something pretty cool with

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.529 
you can do something pretty cool with
that<00:00:43.860> fact<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.579> boiling<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.300> okay

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that fact that it's boiling and okay

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.440 
that fact that it's boiling and okay
greeting<00:00:46.050> gas<00:00:46.550> because<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> liquid<00:00:48.120> nitrogen

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
greeting gas because the liquid nitrogen

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.840 
greeting gas because the liquid nitrogen
is<00:00:48.660> obviously<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.110> liquid<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.640> take

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is obviously just liquid but if we take

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
is obviously just liquid but if we take
some<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> nitrogen<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
some of that nitrogen and put it in a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.549 
some of that nitrogen and put it in a
test<00:00:52.829> tube<00:00:52.890> uh-huh<00:00:53.219> okay<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.870> can't<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
test tube uh-huh okay you can't see the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
test tube uh-huh okay you can't see the
gas<00:00:55.770> coming<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.000> invisible

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
gas coming off because it's invisible

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
gas coming off because it's invisible
but<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> balloon<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.620> top<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:59.520> should<00:00:59.699> be

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
but I put a balloon on top we should be

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.689 
but I put a balloon on top we should be
able<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.210> ah<00:01:00.449> look<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.710> start<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> inflate<00:01:02.309> okay

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
able to ah look on start to inflate okay

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
able to ah look on start to inflate okay
now<00:01:03.059> cool<00:01:03.899> thing<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:04.979> get

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
now cool thing is I want to really get

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.550 
now cool thing is I want to really get
this<00:01:05.250> entire<00:01:05.580> balloon<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.180> inflate<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this entire balloon to inflate all the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320 
this entire balloon to inflate all the
way<00:01:07.680> probably<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.729> time<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.150> wait<00:01:09.299> for

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
way probably don't have time to wait for

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.670 
way probably don't have time to wait for
that<00:01:09.600> certainly<00:01:09.930> now<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.290> gonna<00:01:10.470> dump

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that certainly now I'm just gonna dump

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
that certainly now I'm just gonna dump
all<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> nitrogen<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> wants<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> sort<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
all the nitrogen and it wants to sort of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.230 
all the nitrogen and it wants to sort of
speed<00:01:12.479> things<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:13.159> okay<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> cap<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:14.970> off

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
speed things up okay so to cap it off

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
speed things up okay so to cap it off
okay<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> nitrogen<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> expands<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
okay and nitrogen when it expands from a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
okay and nitrogen when it expands from a
liquid<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> gas<00:01:18.060> takes<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.720> eight

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
liquid to a gas takes up about eight

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.280 
liquid to a gas takes up about eight
hundred<00:01:19.290> times<00:01:19.799> more<00:01:20.130> volume<00:01:20.759> oh<00:01:21.030> wow<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.170> this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
hundred times more volume oh wow so this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
hundred times more volume oh wow so this
balloon<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> pop<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:24.000> probably

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
balloon it's going to pop it's probably

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
balloon it's going to pop it's probably
gonna<00:01:24.420> pop<00:01:24.659> once<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> gets<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.890> big

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
gonna pop once it gets really really big

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
gonna pop once it gets really really big
in<00:01:26.280> fact<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> nitrogen<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.240> freezing<00:01:27.780> part<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
in fact the nitrogen is freezing part of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.060 
in fact the nitrogen is freezing part of
the<00:01:28.110> balloon<00:01:28.350> oh<00:01:28.500> wow<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.920> very

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the balloon oh wow it's very very

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.530 
the balloon oh wow it's very very
brittle<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.610> some<00:01:32.729> point<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.180> break

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
brittle and at some point it will break

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.539 
brittle and at some point it will break
okay<00:01:33.900> um<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> interesting

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
okay um and so it's kind of interesting

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.800 
okay um and so it's kind of interesting
to<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.060> happens<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.509> different

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to see what happens with different

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.179 
to see what happens with different
materials<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:37.920> cold

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
materials when they get very very cold

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
materials when they get very very cold
sure<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.810> ahead<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:39.990> hold

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
sure so if you can go ahead and hold

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
sure so if you can go ahead and hold
this<00:01:40.560> okay<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.430> okay<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.210> you're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this okay like that okay and you're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
this okay like that okay and you're
gonna<00:01:42.420> dip<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:43.259> into<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.680> container

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
gonna dip it right into the container

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
gonna dip it right into the container
middle<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.060> portion<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.780> no<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.200> it's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
middle do you portion here no way it's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
middle do you portion here no way it's
just<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:46.890> vinyl<00:01:47.100> tubing<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.640> medical

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
just some vinyl tubing like medical

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
just some vinyl tubing like medical
tubing<00:01:48.180> perfect<00:01:49.079> yeah<00:01:49.320> well<00:01:49.890> let's<00:01:50.130> count

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
tubing perfect yeah well let's count

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.090 
tubing perfect yeah well let's count
three<00:01:50.939> two<00:01:51.409> one<00:01:52.409> go<00:01:52.619> ahead<00:01:52.740> take<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
three two one go ahead take it out and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
three two one go ahead take it out and
stretch<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.430> far<00:01:53.880> apart<00:01:54.149> oh<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.500> gonna

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
stretch it far apart oh it's not gonna

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
stretch it far apart oh it's not gonna
break<00:01:55.829> no<00:01:56.040> big<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.210> put<00:01:57.360> my<00:01:57.390> hand<00:01:57.689> on

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
break no big but if I put my hand on

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
break no big but if I put my hand on
here<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> warm<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.740> it'll<00:01:58.920> become

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
here I can warm it up and it'll become

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
here I can warm it up and it'll become
much<00:01:59.430> bad<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.270> lot<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.600> people<00:02:00.689> would<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.290> or

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
much bad a lot of people would think or

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
much bad a lot of people would think or
want<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> say<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.610> freezing<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> yeah

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
want to say that you're freezing it yeah

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.969 
want to say that you're freezing it yeah
really<00:02:03.869> freezing<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.439> we're<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.560> making<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
really freezing it we're just making it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.800 
really freezing it we're just making it
more<00:02:05.009> brittle<00:02:05.520> okay<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.420> different

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
more brittle okay but different

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.089 
more brittle okay but different
materials<00:02:07.229> behave<00:02:07.350> differently<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
materials behave differently this one is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.320 
materials behave differently this one is
gonna<00:02:08.190> warm<00:02:08.459> back<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.119> real

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
gonna warm back up and get real

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.740 
gonna warm back up and get real
stretching<00:02:09.690> okay<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.440> not

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
stretching okay so it's not

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750 
stretching okay so it's not
it's<00:02:11.200> not<00:02:11.290> going<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.530> break<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.430> vinyl

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
it's not going to break but this vinyl

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's not going to break but this vinyl
tubing<00:02:13.030> behaves<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.540> little<00:02:13.810> bit<00:02:13.930> differently

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
tubing behaves a little bit differently

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.780 
tubing behaves a little bit differently
so<00:02:15.070> I'm<00:02:15.160> gonna<00:02:15.250> do<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.430> I'm<00:02:15.460> going<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.640> cool

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so I'm gonna do is I'm going to cool

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.010 
so I'm gonna do is I'm going to cool
this<00:02:15.940> down<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> few<00:02:16.420> seconds<00:02:16.690> if<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.840> can

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
this down for a few seconds if you can

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.050 
this down for a few seconds if you can
take<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.230> hammer<00:02:18.010> there<00:02:18.430> mm-hmm<00:02:18.910> we're

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
take that hammer there mm-hmm we're

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.520 
take that hammer there mm-hmm we're
gonna<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.360> what<00:02:19.390> happens<00:02:19.810> if<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.020> apply<00:02:20.500> a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
gonna see what happens if we apply a

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.590 
gonna see what happens if we apply a
little<00:02:20.800> force<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.580> sort<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.970> material

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
little force to this sort of material

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.480 
little force to this sort of material
okay<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.170> what<00:02:23.290> happens<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.130> go<00:02:24.280> ahead<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
okay see what happens so go ahead and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.920 
okay see what happens so go ahead and
give<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:24.820> tap<00:02:25.000> right<00:02:25.630> in<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.780> milk

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
give it a little tap right in the milk

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.670 
give it a little tap right in the milk
oh<00:02:27.510> wow<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.750> figured<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
oh wow I figured that that was going to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.960 
oh wow I figured that that was going to
happen<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> turn<00:02:30.430> right<00:02:30.459> into<00:02:30.790> almost

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
happen it's a turn right into almost

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.810 
happen it's a turn right into almost
glad<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.570> one<00:02:31.720> shatters<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.290> glass<00:02:32.350> Wow

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
glad this one shatters like glass Wow

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.490 
glad this one shatters like glass Wow
latex<00:02:33.820> versus<00:02:34.240> vinyl<00:02:34.630> very<00:02:34.870> different<00:02:35.230> in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
latex versus vinyl very different in

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.680 
latex versus vinyl very different in
fact<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.890> racquetball<00:02:36.280> which<00:02:37.030> normally<00:02:37.510> would

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
fact a racquetball which normally would

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.020 
fact a racquetball which normally would
be<00:02:37.810> very<00:02:38.500> bouncy<00:02:38.770> sure<00:02:39.130> put<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.820> in<00:02:39.940> liquid

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
be very bouncy sure put it in liquid

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.320 
be very bouncy sure put it in liquid
nitrogen<00:02:40.180> cool<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> down<00:02:40.840> oh<00:02:41.220> wow<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.820> had<00:02:42.940> it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
nitrogen cool it down oh wow you had it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.650 
nitrogen cool it down oh wow you had it
will<00:02:43.480> shatter<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:44.320> glass<00:02:44.700> huh<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.180> some

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
will shatter like glass huh so some

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
will shatter like glass huh so some
really<00:02:46.810> interesting<00:02:46.989> material<00:02:47.739> science<00:02:48.070> that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
really interesting material science that

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.199 
really interesting material science that
you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.520> when<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.880> something

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
you can do when you have something

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.310 
you can do when you have something
available<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.959> allows<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.290> to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
available like this that allows you to

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.420 
available like this that allows you to
cool<00:02:50.530> things<00:02:50.560> down<00:02:50.860> from<00:02:51.160> room<00:02:51.280> temperature

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
cool things down from room temperature

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.180 
cool things down from room temperature
to<00:02:51.810> 320<00:02:52.810> degrees<00:02:52.900> below<00:02:53.200> zero<00:02:53.470> interesting<00:02:54.040> so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
to 320 degrees below zero interesting so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.530 
to 320 degrees below zero interesting so
it's<00:02:54.340> all<00:02:54.459> about<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> material<00:02:55.330> then

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
it's all about the material then

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.330 
it's all about the material then
different<00:02:56.380> materials<00:02:56.709> behave<00:02:56.860> differently

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
different materials behave differently

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.640 
different materials behave differently
the<00:02:57.880> classic<00:02:58.270> demonstration<00:02:58.420> are<00:02:58.930> flowers<00:02:59.410> if

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
