 The spring is built in but this is stainless steel The material is stainless steel 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.790
 This common mast I'd 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.410
 It is said that it does not develop heat discoloration 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.420
 Blue King mjn coating has been applied 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.930
 It is all this coating It is this 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.480
 Light blue 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.810
 It is a beautiful Hizen beautiful blue with a sense of transparency, but the characteristic of this is that it doesn't heat discoloring 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.989
 is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.790
 With conventional normal stainless steel, it is slightly discolored and browned and looks a little 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.630
 I'm not so beautiful 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.520
 Here there is no such a thing and all the way this Bruno rain 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.880

 It is why aluminum heat guard this Watsuku Damon 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.240
 Will be posted 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.860
 I think that I can convey the appearance quite sharply and produce 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.590
 And it is the output characteristic 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.420
 Goodness of standard 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:48.040
 It exceeds the normal beautifully in the whole area without loss 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.110
 I heard that I got the output characteristics and Nakano this glass wool is also special 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.750
 It is very durable using things 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.280
 It means to last long 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.500
 mac mrd I tried to put on this slip and actually tried it 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.920
 a 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:06.140
 8 That's right I feel wet 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.330
 Mode liner exchange high Teru is the sound that I like a little muffled but it is reverse 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.650
 It's nice to have a nice little piece 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:16.930
 So the high heaven after noise not a good 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.549
 It was kind to the ears so I thought it would be snowing not to get tired even if I was riding for quite a long time 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:25.500
 It is mounting It is also very easy here. 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:29.580
 Well it's the operator of pawn But I'm is not also by the difficult 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:34.940
 It becomes a form to catch with this silencer band 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.860
 After hanging with this and silencer band, this stay part 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.009
 Say it can be fine tuned 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:46.710
 Because it is the feeling Well Well 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:52.969
 I think that it can be easily done by anyone if it takes 30 minutes until removal and removal of the pump . 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.440
 It's a heavy story, but with a standard of 2.8 kg this is true 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:05:00.390
 I think it feels about half 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.890
 If it says with the rod of such a thin silencer, the material will be titanium other than that 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.890
 I think it is finished lightweight 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.729
 Here of course it is the first of jmca accredited government certification so you can enjoy traveling on public roads 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.070
 I think 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.529
 As a standard for this kind of replacement muffler 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.589

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.589
