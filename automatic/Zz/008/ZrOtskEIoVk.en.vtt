 spend and just one day 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.630
 in life but I think it also 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.460
 really super important at the moment 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.970
 to think in the future and money 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.710
 To give her back to her mother 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.780

 Managing Director standing next to us 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.649
 But a few tries now 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.870
 should it succeed then? 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.280
 yes and there I am looking forward david fischer 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.170
 how do you know now? 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.640
 two three weeks there you have one 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.649
 a bit acclimatised to Zurich 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.719
 arrived yes first hello lars 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.370
 Sorry that it is not right on 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.070
 first day worked but the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.120
 Handover was a bit more extensive 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.250
 definitely acclimatizes 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.740
 that must be said was never really 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.570
 away from offenbach and that with 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.880
 Herbert Grönemeyer was never really gone 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.350
 yes, always remained faithful 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.610
 here was a flat in offenbach 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.040
 you have to say that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 and currently just under two weeks here 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 acclimatizes very fast task field 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 of course we had it very extensive 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.360
 but now some points on the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.710
 agenda we directly with 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.060
 had to start working, of course 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.820
 with the wonderful success against union 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.970
 berlin as the end of the paintings 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.290
 Of course, it was a very charming one 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.450
 entry and then of course, of course 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.830
 clearly the hessenderby against darmstadt that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.150
 I'm against Rostock and such 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.370
 then pass very quickly two 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.390
 and on the other hand, yes, too 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.870
 so a little the task field 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.250
 On the other hand, you know the ofc 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.350
 And as I said on the other hand, it was like that 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.710
 that you get more out of the marketing at home 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.370
 was 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.530
 now soy is on the whole an overview 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.480
 how necessary is that for you? 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.520
 selected until that is pretty good 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.160
 come in or it's still a lot 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.300
 what is so pouncing on you now so 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.670
 I'm coming, of course, belongs to the class 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.660
 from the marketing sponsoring acquisition 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.760
 and care 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.250
 Of course, this is also part of this 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.450
 commercial management but im 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.400
 big, of course, straight 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.110
 paying factory I am a human paid if 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.700
 formerly also for sports with even the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.340
 billing here or at others 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.849
 locations also made 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.860
 generally also a commercial one 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.850
 Training diploma sports manager and I am 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.830
 accordingly with the whole 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720
 Zahlenwerk is familiar or is 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.020
 a bit too my little one 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.850
 suffering 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.220
 creates and that comes naturally 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.710
 and also requires all areas in the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.960
 end effect but had to pay the people 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.490
 but then not in which one 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.230
 accounting but what the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.700
 overall overview or the or 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.030
 also made operational accounting 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.500
 With 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.220
 In the end it is like that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.110
 Of course, the overview and the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.490
 accounting must have and of course with 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.590
 So even a balance sheet can read that 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.000
 already a basic requirement there as well 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.040
 to be able to work in the future 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.860
 in itself a bookkeeper here in the house 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.170
 support nor the tax advice 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.050
 tooth after tooth from our treasurer 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.640
 which energetically supports us so that 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.440
 stop this task of course 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.120
 But I'm being looked at surgically 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.070
 stop by the wife maria riesch at 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.050
 Of course we do the accounting 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.890
 is mastered and has one belonged to that 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.810
 should now a bit like that 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.580
 give changes that should support 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.430
 is it true that it is just like that 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.050
 Mrs Mathew has and new task 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.870
 dedicates or dedicates itself to these 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.490
 from the first first examination grad 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.020
 tax consultant respectively 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.960
 tax consultants like to apply 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.210
 we go only until next year 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.680
 and therefore there is simply an end effect 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.270
 and exchange and then we want us 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.620
 but also structurally in general 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.570
 set the topic a little differently 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.880
 Controlling is because the parent of that we 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.770
 because not a classic job 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.480
 but new tasks simply with the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.040
 one way or another enter a 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.080
 way too transparent for us too 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.450
 be internally and just hold the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.350
 bodies against certain 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.630
 information obligations to comply easily 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.040
 the jörg am welcomed he came from so too 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.230
 the numbers but on the other 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.600
 also sometime until the end 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.400
 then when it became necessary a lot like this 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.160
 little marketing initiated 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.540
 is been already well passed 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.640
 Do you already have the overview? 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.890
 So my potential very clearly too 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.750
 follow the action went yes 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.430
 and of course with this 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.140
 management position also conditionally 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.430
 that the subject of marketing is under the 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.470
 Fittiche field and there we will 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.640
 of course also in perspective 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.470
 put something in the past 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.150
 she was partly done that 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 Add one or the other new ones with 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.900
 grad next week we have it like this 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.580
 called kick ass connect such a 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.290
 similar event as the kickers 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.419
 club meet only a little broader 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.160
 just make new business the way to 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.220
 Bieberer mountain easy to pave around 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.750
 simply because more partners to win 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.160
 interest too simply to foment it 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.850
 we also continue the basis here 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.740
 widen 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.490
 there are the biggest ones for you now 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.560
 challenges 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.599
 I am now next to this 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.770
 now dedicate very intense so final 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.210
 final again, too 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.130
 complete the overview of the finances 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.380
 So we have or are just laying 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.120
 a change of system and are there 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.280
 just look okay what water man 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.990
 old loads how can we plan how 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.580
 In general, the planning for 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.900
 the next months and years out 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.680
 just there a better feeling yet 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.720
 to get it for or 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.060
 better insight and then of course 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.410
 in perspective that was just the stone 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.030
 make again pilgrim site that 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.810
 Often, of course , often requires the classic 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.699
 athletic success 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.949
 You have to say they are very good 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.240
 away for a course in the dfb cup 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.430
 but also in the league have begun 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.259
 after the first four play there so that 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.870
 really good work has made 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.120
 now I had one side 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.409
 already in the marketing here at the OF had 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.120
 but that's never really true 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.130
 publicly appeared in the appearance 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.449
 of course that brings new job like that 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.800
 with that too publicly in 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.050
 Apparence therefore also occurs as 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.000
 little interview for you not so 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.590
 really know who you are exactly what 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.900
 Turns you off, where are you from? 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.330
 So was one I come from Saxony 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.099
 a contracted 8 20 years old, so to speak 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.639
 what makes me so i am 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.780
 certainly a very meticulous worker 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.639
 put much value on trust 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.070
 or even communication 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.469
 in small circles degree old also 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.940
 Of course many things are clear 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.380
 operational concerns with the 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.880
 experience values the individual 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.289
 Employees here already have easy 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.460
 Also, talk once too 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.860
 to take suggestions for improvement 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.460
 otherwise of course very dynamic 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.500
 complete with dynamic good cue 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.659
 definitely so in the end that was there 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.219
 of course with the leadership here that 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.069
 he shared the success of the 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:17.419
 fcn but when I say there will dynamically 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.849
 I would rather know exactly if you 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.409
 not ofc fans would be by profession 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.509
 then you would have something too 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.520
 dynamic still to offer yes due 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.280
 Of course, my origin is like that 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.580
 I was facing dynamo dresden 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.259
 in the past until 18 19 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.479
 there certainly a new one 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.219
 players have visited but now due 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.440
 fast and four years to three and a half 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.870
 years Offenbach beats the heart red 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.180
 knows how it's always called so nice 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.340
 here man is infected by the fc 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.259
 fever and body and soul 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.469
 ok then thank you , too 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.469
 Thank you
