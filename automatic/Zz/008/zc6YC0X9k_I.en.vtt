00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 every time I have to go back to this theme 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 unfortunately a simple message in the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.139
 facebook motivated the anger of a promoter of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.690
 justice in empress in maranhão and 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.179
 many Maranans became angry 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 with a simple comment as if all 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.630
 the other problems in the world were 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 solved the problem today is what the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 people write comment was the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.470
 Next Christmas isabela cardoso that I 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.970
 I do not even know it 's supposed to be a gaucho 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.980
 finally at home after one year and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 seven months in Suzano Empress and I 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 my husband is returning in the city state 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 poor the Maranhão culture is horrible 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 carnival trash tal de bumba my ox 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 creole drum 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 most women are the periguete 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260
 men more than half of the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 people are semi-literate 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.450
 anyway it was her criticism and she has 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.410
 All right to speak what she does well 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 understand 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 she posted on facebook she does not violate 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.870
 terms of use facebook she's free 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.469
 to talk what she likes 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.300
 So I kept thinking good people are 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.340
 bothered by the comment I had 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.049
 I'm exactly bothered. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.770
 let's start with the state part 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.330
 poor enough a simple search there you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.500
 can pick up the staff you will see that the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 per capita income from maranhão is $ 161 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.530
 the poorest state in the world. 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 Brazil is the one that wins the least has the lowest 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
 per capita income 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.479
 you can prove in this matter and the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.640
 Maranhão has the worst income 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.970
 Household per capita in the country according to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.189
 ibge is if you go to the question of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.170
 illiteracy is also one of the last 19 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.070
 percent of the population of maranhão 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.259
 illiterate right 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.200
 see this matter northeast concentrates 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.000
 more than half of the country's illiterate 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 the worst states were the maranhão o piauí 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.350
 it's alagoas 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 so people and this is serious because it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.960
 imagine if the northeast has practically 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.939
 a quarter of the country's population 50 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.020
 million and forty-few million 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:07.290
 has more than half the population 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:09.539
 illiterate so many people are here 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.000
 in matter also speaks of illiteracy 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.710
 functional is 30 million people 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.960
 who know how to write or 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.140
 has nothing can not understand 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.510
 mathematical operations do not 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.040
 even has the promoter who was 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 and said he will investigate and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.940
 to process is this tal de joaquim ribeiro 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.790
 subject has a 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.120
 remuneration of 27 thousand and five hundred reais 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.020
 and gross illusions 20 thousand more than 20 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.600
 one thousand reais 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.090
 all this from your money to be 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.280
 fiscal facebook and I was curious 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.100
 then whether the issue of poverty 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.960
 illiteracy sound fact bargain so 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.660
 who was annoyed by the comment 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.510
 was annoyed because troubled with the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.250
 fact that he criticized the culture and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 called men of rascal women of 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.570
 so if you are more 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.340
 concerned with the culture and with 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.360
 an opinion than with the fact that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.310
 poor illiterate this explains quite a 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.350
 condition that you are and probably 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.970
 You will not get away from this as long as you have 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.250
 this mentality 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.020
 remembering only the following is not the state 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.300
 that will reduce poverty in the state is 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.300
 cause of poverty so if you want to leave 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.890
 poverty and stop being illiterate 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.470
 defends the free market to defend 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.870
 individual freedom and effort 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.800
 individual only so you will improve the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.990
 situation 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.550
 Who do you think the state will solve? 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.090
 something will be waiting for you 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.090
 rest of life
