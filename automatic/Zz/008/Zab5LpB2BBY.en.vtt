of the big little film shot in Michigan
it's<00:02:43.440> uh<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:44.120> quite<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> story<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.989> again<00:02:46.110> for

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
it's uh it's quite a story but again for

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.930 
it's uh it's quite a story but again for
me<00:02:47.030> it's<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.980> combination<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
me it's it's the combination of the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.790 
me it's it's the combination of the
personal<00:02:51.420> drama<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.900> goes<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.260> within<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
personal drama that goes on within the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.850 
personal drama that goes on within the
family<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.630> larger<00:02:55.080> metaphor<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
family and the larger metaphor for a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.550 
family and the larger metaphor for a
house<00:02:56.040> divided<00:02:56.550> against<00:02:56.790> itself<00:02:57.560> coming
