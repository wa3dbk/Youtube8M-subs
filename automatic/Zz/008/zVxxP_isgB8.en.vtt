don't<00:00:30.210> know<00:00:30.539> what<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.019> happened<00:00:31.380> if

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
don't know what would have happened if

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220 
don't know what would have happened if
optic<00:00:32.279> would<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.550> won<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> SB<00:00:33.960> would<00:00:34.140> have

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
search they got some search came to work

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.150 
search they got some search came to work
on<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:01.140> lost<00:01:01.350> both<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> searches<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
on they lost both of the searches in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.020 
on they lost both of the searches in
that<00:01:02.280> series<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.539> SB<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> top<00:01:05.700> 4

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that series and so SB is in the top 4

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.980 
that series and so SB is in the top 4
and<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.240> looks<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.479> they're<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> play

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and it looks like they're going to play

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.380 
and it looks like they're going to play
curse<00:01:07.260> lv<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.860> open<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.880> curse<00:01:09.180> has

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
curse lv to open it up because curse has

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
curse lv to open it up because curse has
the<00:01:09.510> number<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.900> seed<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.159> number<00:01:11.460> two<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the number one seed the number two and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460 
the number one seed the number two and
three<00:01:12.000> seed<00:01:12.180> i<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.510> no<00:01:12.780> idea<00:01:12.960> how<00:01:13.320> they

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
three seed i have no idea how they

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
three seed i have no idea how they
decide<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.310> TK<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.470> NVR<00:01:16.470> tied<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
decide this but TK and NVR tied with the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.740 
decide this but TK and NVR tied with the
number<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.740> match<00:01:19.740> wins<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:21.060> envious<00:01:21.540> has

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
number of match wins but envious has

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.370 
number of match wins but envious has
more<00:01:22.020> math<00:01:22.830> wins<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:24.030> i<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.150> TK<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:25.020> more

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
more math wins but i think TK has more

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100 
more math wins but i think TK has more
wins<00:01:25.619> against<00:01:26.340> NV<00:01:26.729> themselves<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:27.930> don't

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
wins against NV themselves so i don't

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
wins against NV themselves so i don't
know<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.380> decide<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> doesn't

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
know how they decide but it doesn't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
know how they decide but it doesn't
matter<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.790> those<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.960> teams<00:01:31.200> play<00:01:31.409> each

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
matter because those two teams play each

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950 
matter because those two teams play each
other<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.939> curse<00:01:33.150> lv<00:01:33.329> being<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> number

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
other and then curse lv being the number

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
other and then curse lv being the number
one<00:01:33.990> seed<00:01:34.290> plays<00:01:34.950> SB<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> number<00:01:35.759> four<00:01:35.970> seed

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
one seed plays SB the number four seed

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
one seed plays SB the number four seed
and<00:01:36.509> those<00:01:37.049> matches<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> take

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and those matches are going to take

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
and those matches are going to take
place<00:01:38.040> over<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> next<00:01:38.400> two<00:01:38.729> days<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.270> then

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
place over the next two days and then

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
place over the next two days and then
the<00:01:39.750> final<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.650> friday<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.759> i<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:42.000> know

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the final is on friday so i don't know

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
the final is on friday so i don't know
if<00:01:42.180> they're<00:01:42.270> gonna<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.570> best<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.960> seven<00:01:43.350> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
if they're gonna do best of seven I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.389 
if they're gonna do best of seven I
don't<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.829> they're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.189> best

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
don't know if they're going to do best

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.639 
don't know if they're going to do best
of<00:01:44.579> five<00:01:44.899> I'm<00:01:45.899> guessing<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.409> hosts

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
of five I'm guessing that hosts

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.139 
of five I'm guessing that hosts
advantage<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.159> gonna<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> highest

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
advantage is gonna go to the highest

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
advantage is gonna go to the highest
seed<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.079> curse<00:01:49.320> lv<00:01:49.530> should<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> host

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
seed so curse lv should have the host

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.310 
seed so curse lv should have the host

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
they still kept our number one seed

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.230 
they still kept our number one seed
though<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.520> started<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:05.880> seven

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
though because they started off seven

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.020 
though because they started off seven
and<00:02:06.360> oh<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:06.869> were<00:02:07.160> 21<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.399> 6<00:02:08.849> or

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and oh like they were 21 and 6 or

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.580 
and oh like they were 21 and 6 or
something<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.869> point<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.319> Matt

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
something like that at one point in Matt

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.290 
something like that at one point in Matt
count<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.670> there's<00:02:11.970> still<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> number

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
count and so there's still the number

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
count and so there's still the number
one<00:02:12.450> seed<00:02:12.720> by<00:02:12.930> far<00:02:13.260> over
