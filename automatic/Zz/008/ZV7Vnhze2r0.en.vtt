00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
think about the people I think it was

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.690 
think about the people I think it was
done<00:02:02.020> pretty<00:02:02.350> nicely<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:03.010> really<00:02:03.400> like<00:02:03.550> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
done pretty nicely I really like the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.730 
done pretty nicely I really like the
sink<00:02:03.910> so<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.780> guess<00:02:04.930> I'll<00:02:05.080> say<00:02:05.320> now<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.650> is

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
sink so I guess I'll say now it is

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.940 
sink so I guess I'll say now it is
that's<00:02:06.700> it
