now a seal you can't tell where their
ears<00:01:05.050> are<00:01:05.320> because<00:01:05.830> they<00:01:05.979> just<00:01:06.130> have<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.370> small

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
ears are because they just have a small

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.880 
ears are because they just have a small
hole<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.090> each<00:01:07.450> side<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:08.500> hold<00:01:09.390> hold<00:01:10.590> hold<00:01:11.590> it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890

females here can even propel themselves
ten<00:01:45.460> feet<00:01:45.820> out<00:01:46.090> of<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.390> water<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> that's<00:01:47.980> how

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
ten feet out of the water so that's how

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.730 
ten feet out of the water so that's how
they<00:01:48.370> move<00:01:48.550> through<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.940> water<00:01:49.500> seals<00:01:50.500> on<00:01:50.650> the

they move through the water seals on the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.830 
they move through the water seals on the
other<00:01:50.890> hand<00:01:51.220> like<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.760> harbor<00:01:52.150> seal<00:01:52.390> would<00:01:52.630> have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
their front flippers are about the size

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.180 
their front flippers are about the size
of<00:01:55.120> an<00:01:55.240> adult<00:01:55.330> male<00:01:55.810> human<00:01:56.500> hands<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.160> can

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
of an adult male human hands so you can

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.740 
of an adult male human hands so you can
imagine<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.820> quite<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.060> big<00:01:58.360> difference

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
imagine the quite the big difference

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.410 
imagine the quite the big difference
between<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:59.140> seal<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.560> it's<00:01:59.710> nine<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
between a seal and it's nine and the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.000 
between a seal and it's nine and the
last<00:02:01.660> way<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.050> tell<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.380> difference<00:02:02.410> is<00:02:02.890> you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
last way to tell the difference is you

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.910 
last way to tell the difference is you
watch<00:02:03.190> how<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> sea<00:02:03.700> lion<00:02:03.850> moves<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.480> liyan
