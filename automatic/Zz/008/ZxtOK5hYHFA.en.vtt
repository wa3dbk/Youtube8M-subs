00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.000
 speaks guys youtube all quiet 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.740
 with you 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.320
 who is speaking that isaac hotel 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 apartment and how I promised 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.570
 I'll bring a video for you today. 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.869
 how to plant living half way and end 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
 from the seed to the personal harvest only 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.800
 come on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 this here is a strawberry is to meet 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.529
 market and I'm going to teach you now 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.599
 how to remove seed is very simple 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 You pick a strawberry, let's choose the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.620
 Your living here is very red, not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.160
 serve to take away the seed here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.379
 It is clear that you will never 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
 He got in here up here. 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.660
 because they are too many times while 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.649
 greener more likely seed 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.340
 germinated then took a show to 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.340
 you here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.379
 here o 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 ready then you will not take 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.650
 amount you want me already 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 I separated mine already 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:13.080
 I already added here it's more or less 10 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.970
 seeds here is enough not personal 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.070
 Leave the strawberry when you go 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.650
 removing the seed does not leave strawberries and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.350
 because when you put not only the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.320
 puts to dry the seed gets dark 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.030
 then probability of you access 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.990
 seminar will stay a little longer 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.869
 difficult then bought take time to and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 just put the earth 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.270
 I recommend planting seed 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.520
 seed a sowing if you do not 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.990
 have been sown 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.299
 this is a pot of chocolate and candy 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 that costs 60 cents is very similar to 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.689
 a whole week and the strawberry gave 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.820
 Very well here I'm going to start here only in 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.340
 three bills not the video will get much 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:09.360
 long take here and here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.830
 I came back here, guys, 3 seeds per 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.470
 each cell 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.370
 I put three segments here for each 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.069
 ballot something else very important 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.940
 so that the seeds germinate until 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.390
 the earth has to be sieved a land 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.580
 neutral and also play over the earth 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.780
 It has to be a land sifted with 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.670
 Bran why not put this on 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.010
 It's hard to climb like this here in a 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.380
 product in front of store pictures 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.849
 agricultural sector I see that this is a 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.780
 earth sieve the substrate let's play 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.780
 over 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.569
 then the next easy played over 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:02.640
 You'll have to do what you have to do. 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.650
 win can not be loaded nest 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.829
 else is like 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.650
 watering can 5 a spray bottle because the seed 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.819
 Strawberry are very small then 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.700
 If you 're here, I'll water the seed. 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.700
 and it will not end you have to do 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.370
 That's it folks than doing this two 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.380
 times per day 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.639
 there you cover because this here is a 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.130
 protection you discover that leaves you 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.290
 three hours 14 hours of morning sun 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.060
 afternoon cassol 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.060
 made it the staff after 20 days 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:53.450
 the result is this here ok I will show 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:57.329
 for you now the strawberry seeds 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.459
 germinated not all germinates like you 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.319
 You can see that is not here do not have to 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.130
 I do not have to, but I have 20 days here. 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.290
 staff germinated 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.320
 now there is also another staff person 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.770
 way to plant orang by molting 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.010
 I'll be here too now is this 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.010
 on here 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.450
 so here is a change of strawberry I 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.790
 I bought where to see you like what? 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.340
 you should plant what you should do 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.280
 to succeed to reap strawberry is 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.930
 very simple 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.380
 bought the coin pick your pot do the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.030
 drainage system 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.600
 put it gravel or anything else 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:49.010
 have to be able to make a system and 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.540
 send the earth to divide it is another thing 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.640
 very important 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.760
 fertilization there is no doubt with a product 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.120
 chemical you will use is to have 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.780
 each and a worm monk you do not 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.830
 have tesser every time here is better 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.050
 thing that has 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.390
 I recommend is the more complete than 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.080
 there are some and also for my opinion 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:20.460
 the best or that we have each 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:26.219
 and to the vegetable soil that's what you 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:29.879
 they will put you put there 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:33.419
 you are going to cover with land here in 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:35.310
 above do not cover here in the middle but you 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.330
 they will end up smothering the flowers that go 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.009
