00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.859
 windows 8 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 to have the windows transfer 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.670
 are these parts make us transparent 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.220
 as we have it in windows 7 too 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 for the browser taskbar all 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.600
 what has a little eyelash is going to see 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.900
 Transparent ok let's start with the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.530
 tutorial 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.020
 for the first one they will be downloading 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.810
 this weird file that I'm going to leave 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.750
 in the description of the video link are 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.250
 uploaded by mega means here is the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.809
 link you the ones that are going to collapse 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:08.080
 accept the terms of the service and not 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.350
 a download here will directly tell him 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 is to do the download and once 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 downloaded the file what are we going to 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.880
 do going right click will extract with 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.649
 once the file is extracted, we will 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 have a folder like it is ok now 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.229
 having is so enlarged a capital to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.229
 the turn 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.550
 having was like that what we're going to do 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.550
 will do 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.180
 click on the place 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.620
 blas 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.480
 we are doing 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.400
 we give him 5 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.910
 we will accept 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.090
 and ready now let's open the oil we 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.090
 care 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:08.409
 we go 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.409
 now as we have the twitter 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.670
 once you have many are ok what are we going 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.430
 to do obviously as well as we have it 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.280
 Here we will leave it as it is 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.910
 is here I recommend not to move anything 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.230
 leave it as it is ok ok well 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.569
 movie we are going to give in apply 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.400
 as you see we have the aero effect 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.159
 glass but it's also complete right now 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.920
 I'm going to explain them well now after 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.380
 of this we are going to give in ok 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.650
 and now it is now to do it totally 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.540
 glass 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.540
 let's customize 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.660
 on the subject and we will put in color 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.850
 for example led to choose blue and the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.380
 opacity or color intensity is the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.810
 let's lower the maximum save changes 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.990
 and now our air is ready 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.790
 glass as you see this this is no longer a 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.459
 trial version this is the version 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.040
 final is already the full version in this 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.020
 the only drawback is that everyone 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.819
 we did our system is going to 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.440
 appear a little window the truth I do not 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.000
 agreement that says but we will not see 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.710
 an accept and it no longer seemed ok 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.580
 well, now 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.580
 the next 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.120
 We will move this folder to a place 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.850
 where we are not going to move it anymore 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.620
 example, I 'm going to cut it 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.490
 I recommend they cry for documents because 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.580
 I do not the personal thing is a folder that does not 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.200
 I move it so I recommended it 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.280
 collaborate here is preference of each 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.570
 who 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.550
 and once saved we have ready but 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.820
 as good I already had it for all 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.100
 what I did to teach them the tutorial 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.470
 now some will appear 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.700
 windows but there will not be any 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.060
 change in the taskbar what 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.680
 let's make you right click 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.859
 Task Manager 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.859
 and we're going to go down to where I say 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.570
 windows explorer in this option 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.710
 let's click and restart to put 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.230
 the screen does not get scared nothing happens 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.840
 and once I finish thick 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.850
 we are going to close and the taskbar of 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.420
 montgat seems to be transparent and 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.550
 I repeat to me it did not seem good to me not 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.130
 it seems transparent to me because I already 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.720
 I had but you the most problems 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.250
 likely it does not go away 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.080
 totally transparent that's why 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.910
 they have to do the procedure 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.660
