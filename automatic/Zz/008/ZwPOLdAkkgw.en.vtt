think that's the easiest way to explain
how<00:00:11.030> to<00:00:11.240> use<00:00:11.389> all<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:11.840> different<00:00:11.930> findings

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
how to use all the different findings

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.039 
how to use all the different findings
findings<00:00:13.879> being<00:00:14.090> the<00:00:14.240> term<00:00:14.420> for<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:14.840> kind<00:00:15.020> of

hooks and clasps and wiry bits that you
use<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:17.600> actually<00:00:17.720> make<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.199> beads<00:00:18.380> into<00:00:18.590> some

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
use to actually make the beads into some

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.529 
use to actually make the beads into some
jewelry<00:00:19.190> so<00:00:20.060> we're<00:00:20.150> going<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.300> start<00:00:20.449> with

going to use the round nose pliers that

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.509 
going to use the round nose pliers that
we<00:00:45.319> talked<00:00:45.530> about<00:00:45.620> briefly<00:00:45.949> at<00:00:46.069> the<00:00:46.100> beginning

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
and we're going to use these to just

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.250 
and we're going to use these to just
open<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.219> loop<00:00:49.489> up<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.479> all<00:00:50.749> I'm<00:00:50.929> going<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.109> do

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
open this loop up so all I'm going to do

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.619 
open this loop up so all I'm going to do
is<00:00:51.530> actually<00:00:51.769> put<00:00:52.159> one<00:00:52.519> of<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.729> prongs<00:00:52.969> of<00:00:53.359> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
is actually put one of the prongs of the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.349 
is actually put one of the prongs of the
pliers<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.379> grip<00:00:54.979> it<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:55.729> then<00:00:56.149> just

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
pliers in there grip it and then just

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.009 
pliers in there grip it and then just
pull<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.659> so<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.199> comes<00:00:57.379> open<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.690> hang<00:00:59.870> my

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
pull it so it comes open and I hang my

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.959 
pull it so it comes open and I hang my
little<00:01:00.260> pendant<00:01:00.559> part<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:00.949> there<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.789> now<00:01:01.909> we

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
little pendant part on there and now we

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.910 
little pendant part on there and now we
just<00:01:02.179> need<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.420> close<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.809> up<00:01:02.929> so<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.739> same

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
just need to close it up so the same

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.649 
just need to close it up so the same
thing<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.460> put<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.760> round<00:01:04.909> nose<00:01:05.120> pliers<00:01:05.449> in

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
thing you put the round nose pliers in

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.390 
thing you put the round nose pliers in
there<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.380> little<00:01:06.560> ball<00:01:06.799> does<00:01:07.070> slide<00:01:07.280> around

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
there this little ball does slide around

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.740 
there this little ball does slide around
and<00:01:07.760> get<00:01:07.850> in<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.030> way<00:01:08.120> so<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.360> need<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.570> pull

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
and get in the way so you need to pull

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.050 
and get in the way so you need to pull
that<00:01:08.780> back<00:01:09.140> out<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.560> way<00:01:09.730> and<00:01:10.730> use<00:01:10.940> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
that back out of the way and use the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.940 
that back out of the way and use the
pliers<00:01:11.300> to<00:01:11.420> do<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.750> up<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.620> there<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:12.830> go

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
pliers to do it up and there you go

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.410 
pliers to do it up and there you go
that's<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.250> simplest<00:01:13.670> earring<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.120> do

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
that's the simplest earring you can do

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.170 
that's the simplest earring you can do
really<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.810> takes<00:01:15.020> like<00:01:15.230> less<00:01:15.650> than<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.860> minute

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
really it takes like less than a minute

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.070 
really it takes like less than a minute
obviously<00:01:17.180> want<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.390> do<00:01:17.480> another<00:01:17.630> one<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.930> make

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
obviously want to do another one to make

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.970 
obviously want to do another one to make
a<00:01:18.110> pair<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.700> that's<00:01:19.880> him<00:01:20.380> next<00:01:21.380> we're<00:01:21.800> going<00:01:21.890> to

loops<00:01:34.760> on<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.120> end<00:01:35.150> for<00:01:35.690> kind<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.930> attaching

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
loops on the end for kind of attaching

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.340 
loops on the end for kind of attaching
to<00:01:36.590> things<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.760> I<00:01:38.120> want<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.570> open<00:01:38.660> that<00:01:38.900> loop<00:01:39.050> up

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
to things so I want to open that loop up

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.590 
to things so I want to open that loop up
and<00:01:39.560> again<00:01:40.310> we<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:40.820> stick<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.120> pliers<00:01:41.360> in

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and again we just stick the pliers in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.630 
and again we just stick the pliers in
there<00:01:41.780> grip<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.620> just<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.190> little<00:01:43.280> bit<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.580> a

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
there grip it and just a little bit of a

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
there grip it and just a little bit of a
wrist<00:01:43.850> action<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:45.320> open<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.680> up<00:01:46.510> hang<00:01:47.510> that

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
wrist action to open that up hang that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.170 
wrist action to open that up hang that
on<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.080> then<00:01:49.010> again<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.400> close<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:49.790> up

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
on and then again to close it up

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.390 
on and then again to close it up
so<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.630> grip<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.260> and<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.590> use<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.980> roundness

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
so I grip that and I use the roundness

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.550 
so I grip that and I use the roundness
of<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.670> pliers<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.390> close<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.750> back<00:01:53.900> up<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.320> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
of the pliers to close it back up in a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.310 
of the pliers to close it back up in a
loop<00:01:55.570> next<00:01:56.570> I'm<00:01:56.660> just<00:01:56.690> going<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:56.930> pop<00:01:57.080> some

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
loop next I'm just going to pop some

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.650 
loop next I'm just going to pop some
beads<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:57.740> there<00:01:58.150> these<00:01:59.150> are<00:01:59.360> just<00:01:59.510> some

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
beads on there these are just some

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.750 
beads on there these are just some
plastic<00:02:00.140> miracle<00:02:00.800> beads<00:02:01.010> they're<00:02:01.370> quite<00:02:01.580> nice

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
plastic miracle beads they're quite nice

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.340 
plastic miracle beads they're quite nice
they<00:02:02.000> catch<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.420> light<00:02:02.570> but<00:02:02.990> obviously<00:02:03.230> you

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
they catch the light but obviously you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.550 
they catch the light but obviously you
can<00:02:03.530> use<00:02:03.560> anything<00:02:04.540> okay<00:02:05.540> now<00:02:06.230> we<00:02:06.290> need<00:02:06.440> to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
can use anything okay now we need to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.899 
can use anything okay now we need to
make<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> loop<00:02:06.950> at<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.130> top<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.670> to

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
make a loop at the top of here to

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.630 
make a loop at the top of here to
actually<00:02:08.179> attach<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.319> ear<00:02:09.500> wire<00:02:09.739> so

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
actually attach that to the ear wire so

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.670 
actually attach that to the ear wire so
first<00:02:10.909> of<00:02:11.060> all<00:02:11.209> I'm<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.659> to<00:02:11.780> bend<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.290> I

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
first of all I'm going to bend that I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.340 
first of all I'm going to bend that I
pin<00:02:13.130> over<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.880> right<00:02:14.090> angles<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> top<00:02:15.080> bead

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
pin over at right angles to the top bead

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.530 
pin over at right angles to the top bead
oops<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.819> can<00:02:16.940> do<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.300> with<00:02:17.450> your

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
oops now you can do this just with your

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.340 
oops now you can do this just with your
fingers<00:02:17.960> or

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
fingers or

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.740 
fingers or
with<00:02:18.470> applies<00:02:18.740> whichever<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.400> prefer<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
with applies whichever you prefer and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.960 
with applies whichever you prefer and
I'm<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.380> cut<00:02:21.560> off<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.890> excess<00:02:22.010> I'm

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
I'm going to cut off the excess I'm

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.190 
I'm going to cut off the excess I'm
going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.240> bend<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.480> look<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> bit<00:02:23.930> closer

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
going to bend that look a bit closer

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.620 
going to bend that look a bit closer
actually<00:02:24.500> cuz<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:24.800> want<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.040> quite<00:02:25.220> close<00:02:25.630> to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
actually cuz you want it quite close to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.420 
actually cuz you want it quite close to
that<00:02:26.840> B<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.860> better

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
that B there we go that's better

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.720 
that B there we go that's better
so<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.600> cutters<00:02:30.070> cut<00:02:31.070> off<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> excess<00:02:31.580> you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
so the cutters cut off the excess you

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.710 
so the cutters cut off the excess you
wanted<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:31.970> save<00:02:32.150> yourself<00:02:32.450> about<00:02:32.660> a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
wanted to save yourself about a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.100 
wanted to save yourself about a
centimeter<00:02:33.940> when<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.060> cut<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> Y's<00:02:35.840> do

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
centimeter when you cut this the Y's do

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.510 
centimeter when you cut this the Y's do
fly<00:02:36.380> around<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.770> little<00:02:36.860> bit<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.220> tend<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
fly around a little bit so I tend to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.180 
fly around a little bit so I tend to
point<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.910> down<00:02:38.090> towards<00:02:38.450> my<00:02:38.570> bead<00:02:38.750> map<00:02:39.190> I'm

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
point it down towards my bead map I'm

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.410 
point it down towards my bead map I'm
just<00:02:40.310> going<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.460> trim<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.820> bit<00:02:41.000> more<00:02:41.240> of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
just going to trim a little bit more of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.710 
just going to trim a little bit more of
that<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:43.040> then<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.940> round<00:02:44.120> nose<00:02:44.330> pliers

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
that one and then the round nose pliers

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.410 
that one and then the round nose pliers
I'm<00:02:45.320> going<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.830> grip<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.220> very<00:02:46.550> very<00:02:46.760> end<00:02:47.090> of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
I'm going to grip the very very end of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.300 
I'm going to grip the very very end of
that<00:02:47.600> wire<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.530> I'm<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.800> do<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:48.980> partway

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
that wire but I'm going to do it partway

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.340 
that wire but I'm going to do it partway
down<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.640> pliers<00:02:50.090> if<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.570> use<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> very<00:02:50.960> end<00:02:51.230> of

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
down the pliers if I use the very end of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.960 
down the pliers if I use the very end of
the<00:02:51.440> plies<00:02:51.680> they're<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.160> narrow<00:02:52.460> there<00:02:52.790> that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the plies they're so narrow there that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.280 
the plies they're so narrow there that
you'll<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.240> loop<00:02:53.510> that's<00:02:53.690> too<00:02:53.870> small<00:02:53.990> to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
you'll get a loop that's too small to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.320 
you'll get a loop that's too small to
work<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:54.740> so<00:02:55.490> it's<00:02:55.640> partway<00:02:55.910> down<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
work with so it's partway down the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.540 
work with so it's partway down the
pliers<00:02:56.600> at<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.290> very<00:02:57.500> end<00:02:57.710> of<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.950> wire<00:02:58.130> and

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
pliers at the very end of the wire and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.400 
pliers at the very end of the wire and
then<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.360> au<00:02:59.600> then<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.080> bring<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.290> back

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
then it's au then just bring it back

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.230 
then it's au then just bring it back
over<00:03:00.740> itself<00:03:00.920> using<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.610> roundness<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
over itself using the roundness of the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.440 
over itself using the roundness of the
pliers<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.990> create<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.800> loop<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:05.180> get<00:03:05.300> about

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
pliers to create that loop you get about

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.820 
pliers to create that loop you get about
half<00:03:05.690> way<00:03:05.870> round<00:03:06.110> then<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.410> can't<00:03:06.590> actually

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
half way round then you can't actually

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.260 
half way round then you can't actually
twist<00:03:07.100> anymore<00:03:07.520> she<00:03:07.640> better<00:03:07.790> take<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> pliers

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
twist anymore she better take the pliers

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.660 
twist anymore she better take the pliers
out<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.770> reposition<00:03:09.770> them<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.430> at<00:03:10.550> this

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
out and reposition them and at this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.090 
out and reposition them and at this
stage<00:03:10.730> before<00:03:11.210> I<00:03:11.420> close<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.750> loop<00:03:12.140> up<00:03:12.380> I'm

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
stage before I close that loop up I'm

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.910 
stage before I close that loop up I'm
going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.490> hang<00:03:13.640> my<00:03:13.820> ear<00:03:14.000> wire<00:03:14.270> on<00:03:14.450> there<00:03:14.920> so

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
going to hang my ear wire on there so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.460 
going to hang my ear wire on there so
again<00:03:16.220> grip<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.610> very<00:03:16.910> end<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.300> wire<00:03:17.470> and

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
again grip the very end of the wire and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.290 
again grip the very end of the wire and
bring<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.890> round<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.520> that<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.730> touches<00:03:19.970> back

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
bring that round so that it touches back

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.690 
bring that round so that it touches back
on<00:03:20.450> itself<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.930> makes<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.200> secure<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.830> that's

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
on itself and makes it secure so that's

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.130 
on itself and makes it secure so that's
just<00:03:22.850> sort<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.060> one<00:03:23.240> step<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:23.930> from<00:03:24.050> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
just sort of one step on really from the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.540 
just sort of one step on really from the
first<00:03:24.260> one<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.560> did<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.770> adding<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.160> few<00:03:25.370> beads

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
first one we did just adding a few beads

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.170 
first one we did just adding a few beads
on<00:03:25.730> there<00:03:25.910> using<00:03:26.210> an<00:03:26.300> eye<00:03:26.420> pin<00:03:27.820> next<00:03:28.820> I'm<00:03:28.970> going

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
on there using an eye pin next I'm going

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.880 
on there using an eye pin next I'm going
to<00:03:29.240> do<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.390> pair<00:03:29.630> like<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:30.050> which<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.530> all

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
to do a pair like this which is all

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.200 
to do a pair like this which is all
beads<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:31.430> you're<00:03:31.520> going<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.700> cheat<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.060> use

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
beads not you're going to cheat and use

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.750 
beads not you're going to cheat and use
a<00:03:32.240> pendant<00:03:32.660> part<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.050> time<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:34.100> we<00:03:34.310> start<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
a pendant part this time so we start the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.320 
a pendant part this time so we start the
bottom<00:03:34.880> bead<00:03:35.360> we<00:03:35.750> need<00:03:35.960> a<00:03:36.170> head<00:03:36.410> pin<00:03:37.270> now<00:03:38.270> the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
bottom bead we need a head pin now the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.660 
bottom bead we need a head pin now the
head<00:03:38.510> pins<00:03:38.750> again<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.380> some<00:03:39.740> same<00:03:40.310> length<00:03:40.520> as

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
head pins again it's some same length as

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.220 
head pins again it's some same length as
the<00:03:40.760> eye<00:03:40.790> pins<00:03:41.120> it's<00:03:41.330> just<00:03:41.540> got<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.750> flat<00:03:41.990> end

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
the eye pins it's just got the flat end

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.350 
the eye pins it's just got the flat end
on<00:03:42.440> there<00:03:42.680> not<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.490> loop<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.910> that's<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.240> one

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
on there not the loop so that's the one

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.000 
on there not the loop so that's the one
you<00:03:44.480> use<00:03:44.690> for<00:03:44.720> your<00:03:44.990> bottom<00:03:45.350> bead<00:03:45.620> because<00:03:45.890> you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
you use for your bottom bead because you

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.530 
you use for your bottom bead because you
don't<00:03:46.160> really<00:03:46.310> want<00:03:46.490> to<00:03:46.610> loop<00:03:46.820> coming<00:03:47.330> out<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
don't really want to loop coming out the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.050 
don't really want to loop coming out the
bottom<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.840> your<00:03:47.900> earring<00:03:48.460> so<00:03:49.460> I'm<00:03:49.850> going<00:03:50.030> to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
bottom of your earring so I'm going to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.470 
bottom of your earring so I'm going to
pop<00:03:50.270> one<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.600> these<00:03:50.720> little<00:03:50.900> stars<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.410> first

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
pop one of these little stars on first

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.240 
pop one of these little stars on first
again<00:03:53.480> we<00:03:53.840> start<00:03:54.080> off<00:03:54.230> by<00:03:54.380> bending<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:54.890> over<00:03:54.980> at

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
again we start off by bending it over at

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.730 
again we start off by bending it over at
right<00:03:55.430> angles<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:55.970> top<00:03:56.330> bead<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.620> do

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
right angles to that top bead and we do

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.830 
right angles to that top bead and we do
this<00:03:57.920> because<00:03:58.040> if<00:03:58.250> we<00:03:58.340> were<00:03:58.460> to<00:03:58.520> bend<00:03:59.390> it<00:03:59.660> keep

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
this because if we were to bend it keep

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.510 
this because if we were to bend it keep
the<00:03:59.960> wire<00:04:00.140> straight<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:00.770> Bend<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.370> loop

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
the wire straight and then Bend the loop

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.800 
the wire straight and then Bend the loop
you<00:04:01.610> end<00:04:01.760> up<00:04:01.850> with<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.030> bit<00:04:02.150> like<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.300> letter<00:04:02.540> P

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
you end up with a bit like a letter P

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.230 
you end up with a bit like a letter P
shaped<00:04:03.200> whereas<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.160> way<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.880> loop<00:04:05.060> should

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
shaped whereas this way the loop should

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.020 
shaped whereas this way the loop should
end<00:04:05.420> up<00:04:05.570> centrally<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.740> head<00:04:06.890> pin<00:04:07.130> so

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
end up centrally to the head pin so

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.060 
end up centrally to the head pin so
again<00:04:08.270> it's<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.690> round<00:04:08.900> nose<00:04:09.140> pliers<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.010> you

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
again it's the round nose pliers so you

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.770 
again it's the round nose pliers so you
grip<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.400> very<00:04:10.700> end<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.150> wire<00:04:11.330> about

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
grip the very end of the wire about

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.220 
grip the very end of the wire about
halfway<00:04:12.620> down<00:04:12.980> those<00:04:13.250> pliers<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.660> wrap

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
halfway down those pliers and just wrap

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.740 
halfway down those pliers and just wrap
it<00:04:15.410> round<00:04:15.590> over<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.250> top<00:04:16.460> to<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.540> loop

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
it round over the top to get that loop

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.830 
it round over the top to get that loop
coming<00:04:18.200> before<00:04:19.010> you<00:04:19.280> close<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.820> I'm<00:04:20.150> going<00:04:20.780> to

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
coming before you close it I'm going to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.660 
coming before you close it I'm going to
attach<00:04:21.080> an<00:04:21.260> eye<00:04:21.440> pin<00:04:21.770> because<00:04:22.310> that's<00:04:22.550> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
attach an eye pin because that's the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.900 
attach an eye pin because that's the
next<00:04:22.880> bit<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.660> add<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> bead<00:04:24.080> on<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.430> grip<00:04:25.760> the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
next bit to add the bead on so grip the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.360 
next bit to add the bead on so grip the
end<00:04:26.060> make<00:04:26.990> sure<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.320> touching<00:04:27.560> now<00:04:28.220> it's

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
end make sure it's touching now it's

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.650 
end make sure it's touching now it's
important<00:04:28.880> these<00:04:29.030> two<00:04:29.120> touch<00:04:29.240> back<00:04:29.510> to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
important these two touch back to

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.150 
important these two touch back to
themselves<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.440> they're<00:04:30.620> not<00:04:30.650> going<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.010> come

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
themselves and they're not going to come

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
themselves and they're not going to come
undone<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.760> think

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
undone I think

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.850 
undone I think
to<00:04:32.240> begin<00:04:32.360> with<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:32.930> don't<00:04:33.110> get<00:04:33.259> too<00:04:33.500> hung<00:04:33.710> up

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
to begin with this don't get too hung up

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.249 
to begin with this don't get too hung up
on<00:04:34.039> trying<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.310> get<00:04:34.430> an<00:04:34.520> exact<00:04:34.910> circle<00:04:35.509> just<00:04:36.110> as

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
on trying to get an exact circle just as

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.900 
on trying to get an exact circle just as
long<00:04:36.440> as<00:04:36.530> it's<00:04:36.680> touching<00:04:37.009> back<00:04:37.130> on<00:04:37.310> itself<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
long as it's touching back on itself and

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.450 
long as it's touching back on itself and
it's<00:04:38.000> secure<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:39.410> that's<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.740> first<00:04:39.949> one<00:04:40.190> to

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
it's secure so that's the first one to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.029 
it's secure so that's the first one to
go<00:04:40.550> on<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.759> bottom<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:42.440> now<00:04:42.560> we'll<00:04:42.710> do<00:04:42.830> another

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
go on the bottom so now we'll do another

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.529 
go on the bottom so now we'll do another
one<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.430> again<00:04:44.360> bend<00:04:45.259> it<00:04:45.410> over<00:04:46.240> cut<00:04:47.240> off<00:04:47.360> the

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
one and again bend it over cut off the

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.680 
one and again bend it over cut off the
excess<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.710> make<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.310> loop<00:04:49.490> now<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.479> can<00:04:50.570> see

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
excess and make the loop now you can see

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.550 
excess and make the loop now you can see
here<00:04:50.780> I'm<00:04:50.870> using<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:51.169> slightly<00:04:51.380> different

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
here I'm using a slightly different

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.680 
here I'm using a slightly different
color<00:04:51.889> of<00:04:52.130> findings<00:04:52.639> they<00:04:52.729> come<00:04:52.910> in<00:04:53.030> various

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
color of findings they come in various

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.950 
color of findings they come in various
finishes<00:04:53.930> gold<00:04:54.919> silver<00:04:55.639> black<00:04:55.970> antique<00:04:56.630> gold

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
finishes gold silver black antique gold

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.930 
finishes gold silver black antique gold
all<00:04:57.139> sorts<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.470> things

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
all sorts of things

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.279 
all sorts of things
so<00:04:58.940> it's<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.150> choosing<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.810> color<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.199> you

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
so it's just choosing the color that you

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.430 
so it's just choosing the color that you
want<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.530> work<00:05:00.620> with<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:02.060> again<00:05:02.509> second<00:05:03.289> eye

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
want to work with so again second eye

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.870 
want to work with so again second eye
pin<00:05:03.949> join<00:05:04.910> that<00:05:05.090> on<00:05:05.650> close<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.860> up<00:05:07.009> and<00:05:07.610> you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
pin join that on close that up and you

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.510 
pin join that on close that up and you
can<00:05:08.000> see<00:05:08.210> how<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:08.449> extending<00:05:09.130> we'll<00:05:10.130> put<00:05:10.340> one

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
can see how it's extending we'll put one

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.909 
can see how it's extending we'll put one
more<00:05:10.729> on<00:05:12.039> end<00:05:13.039> it<00:05:13.250> over<00:05:14.650> cut<00:05:15.650> it<00:05:15.830> off<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.710> make

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
more on end it over cut it off and make

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.100 
more on end it over cut it off and make
that<00:05:19.070> last<00:05:19.280> loop<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:20.240> time<00:05:20.509> before<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:20.840> close

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
that last loop this time before I close

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.950 
that last loop this time before I close
it<00:05:21.289> up<00:05:21.820> I'm<00:05:22.820> going<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.030> hang<00:05:23.270> an<00:05:23.360> ear<00:05:23.479> wire<00:05:23.690> off

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
it up I'm going to hang an ear wire off

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.990 
it up I'm going to hang an ear wire off
it<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:26.570> then<00:05:26.750> finish<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.110> off<00:05:27.789> there<00:05:28.789> you<00:05:28.849> go

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
it and then finish it off there you go

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.089 
it and then finish it off there you go
another<00:05:29.570> fairly<00:05:29.870> simple<00:05:30.289> earring<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.830> mean

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
another fairly simple earring I mean

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.379 
another fairly simple earring I mean
I've<00:05:31.190> put<00:05:31.400> three<00:05:31.580> on<00:05:31.789> there<00:05:31.910> off<00:05:32.060> so<00:05:32.150> you<00:05:32.240> can

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
I've put three on there off so you can

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.540 
I've put three on there off so you can
continue<00:05:32.720> that<00:05:32.900> as<00:05:33.289> many<00:05:33.830> beads<00:05:34.070> as<00:05:34.220> you<00:05:34.310> want

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
continue that as many beads as you want

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.490 
continue that as many beads as you want
I<00:05:34.759> mean<00:05:35.210> obviously<00:05:35.509> we<00:05:36.050> could<00:05:36.169> have<00:05:36.260> put<00:05:36.380> all

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
I mean obviously we could have put all

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.140 
I mean obviously we could have put all
three<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.830> those<00:05:36.919> on<00:05:37.099> one<00:05:37.280> pin<00:05:37.550> but<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:37.849> think

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
three of those on one pin but I think

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.310 
three of those on one pin but I think
it's<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.360> movement<00:05:38.599> in<00:05:38.870> an<00:05:38.960> earring<00:05:39.229> which

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
it's the movement in an earring which

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.689 
it's the movement in an earring which
what<00:05:39.470> makes<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.770> attractive<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.310> catches<00:05:40.669> the

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
what makes it attractive and catches the

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.149 
what makes it attractive and catches the
light<00:05:40.789> so<00:05:41.630> I<00:05:41.659> like<00:05:41.900> them<00:05:42.110> as<00:05:42.349> separate<00:05:42.740> links

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
light so I like them as separate links

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.550 
light so I like them as separate links
you<00:05:44.090> can<00:05:44.210> build<00:05:44.449> up<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.810> mean<00:05:44.990> this<00:05:45.080> one<00:05:45.289> here<00:05:45.500> is

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
you can build up I mean this one here is

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.689 
you can build up I mean this one here is
the<00:05:45.590> same<00:05:45.800> thing<00:05:45.830> but<00:05:46.130> I've<00:05:46.220> just<00:05:46.250> done<00:05:46.460> two

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
the same thing but I've just done two

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.370 
the same thing but I've just done two
runs<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.360> beads<00:05:47.599> on<00:05:47.750> there<00:05:47.930> so<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.110> can<00:05:48.229> keep

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
runs of beads on there so you can keep

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.050 
runs of beads on there so you can keep
building<00:05:48.590> these<00:05:48.919> up<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.370> know<00:05:49.460> as<00:05:49.610> many<00:05:49.789> beads

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
building these up you know as many beads

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.939 
building these up you know as many beads
on<00:05:50.210> there<00:05:50.389> as<00:05:50.510> you<00:05:50.599> like<00:05:50.780> using<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.620> head<00:05:51.740> pins

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
on there as you like using the head pins

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.700 
on there as you like using the head pins
and<00:05:52.159> eye<00:05:52.220> pins<00:05:52.520> just<00:05:53.320> a<00:05:54.320> couple<00:05:54.530> of<00:05:54.620> other

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
and eye pins just a couple of other

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.439 
and eye pins just a couple of other
findings<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.430> go<00:05:55.580> with<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:55.880> earrings<00:05:56.000> that<00:05:56.389> I

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
findings to go with the earrings that I

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.930 
findings to go with the earrings that I
mentioned<00:05:56.900> while<00:05:57.199> we're<00:05:57.289> doing<00:05:57.500> earrings<00:05:57.940> as

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
mentioned while we're doing earrings as

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.159 
mentioned while we're doing earrings as
I<00:05:59.000> say<00:05:59.180> I've<00:05:59.360> used<00:05:59.539> the<00:05:59.599> long<00:05:59.720> ball<00:05:59.930> wires

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
I say I've used the long ball wires

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.779 
I say I've used the long ball wires
there's<00:06:00.710> different<00:06:01.039> ones<00:06:01.099> here<00:06:01.430> there's

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
there's different ones here there's

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.820 
there's different ones here there's
kidney<00:06:02.300> wires<00:06:02.509> which<00:06:02.990> actually<00:06:03.289> clip<00:06:03.500> up<00:06:03.680> at

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
kidney wires which actually clip up at

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.490 
kidney wires which actually clip up at
the<00:06:03.919> back<00:06:04.099> so<00:06:04.310> they<00:06:04.430> can't<00:06:04.669> come<00:06:04.759> off<00:06:05.259> if<00:06:06.259> you

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
the back so they can't come off if you

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.140 
the back so they can't come off if you
haven't<00:06:06.710> got<00:06:06.830> pierced<00:06:07.130> ears<00:06:07.370> there's<00:06:07.699> a<00:06:07.849> whole

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
haven't got pierced ears there's a whole

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.629 
haven't got pierced ears there's a whole
range<00:06:08.389> of<00:06:08.630> different<00:06:08.690> clips<00:06:09.169> and<00:06:09.409> screws

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
range of different clips and screws

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.830 
range of different clips and screws
they've<00:06:10.639> just<00:06:10.789> got<00:06:10.940> a<00:06:10.970> little<00:06:11.150> loop<00:06:11.479> on<00:06:11.659> there

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
they've just got a little loop on there

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.540 
they've just got a little loop on there
so<00:06:12.229> you<00:06:12.320> hang<00:06:12.530> them<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:12.979> beads<00:06:13.190> off<00:06:13.340> they're

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
so you hang them the beads off they're

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.879 
so you hang them the beads off they're
in<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:13.759> same<00:06:13.970> way<00:06:14.120> as<00:06:14.180> with<00:06:14.360> just<00:06:14.389> um<00:06:14.889> things

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
in the same way as with just um things

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.140 
in the same way as with just um things
that<00:06:16.070> the<00:06:16.159> little<00:06:16.370> flats<00:06:16.610> does<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:17.030> can

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
that the little flats does you can

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.460 
that the little flats does you can
actually<00:06:17.389> glue<00:06:17.479> things<00:06:17.870> on<00:06:18.020> the<00:06:18.110> front<00:06:18.349> of

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
actually glue things on the front of

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.790 
actually glue things on the front of
those<00:06:18.590> if<00:06:18.830> you<00:06:18.889> don't<00:06:19.070> want<00:06:19.250> dangly<00:06:19.820> earrings

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
those if you don't want dangly earrings

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.659
