00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 three ways to dress piadinas ho 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.259
 designed for you obviously piadine 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.929
 those are the integral made with the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.570
 anyway any paquito recipe 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.540
 pedica di nava well in fact made in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.379
 home is better so save are more 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.210
 good 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.189
 then the piadina took me here the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 biological growth this green phase 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.990
 which is very very good so either 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.240
 sprinkled everything here then I put it there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 chopped nuts in particular these 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 here them lidl you like nannies 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 they cost little because as you know the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.300
 dried fruit costs so much then I put the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.910
 scarole that my mum has me 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.879
 prepared the climbs with these here are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.670
 practically from our garden and I am 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 simply made in the pan with a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 a little oil and a little cut you see that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.860
 now I won't put it here good 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.809
 good if you don't have the escarole there 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.649
 you could put spinach, for example 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.960
 or any vegetable here on fire 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.270
 our perino as you see I put multi 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 many vegetables I make you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.430
 see are three ways of making piadine 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.619
 obviously healthy enough dietary 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.840
 so without putting too many crap in it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 inside and then they are balanced like that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 you can see there are just the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.070
 proteins dried fruit then there is the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 growth that also many protein 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.820
 so vitamins will also come for this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.009
 how good the growth with the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.560
 really crunchy of walnuts 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.740
 very good so this is the first one 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.829
 first way the first secondary piadina 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.159
 girls line I made it classic for me 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.740
 the classic in which I put raw of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.939
 completely degreased raw ham 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 so magician 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.350
 then it took me a little bit of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.869
 pro dry fly for little and the mythical 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.689
 Neapolitan brothers this is for us 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.719
 classic precisely where they mix 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.540
 these a little Neapolitan flavors between 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.189
 them and with the raw which is very good for 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.369
 do it even more but put on carrots 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.920
 also the bresaola good good and then here 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.039
 the third one that I really like in 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.730
 which I put as you can see the tofu 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.950
 like tofu 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.709
 this one that I buy just on 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.920
 market and green coop which is very good 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.590
 I really did it in small pieces like this e 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.599
 I spent a few minutes in the pan and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.090
 I put a little bit of sesame in it 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.879
 carrie a drizzle of oil is a bit of salt 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.700
 simply this is a good method a 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.769
 way to eat tofu girls if not 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.110
 you like it because these spices in fact 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.940
 extended curry but as much taste 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.430
 of the mouse and it takes a lot of flavor because a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.129
 little understood no to tofu everything in small pieces 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.400
 then I put a nice layer of the 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.160
 mythical salsa a bus I made you 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.620
 the video is the mythical girls water 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.810
 humus sauce that I made the video ve 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.940
 I leave it overlay made with 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.400
 chickpeas and beans so its could 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.310
 this is really vegan is this and a 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.950
 vegan piadina on a beautiful note 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.440
 layer of this that is super-protein e 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.019
 genuine then it took me a while 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.209
 salad and I put the whole tofu in 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.579
 here is our dean page 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.590
 if you want then you can also put us a 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.239
 some cash you can put ketchup on 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.919
 for example I did at home 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.709
 I have tomatoes here too 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.180
 I want to add an example in 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.010
 this or that one with the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.989
 small pieces of growth 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.700
 to make it even more his knows how 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.739
 be it the one made at home or seen 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.599
 I recommend this what they have 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.310
