its name suggested from last year our

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.830 
its name suggested from last year our
team<00:00:23.960> means<00:00:24.380> that<00:00:24.620> it's<00:00:24.770> not<00:00:25.100> a<00:00:25.430> full<00:00:25.840> windows

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840

of<00:01:59.869> games<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.500> have<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.710> decent<00:02:01.549> selection<00:02:01.670> but

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
of games you have a decent selection but

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.100 
of games you have a decent selection but
still<00:02:02.540> again<00:02:02.930> nothing<00:02:03.170> as<00:02:03.500> great<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:05.110> compared

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
still again nothing as great as compared

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.819 
still again nothing as great as compared
to<00:02:06.200> other<00:02:06.560> markets<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:07.250> course<00:02:08.500> what<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.709> have

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
to understand about this is you have to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.500 
to understand about this is you have to
consider<00:02:12.250> how<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.700> compared<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.209> other

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
is battery life better life on this

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.340 
is battery life better life on this
device<00:02:23.540> will<00:02:23.810> easily<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.680> from<00:02:25.660> 10<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.960> 11

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
device will easily be from 10 to 11

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.370 
device will easily be from 10 to 11
hours<00:02:27.530> easily<00:02:28.520> which<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.360> course<00:02:29.390> really

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
hours easily which is of course really

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.270 
hours easily which is of course really
good<00:02:30.620> for<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.190> laptop<00:02:31.520> at<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.300> price<00:02:32.600> point

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
good for a laptop at this price point

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.560 
good for a laptop at this price point
speaking<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.340> laptop<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.270> going<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
speaking of laptop you are going to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.680 
speaking of laptop you are going to
always<00:02:35.750> want<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.110> get<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.440> keyboard<00:02:36.830> cover

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
always want to get the keyboard cover

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.600 
always want to get the keyboard cover
the<00:02:38.690> reason<00:02:39.080> why<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.100> type<00:02:40.340> keyboard

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the reason why and the type keyboard

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.910 
the reason why and the type keyboard
cover<00:02:40.970> which<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> one<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.570> have<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.620> because

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
cover which is the one I have is because

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.710 
cover which is the one I have is because
you<00:02:43.400> do<00:02:43.610> have<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.820> take<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.000> into<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.450> price

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
you do have to take that into the price

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.480 
you do have to take that into the price
factor<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.530> price<00:02:45.950> by<00:02:46.190> itself<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:47.230> 449<00:02:48.490> for

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
factor so price by itself it is 449 for

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.020 
factor so price by itself it is 449 for
the<00:02:50.300> device<00:02:50.630> itself<00:02:51.040> however<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.490> do<00:02:52.730> want<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
the device itself however you do want to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.760 
the device itself however you do want to
account<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.630> keyboard<00:02:54.140> because<00:02:54.380> without

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
account for the keyboard because without

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.570 
account for the keyboard because without
it<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.250> not<00:02:55.490> as<00:02:55.700> productive<00:02:56.620> now<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.400> does

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
it it's not as productive now this does

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.550 
it it's not as productive now this does
bring<00:02:58.610> up<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.970> good<00:02:59.090> point<00:02:59.150> well<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.810> 32<00:03:00.230> gig

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
bring up a good point well it's a 32 gig

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.920 
bring up a good point well it's a 32 gig
for<00:03:00.950> 449<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.060> sounds<00:03:02.390> good<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.660> terms<00:03:02.750> of

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
for 449 so that sounds good in terms of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.810 
for 449 so that sounds good in terms of
price<00:03:03.140> point<00:03:03.470> but<00:03:03.680> then<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> want<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.580> at<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
price point but then I want you at the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.530 
price point but then I want you at the
keyboard<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.450> 580<00:03:06.080> which<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.710> still<00:03:06.920> cheaper

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
keyboard it's 580 which is still cheaper

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.160 
keyboard it's 580 which is still cheaper
compared<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.690> some<00:03:08.960> devices<00:03:09.290> out<00:03:09.560> there<00:03:09.790> being

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
compared to some devices out there being

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.080 
compared to some devices out there being
599<00:03:12.170> for<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> 32gb<00:03:12.860> model<00:03:13.340> but<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:13.910> have<00:03:14.000> to

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
599 for a 32gb model but you have to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.110 
599 for a 32gb model but you have to
remember<00:03:14.210> that<00:03:14.660> since<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.710> Windows<00:03:16.190> you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
remember that since this is Windows you

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.790 
remember that since this is Windows you
are<00:03:17.300> going<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.600> take<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.870> more<00:03:18.110> storage<00:03:18.500> so

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
are going to take it more storage so

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.830 
are going to take it more storage so
you're<00:03:18.950> really<00:03:19.100> getting<00:03:19.610> around<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.240> believe

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
you're really getting around I believe

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.770 
you're really getting around I believe
20<00:03:21.290> gigs<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:21.800> less<00:03:22.340> on<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.970> device<00:03:23.240> out<00:03:23.540> of

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
20 gigs or less on this device out of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.530 
20 gigs or less on this device out of
the<00:03:23.900> box<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:25.130> with<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.520> NICU<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:26.000> mind<00:03:26.240> that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the box so with the NICU in mind that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.860 
the box so with the NICU in mind that
you<00:03:26.720> don't<00:03:26.900> have<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.140> full<00:03:27.350> 32<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:28.040> course<00:03:28.870> the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
you don't have the full 32 of course the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.750 
you don't have the full 32 of course the
other<00:03:30.020> thing<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.320> consider<00:03:30.440> is<00:03:30.770> this<00:03:31.370> device
