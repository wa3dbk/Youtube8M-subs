00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.009
 revolutionize that employs stem cells 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.069
 Sock operations then cosmetic surgery as correct as it works 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.599
 it is correct functions this way is a revolutionary women technique because it 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.439
 than in addition to 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.059
 valley of the traditional lipofilling in which we believed adipose tissue star 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.769
 - vamo to increase the volume for example peter's fabric for example in 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.820
 beautiful the udder in this case we have a machine that makes it available 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.760
 stem cells from adipose tissue therefore intraoperative mind in the room 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.570
 operation we can have the function of this machine that gives us cells 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.479
 stem nectar care we put into a part of adipose tissue that comes 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.460
 injected and then we start adipose tissue of very enriched cells 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.129
 stem 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.359
 this we have discovered scientifically that to the added value it allows us 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.880
 have the best rooting the best possible result 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.960
 of the adipose graft this is why we try to enrich the pods of 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.390
 stem cells adipose tissue and this is the only machine on the market 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810
 international level that allow us to light 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.740
 what are the advantages for women thinking about possibilities 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.730
 hahaha of diseases said never here already in there is an influence in this too 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.940
 certainly first of all the property of the united stem cells you give me up 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.360
 to pose I saw the replies regenerative properties I look for in all problems 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.430
 of breast reconstruction including the problems of 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.770
 radiodermatitis place weight problems of sn in ulcer tissues very thin you 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.130
 etc. the Kosovar treasures to generate these fabrics ended up reclaiming 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.620
 catch more 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.140
 we have the advantage of not using any type of prosthesis, do not use a scalpel 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.510
 therefore, do not use an invasive teenger but only a rising teenager 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.850
 adipose tissue injections count women who now would be interested in 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.840
 this new technique where they can find it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.120
 it is how much the norm roma armando costs compared to the normal for the elderly 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.719
 spataro normal operations costs are taken proponents therefore we try to 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.740
 not have higher costs than those of the only traditional version 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.890
 talking weather 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.029
 talking about things that go from 7 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:12.249
 if to the 8 the 9000 euros all inclusive keeping in mind that this then I become 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.759
 a double intervention but that has to do with tissue removal 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.729
 adipose from the accumulation areas and 1 comment of the queen breast a liposuction 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.619
 is a mammoplasty at the same time they find us at the medical center 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.299
