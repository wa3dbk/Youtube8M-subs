paint<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.130> design<00:03:44.490> on<00:03:44.520> first<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.540> have

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
paint that design on first so you have

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.240 
paint that design on first so you have
to<00:03:45.720> kind<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.020> think<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.950> when

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
to kind of think of and you know when

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.320 
to kind of think of and you know when
you<00:03:47.370> do<00:03:47.490> your<00:03:47.520> nails<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.090> your<00:03:48.180> design

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
you do your nails you do your design

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.150 
you do your nails you do your design
last<00:03:48.690> when<00:03:49.410> you're<00:03:49.530> doing<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.800> ring<00:03:50.040> you're

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
last when you're doing this ring you're

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.860 
last when you're doing this ring you're
sort<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.490> doing<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.820> backwards<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.420> would

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
sort of doing it backwards so you would

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.000 
sort of doing it backwards so you would
do<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.200> design<00:03:52.530> first<00:03:54.050> so<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.800> going<00:03:55.950> to

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
do that design first so this is going to

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.949 
do that design first so this is going to
take<00:03:56.220> actually<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.640> couple<00:03:56.910> coats<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.750> that

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
take actually a couple coats to get that

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.020 
take actually a couple coats to get that
glitter<00:03:58.230> completely<00:03:58.890> dense<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.790> I'm<00:03:59.850> going<00:04:00.000> to

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
glitter completely dense so I'm going to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.540 
glitter completely dense so I'm going to
repeat<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:00.630> process<00:04:00.900> three<00:04:01.620> times<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:02.280> you

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
repeat this process three times so you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.240 
repeat this process three times so you
can<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:02.850> I've<00:04:02.970> applied<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.510> coat<00:04:03.540> of

I'm<00:04:09.269> going<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.450> repeat<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> process<00:04:10.140> two<00:04:10.500> more

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
I'm going to repeat the process two more

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.080 
I'm going to repeat the process two more

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
it's pretty dense now you can flip it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.240 
it's pretty dense now you can flip it
around<00:04:21.930> look<00:04:22.229> at<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.470> from<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> front<00:04:23.040> you<00:04:23.190> can

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
gel is charred I'm going to take a link

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.240 
gel is charred I'm going to take a link

tacky layer and actually I can wipe off

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.630 
tacky layer and actually I can wipe off
the<00:04:53.770> entire<00:04:54.150> ring<00:04:55.920> gets<00:04:56.920> rid<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.160> all<00:04:57.400> the

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640

the entire ring gets rid of all the
fingerprints<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:59.490> any<00:05:00.490> residue<00:05:01.770> I'm<00:05:02.770> going

fingerprints and any residue I'm going

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.200 
fingerprints and any residue I'm going
to<00:05:03.010> let<00:05:03.130> this<00:05:03.250> dry<00:05:03.490> for<00:05:03.520> just<00:05:03.850> a<00:05:03.910> couple<00:05:04.090> of

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
to let this dry for just a couple of

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.850 
to let this dry for just a couple of
seconds<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:04.840> then<00:05:05.050> I'm<00:05:05.140> going<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.650> adhere

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
seconds and then I'm going to adhere

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.690 
seconds and then I'm going to adhere
this<00:05:06.190> to<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> ring<00:05:07.270> base<00:05:08.100> okay<00:05:09.100> so<00:05:09.160> now<00:05:09.430> I'm<00:05:09.520> just

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
this to a ring base okay so now I'm just

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.850 
this to a ring base okay so now I'm just
gonna<00:05:09.790> take<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.300> dab<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.810> glue<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.620> I'm<00:05:11.740> gonna

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
gonna take a dab of glue and I'm gonna

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.340 
gonna take a dab of glue and I'm gonna
put<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.280> right<00:05:12.310> in<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.150> center<00:05:13.570> of<00:05:13.600> my<00:05:14.080> ring

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
put it right in the center of my ring

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.980 
put it right in the center of my ring
base<00:05:15.120> because<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.420> gonna<00:05:16.540> spread<00:05:16.900> out

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
base because this is gonna spread out

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.780 
base because this is gonna spread out
when<00:05:17.230> I<00:05:17.350> push<00:05:17.620> my<00:05:17.800> cabochon<00:05:18.280> down<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:20.790> little

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
when I push my cabochon down a little

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:29.910 
when I push my cabochon down a little
bit<00:05:27.270> I'm<00:05:28.270> gonna<00:05:28.420> push<00:05:28.750> my<00:05:28.990> cabochon<00:05:29.530> down

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
bit I'm gonna push my cabochon down

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.950 
bit I'm gonna push my cabochon down
right<00:05:30.280> in<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.670> center<00:05:30.970> there<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.420> hold<00:05:31.780> it

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
right in the center there and hold it

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.150 
right in the center there and hold it
for<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.320> few<00:05:32.530> seconds<00:05:37.380> okay<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.950> final

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
for a few seconds okay and the final

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.580 
for a few seconds okay and the final
step<00:05:39.580> is<00:05:39.790> just<00:05:39.850> letting<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.510> glue<00:05:40.810> dry<00:05:41.200> so

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
step is just letting that glue dry so

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.470 
step is just letting that glue dry so
set<00:05:41.830> your<00:05:41.980> ring<00:05:42.160> aside<00:05:42.490> let<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.000> sit<00:05:43.240> for<00:05:43.270> at

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
set your ring aside let it sit for at
