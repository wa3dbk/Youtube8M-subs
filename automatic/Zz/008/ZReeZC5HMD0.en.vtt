00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.000 

pretty<00:00:44.520> nice<00:00:44.670> music<00:00:45.379> seems<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.649> laggy

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
pretty nice music seems a little laggy

pretty nice music seems a little laggy
not<00:00:47.430> sure<00:00:47.730> why<00:00:49.820> up<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> screen

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
not sure why up there you go the screen

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.470 
not sure why up there you go the screen
looks<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.550> reflective<00:00:54.180> right<00:00:54.360> now

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
looks like really reflective right now

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 
looks like really reflective right now
but<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.379> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
but that's just pretty much because of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
but that's just pretty much because of
the<00:00:56.460> camera<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.000> mean<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the camera I mean it is kind of but it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
the camera I mean it is kind of but it's
not<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.010> bad<00:00:59.219> anyways<00:01:00.000> all<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.570> you
