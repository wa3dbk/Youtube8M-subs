00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
got it for free kick a plane body is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.090 
got it for free kick a plane body is
really<00:00:20.420> straightening<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.170> dent<00:00:21.500> there<00:00:21.740> and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
really straightening to dent there and

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.560 
really straightening to dent there and
that's<00:00:23.030> about<00:00:23.210> it

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.520 

just<00:00:30.170> some<00:00:30.350> surface<00:00:30.800> rust

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.960 

but

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
but

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.850 
but
that's<00:00:35.090> fixable

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.920 

and<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.310> says<00:00:39.550> it's<00:00:39.760> got<00:00:41.160> 50,000<00:00:42.160> on<00:00:42.310> it<00:00:42.490> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and it says it's got 50,000 on it and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.060 
and it says it's got 50,000 on it and
judging<00:00:43.930> by<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.200> shape<00:00:44.470> it's<00:00:44.680> in<00:00:44.830> i<00:00:45.040> believe

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
judging by the shape it's in i believe

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.670 
judging by the shape it's in i believe
that<00:00:45.990> it's<00:00:46.990> the<00:00:47.170> old<00:00:47.730> four<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.470> electric<00:00:50.470> to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
that it's the old four and a electric to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.620 
that it's the old four and a electric to
speed<00:00:51.900> it's<00:00:52.900> got<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.470> pto<00:00:54.400> that's<00:00:55.390> kind<00:00:55.720> of<00:00:55.780> cool

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
speed it's got a pto that's kind of cool

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.080 
speed it's got a pto that's kind of cool
so<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.650> that
