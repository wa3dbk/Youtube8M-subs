 cleansing relaxing and even 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 healing sweating is known in almost 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 all medical cultures sauna and 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 steam room is also in the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.240
 cold season body and soul good 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 do and even help that you do not like that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 easily a cold gets you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119
 Nice afternoon professor 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 act like steam bath and sauna a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.170
 nice afternoon the essentials 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.670
 Effect is on the increase of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.090
 Body temperature in about 0 5 to 1 degree 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.529
 the inside of the body warmer is the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 reaction of the body indicates that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.719
 the vessels around this heat again 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.329
 to give himself up 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.879
 the positive thing is that immediately the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.700
 circulation of all organs but 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 especially the muscles 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.690
 subcutis is significantly improved and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 then in a further consequence that's what 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.600
 he many notice 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.010
 the body tries that again 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.719
 balance and then you start to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
 sweat and then give over to it 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.329
 the skin pollutes off the itself 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.010
 have collected 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.739
 is actually a medical 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.199
 a health benefit for the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.450
 Vessels for activation for this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.299
 Far narrow and for the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.510
 Circulation is clearly evidenced by it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.560
 also gives hints that probably 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.150
 the immune system profits from it 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 You have to pay attention now if you have steam 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.970
 or sauna is for everyone 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 suitable for human health can 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
 Actually, you hardly have to say anything 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.400
 It is important to note that as well 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 healthy in connection with the sun not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 forget to drink plenty if you can 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 but a lot about the sweat lost 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.350
 has enough between the sauna 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.150
 take breaks to recover 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.189
 but there are actually some 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.200
 diseases in which one is careful 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.880
 Especially should be the heart 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.020
 circulatory patient patient the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 Circulatory disorders of the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.369
 The heart wreaths have people the one 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 have very high blood pressure 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.320
 my bike is always on please 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.390
 no fall in the famous 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.180
 go cold water basin but go out 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.759
 cool down and then a lukewarm shower 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 and it is also important that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.500
 Patients who have kidney disease 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.899
 or kidney stones are very careful 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.190
 are and patients with rheumatic 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 complaints 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.390
 not at a stage where you have one 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.490
 inflammatory thrusts have in the sauna 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 go and generally the crib has 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.750
 has a cold or fever should be in 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.320
 this time under no circumstances the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.320
 go summer 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.080
 to build 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.580
 already in the body about 37 degrees the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.700
 ideal operating temperature 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.170
 This is how organs work best 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.630
 our body is constantly trying this 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.640
 maintain temperature 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.050
 in fever the body becomes hot 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.510
 heat is said to be bacteria or viruses 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.710
 weaken them with the defensive cells 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.630
 easier to fight 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.950
 the stronger the attack the more drastic 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.380
 the reaction 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.560
 but that can be dangerous 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.730
 threaten at temperatures of about 41 degrees 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.620
 irreparable damage in a sauna 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.360
 reign up to 100 degrees 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.000
 after just a few minutes, the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 body temperature up to 39 degrees 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.830
 Similar to the fever sauna is 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:17.160
 training for the immune system 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.740
 our body predecessor encouraged the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.900
 improve the immune defense and thereby 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.300
 the sun is also a form of therapy 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.920
 if you like the most effective 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.530
 is as a prophylaxis against 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.360
 colds and others 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.580
 Infektionserkrankungen sauna sessions 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.070
 we still feel comfortable 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.380
 our body adapts to prevent 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.890
 heating up too much through intensive 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.470
 sweat 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.420
 but this only works for a short time 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.870
 therefore the recommended duration of one 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.820
 We do not exceed the vintage 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.410
 trying to stay cold for a long time 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.880
 the body's internal temperature 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.730
 constantly high 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.070
 that consumes a lot of energy and already 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.980
 at a body temperature of 35 degrees 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.910
 it comes to undercooling at less than 30 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.260
 It will be life threatening 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.120
 However, at certain points in the 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.590
 body that is low temperatures as 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.390
 one after a compression or 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.700
 injury recognizes when you ice pack 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.410
 on it can do the beneficial effects 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.690
 it will be inflammatory processes 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.850
 inhibited that the swelling diminished 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.410
 and the pain receptors ours 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.989
 perceive the pain 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.520
 covered by it 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.450
 Extreme cold is the case with rheumatoid patients 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.550
 used 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.400
 they go for a few minutes in a 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.800
 cold chamber at minus 100 degrees and more 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.260
 the patients can handle this because the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.370
 air is extremely dry after the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.450
 they usually have no application 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.130
 Complaints at least for a while 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.390
 Can control heat and cold 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.100
 also be useful to our body 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.990
 Sweating is good for the body 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.810
 Regularly renovated gets less often 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.110
 sniffing the hot cold change cures 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.030
 from 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.920
 the heat in the sauna extends the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.540
 Veins the cold water of the shower afterwards 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.200
 Immediately leave it tight again 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.690
 become 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.650
 The body is trained with cold 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.650
 and cream to handle 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.530
 everyone who is healthy in the sauna is allowed 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.490
 with a severe cold you stay 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.590
 rather at home 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.240
 the heat strains the immune system 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.940
 that with the defense of the exciter 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.100
 busy is the best time for sauna 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.260
 the morning is especially for beginners 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.580
 at this time the heat can be 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.310
 easier to endure 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.320
 two to three passes are enough per 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.540
 passage no longer than 15 minutes in 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.250
 the sun will last for beginners 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.410
 up to eight minutes a warm foot bath 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.880
 in front of the sauna that's just as much 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:46.260
 sweat steam again 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:48.930
 infusion the positive effects of 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.240
 sweating will last for several days 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.240
 sauna per week is therefore completely sufficient 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.010
 after the sauna visit you should have a lot 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.020
 drink with you 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.970
 compensate for fluid loss again 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.860
 the best are water apple spritzer 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.860
 herbs or fruit tea
