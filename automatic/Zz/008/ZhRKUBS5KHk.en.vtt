00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
 In the last games the Hartberger have the first here in Hegnau 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.930
 Game half game overslept and despite six changes in the game 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.700
 Styrian start-eleven the idea is that Muslims commit more dominant 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 15 minute free kick for the outdated trouble 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.199
 Kunze center-back he stands with a hammer hard shot the 1 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.390
 0 leadership is this for Austria Christoph Stückler 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.849
 scores his third goal of the season with this powerful shot 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.800
 not as desired this prelude to Kurt Garger and his Hartberger Sun. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.679
 urgently next the Styrians in the table cover letter 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.969
 "One against one" two against two situations are increasingly trained 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.950
 but before the hosts find the first good chance 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.950
 until 10 Austria Lustenau attracted again 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.530
 maybe in defense Fortis Nick Parks fejer-konnerth Aische Langlitz 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.240
 not just for rent 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.600
 and it is number 13 a girl girl 2 to 0 for Austria Lustenau in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.510
 the 22 minute 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.800
 Choirmaster Boll, who distributes the template 5 he builds the lead with 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.530
 his second goal of the season 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.800
 this year also on this free kick on the ball and the almost goes to the crossbar 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800
 the leadership expanded what the SAS Dombach situation 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.900
 8 minutes to the break a further pass from Marc Bettinger Farnell had the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.299
 Defender Zurich on the ball 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.319
 and who after that instead of Alexander Kofler own goal and thus the 1 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.320
 2-pin hit for Herzberg 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.470
 Hofmeister completely surprised by this header of his own 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.730
 Defender Sunday no chance 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.490
 Shortly thereafter, he wanted to hard himself biggest chances from the game in the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.290
 first 45 minutes 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 Martinovic boss 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.330
 Goalkeeper Kofler is quite sure that the time of his leadership of 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.130
 Austria Lustenau at half-time 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.740
 after the page change then much too high on the part of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.789
 Arzberg stock market were last as a defender 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.480
 strikers were called this time 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.050
 Parkbad the balance in front of your eyes 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.330
 then 20 minutes later, ex-bayer Kiel IfW will make short films 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.930
 11 11 Chi has come from the DSV Leoben successfully with the time to be 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.850
 during 68 minutes 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.160
 Medicine has good timing and the important balance would be the first 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.480
 Points for Hartberg in this session 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.890
 Lustenau turn some colleagues but brought a hectic closing phase 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:14.739
 Above all referee Harald Ruiss takes care of that within one to 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.739
 six minutes three yellow-red cards from wedge 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.999
 Additional time 94 10 minutes re-election puts on the final whistle 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.280
 and it's a moment of inattention later with the ORF 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.689
 doing his second goal in this game 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.439
 Bäumer with the pass in front of the goal Lindlar hits the ball short corner but to 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.550
 little because the FCA is still used 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.980
 and leaves with his fourth goal of the season the Bay of Dreams Hartberger 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.660
 burst 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.629
 the Styrians lose after a hard fight with 2 03 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.129
 There would be only 40 players but he has to evolve the player and 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.559
 developed 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.050
 but that's very hot, of course 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.989
 even on the way 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.689
 he is very much patience demanded 2 0 led then must have one 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.909
 crazy gambling too dominant 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.889
 then it will be self-confidence and Gelson Fernandez's time itself 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.289
 as own goal and 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.689
 then we will lay down our concept and therefore wants to be determined 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.949
 the Softline makes Austria Lustenau over the fourth victory in the 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:14.260
 happy fifth game
