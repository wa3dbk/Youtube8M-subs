00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
a P&amp;L and how it worked and it dawned on

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.640 
a P&amp;L and how it worked and it dawned on
me<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.750> started<00:02:27.989> looking<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
me that and I started looking at the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.320 
me that and I started looking at the
reports<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.340> figured<00:02:29.610> out<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.879> out<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
reports and I figured out that out of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420 
reports and I figured out that out of
all<00:02:30.450> out<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> 300<00:02:31.500> items<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.040> was<00:02:32.160> buying

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
all out of 300 items that I was buying

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.080 
all out of 300 items that I was buying
there<00:02:33.390> were<00:02:33.480> only<00:02:33.690> about<00:02:34.069> 15<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.099> them<00:02:35.340> that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
there were only about 15 of them that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.610 
there were only about 15 of them that
mattered<00:02:36.629> if<00:02:37.160> if<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.489> looked<00:02:38.849> at<00:02:39.060> them<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
mattered if if you looked at them at the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
mattered if if you looked at them at the
dollar<00:02:40.830> velocity<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.790> any<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.180> these<00:02:42.330> 15

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
dollar velocity on any one of these 15

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.729 
dollar velocity on any one of these 15
items<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:45.060> was<00:02:45.209> controlling<00:02:45.690> these<00:02:46.080> 15

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
items it was it was controlling these 15

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.800 
items it was it was controlling these 15
items<00:02:46.860> altogether<00:02:47.640> were<00:02:48.209> about<00:02:48.480> eighty

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
items altogether were about eighty

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.890 
items altogether were about eighty
percent<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.470> my<00:02:49.500> total<00:02:49.680> food<00:02:50.160> cost<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.900> so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
percent of my total food cost and so

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.830 
percent of my total food cost and so
when<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> realized<00:02:53.129> that<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.670> decided<00:02:54.209> basically

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
when I realized that I decided basically

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.990 
when I realized that I decided basically
to<00:02:54.930> focus<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.769> attention<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.550> only

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
to focus all of my attention on only

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.540 
to focus all of my attention on only
those<00:02:57.150> 15<00:02:57.569> items<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.620> basically<00:02:59.069> ignore

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
those 15 items and to basically ignore

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.839 
those 15 items and to basically ignore
everything<00:03:00.000> else

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
everything else

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.990 
everything else
and<00:03:02.709> then<00:03:03.709> what<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:03.950> did<00:03:04.069> was<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:05.599> looked<00:03:05.989> at<00:03:06.379> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
and then what I did was I looked at the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.589 
and then what I did was I looked at the
weekly<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.510> monthly<00:03:10.329> item<00:03:11.329> sales

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
weekly and the monthly item sales

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.830 
weekly and the monthly item sales
reports<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.920> from<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.760> know<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.390> could<00:03:14.629> I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
reports and from that you know I could I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.780 
reports and from that you know I could I
could<00:03:15.170> work<00:03:15.379> up<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.829> worked<00:03:16.310> up<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.519> spreadsheet

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
could work up I worked up a spreadsheet

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.280 
could work up I worked up a spreadsheet
to<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.329> but<00:03:17.629> you<00:03:17.689> could<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:17.930> this<00:03:18.049> with<00:03:18.260> a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
to do this but you could do this with a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.990 
to do this but you could do this with a
pad<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.129> a<00:03:19.220> pencil<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.629> know<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.019> calculator

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
pad and a pencil you know a calculator

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.880 
pad and a pencil you know a calculator
was<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.299> if<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.540> knew<00:03:23.780> how<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.470> know<00:03:24.560> if<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.739> was

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
was that if I knew how you know if I was

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.240 
was that if I knew how you know if I was
counting<00:03:25.280> shrimp<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.939> I<00:03:26.030> had<00:03:26.239> three<00:03:27.250> menu

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
counting shrimp and I had three menu

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.550 
counting shrimp and I had three menu
items<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.670> had<00:03:29.000> shrimp<00:03:29.389> on<00:03:29.569> them<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.260> had

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
items that had shrimp on them all I had

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.849 
items that had shrimp on them all I had
to<00:03:30.650> do<00:03:30.739> was<00:03:30.889> count<00:03:31.250> up<00:03:31.629> the<00:03:32.629> item<00:03:33.230> sales<00:03:33.469> and

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
to do was count up the item sales and

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.819 
to do was count up the item sales and
figure<00:03:34.790> okay<00:03:35.180> six<00:03:35.659> ounces<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.049> shrimp<00:03:36.439> on<00:03:36.620> this

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
figure okay six ounces of shrimp on this

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.740 
figure okay six ounces of shrimp on this
dish<00:03:37.099> and<00:03:37.370> 8<00:03:37.489> ounces<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:37.939> shrimp<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.510> dish

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
dish and 8 ounces of shrimp on that dish

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.500 
dish and 8 ounces of shrimp on that dish
and<00:03:39.019> total<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.829> all<00:03:39.980> up<00:03:40.189> and<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.879> could<00:03:41.090> come<00:03:41.299> up

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
and total it all up and I could come up

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.580 
and total it all up and I could come up
with<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:42.859> theoretical<00:03:43.780> usage<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:45.230> how<00:03:45.409> much

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
with a theoretical usage of how much

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.009 
with a theoretical usage of how much
shrimp<00:03:45.919> I<00:03:46.159> should<00:03:46.400> have<00:03:46.519> used<00:03:46.760> for<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.780> month

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
shrimp I should have used for the month

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.369 
shrimp I should have used for the month
over<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.470> week<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:52.780> then<00:03:53.780> all<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.049> had<00:03:54.290> to

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
over the week and and then all I had to

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.069 
over the week and and then all I had to
do<00:03:54.530> was<00:03:54.680> compare<00:03:55.099> that<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.370> my<00:03:55.639> inventory

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
do was compare that to my inventory

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.390 
do was compare that to my inventory
usage<00:03:57.079> you<00:03:57.439> know<00:03:57.590> which<00:03:57.739> would<00:03:57.889> tell<00:03:58.099> me<00:03:58.280> how

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
usage you know which would tell me how

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.849 
usage you know which would tell me how
much<00:03:58.579> shrimp<00:03:59.419> I<00:03:59.629> used<00:03:59.870> during<00:04:00.139> that<00:04:00.260> period<00:04:00.680> of

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
much shrimp I used during that period of

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.659 
much shrimp I used during that period of
time<00:04:00.919> and<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:03.200> then<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:03.889> could<00:04:04.069> see<00:04:04.280> whether<00:04:04.579> I

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
time and and then I could see whether I

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.330 
time and and then I could see whether I
was<00:04:04.909> in<00:04:05.090> line<00:04:05.299> with<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.709> quantity<00:04:07.159> that<00:04:07.280> I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
was in line with the quantity that I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.399 
was in line with the quantity that I
should<00:04:07.609> have<00:04:07.699> been<00:04:07.819> using<00:04:08.060> before<00:04:08.690> way<00:04:09.079> out<00:04:09.260> of

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
should have been using before way out of

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.069 
should have been using before way out of
whack<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:10.069> I<00:04:10.639> eventually<00:04:10.909> took<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.479> inventory

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
whack and I eventually took to inventory

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.560 
whack and I eventually took to inventory
those<00:04:12.319> 15<00:04:12.709> items<00:04:12.859> every<00:04:13.430> week<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:16.570> the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
those 15 items every week and the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.599 
those 15 items every week and the
monthly<00:04:17.930> inventory<00:04:18.560> which<00:04:18.889> you<00:04:19.370> know<00:04:19.489> which

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
monthly inventory which you know which

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.620 
monthly inventory which you know which
the<00:04:19.760> company<00:04:20.150> did<00:04:20.329> it<00:04:20.479> was<00:04:20.659> a<00:04:20.690> was<00:04:21.079> a<00:04:22.630> entire

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
the company did it was a was a entire

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.659 
the company did it was a was a entire
inventory<00:04:24.080> of<00:04:24.409> everything<00:04:24.710> was<00:04:25.699> strictly<00:04:26.270> for

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
inventory of everything was strictly for

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.920 
inventory of everything was strictly for
accounting<00:04:28.669> purposes<00:04:28.699> in<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.330> P&amp;L<00:04:29.659> I<00:04:29.720> I

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
accounting purposes in the P&amp;L I I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.140 
accounting purposes in the P&amp;L I I
wasn't<00:04:30.860> all<00:04:30.949> that<00:04:30.979> interested<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.880> was

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
wasn't all that interested in that I was
