00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.239 
can see it but these are actually
scallions<00:01:24.219> that<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.759> planted<00:01:25.859> not<00:01:26.859> the<00:01:27.039> long

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
scallions that I planted not the long

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.489 
scallions that I planted not the long
ones<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:27.939> these<00:01:28.359> little<00:01:28.630> white<00:01:28.960> ones<00:01:29.229> right

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
ones but these little white ones right

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.599 
ones but these little white ones right
here<00:01:29.939> those<00:01:30.939> are<00:01:30.969> probably<00:01:31.420> have<00:01:31.929> about<00:01:32.609> maybe

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
here those are probably have about maybe

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.660 
here those are probably have about maybe
a<00:01:33.789> week's<00:01:34.090> growth<00:01:34.539> not<00:01:35.170> even<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.399> you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
a week's growth not even that and you

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.389 
a week's growth not even that and you
can<00:01:36.819> already<00:01:36.999> see<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.630> green<00:01:37.899> part<00:01:38.710> growing

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
can already see the green part growing

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.450 
can already see the green part growing
now<00:01:40.149> these<00:01:40.450> thin<00:01:40.929> ones<00:01:40.960> right<00:01:41.499> here<00:01:41.530> they're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
now these thin ones right here they're

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.120 
now these thin ones right here they're
very<00:01:42.729> thin<00:01:43.329> because<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.469> had<00:01:44.859> originally

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
very thin because I had originally

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.649 
very thin because I had originally
planned<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:45.909> be<00:01:45.999> scallions<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.990> multiple<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
planned to be scallions in multiple and

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.249 
planned to be scallions in multiple and
multiple<00:01:49.689> pots<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.939> actually<00:01:52.240> needed<00:01:52.959> some

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
multiple pots and I actually needed some

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.099 
multiple pots and I actually needed some
of<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.530> pots<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.579> took<00:01:54.969> them<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:55.569> out<00:01:55.600> and

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
of the pots so I I took them all out and

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.569 
of the pots so I I took them all out and
I<00:01:56.289> noticed<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.859> their<00:01:57.039> roots<00:01:57.249> who<00:01:57.490> are

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
I noticed that their roots who are

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.739 
I noticed that their roots who are
really<00:01:58.179> long

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
really long

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.129 
really long
so<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.649> clipped<00:02:00.310> all<00:02:00.490> over<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:01.029> and<00:02:01.329> replanted

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
so I clipped all over it and replanted

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.349 
so I clipped all over it and replanted
hauling<00:02:02.590> them<00:02:02.740> in<00:02:02.889> this<00:02:03.069> pot<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.270> don't

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
hauling them in this pot and I don't

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.179 
hauling them in this pot and I don't
know<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.779> it's<00:02:04.929> because<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.409> clipped<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.920> ribs

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
know if it's because I clipped the ribs

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.600 
know if it's because I clipped the ribs
or<00:02:06.639> there's<00:02:07.270> too<00:02:07.569> many<00:02:07.749> in<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.110> pot

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
or there's too many in the pot

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.120 
or there's too many in the pot
but<00:02:08.960> they<00:02:09.960> all<00:02:10.110> came<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.920> some<00:02:11.100> reason

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
but they all came out for some reason

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.720 
but they all came out for some reason
really<00:02:12.090> since<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.170> overall<00:02:13.770> when<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.310> first

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
really since but overall when you first

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.450 
really since but overall when you first
plant<00:02:15.030> them<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.560> thick<00:02:17.010> just

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
plant them they will be very thick just

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.220 
plant them they will be very thick just
like<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.850> store-bought<00:02:18.330> one<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.870> they'll

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
like the store-bought one and they'll

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.000 
like the store-bought one and they'll
grow<00:02:19.670> very<00:02:20.670> very<00:02:20.850> rapidly<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:22.530> keep<00:02:22.800> on

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
grow very very rapidly and they keep on

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.920 
grow very very rapidly and they keep on
growing<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.580> mean<00:02:23.610> once<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.270> clip<00:02:24.600> them<00:02:24.750> off

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
growing I mean once you clip them off

twice a week I remember and they just
you'll<00:02:58.830> see<00:02:59.100> them<00:02:59.280> grow<00:02:59.520> very<00:03:00.120> very<00:03:00.209> quickly

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
so if you like parents they're just a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.140 
so if you like parents they're just a
very<00:03:03.420> easy<00:03:03.660> way<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.320> go<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.730> will<00:03:05.910> have

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
very easy way to go and you will have

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.030 
very easy way to go and you will have
them<00:03:06.450> pretty<00:03:07.080> much<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.530> think<00:03:07.590> year-round

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
them pretty much I think year-round

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.100 
them pretty much I think year-round
because<00:03:08.580> mine<00:03:08.790> are<00:03:08.970> still<00:03:09.209> grown<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.930> I

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
because mine are still grown and I

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.650 
because mine are still grown and I
haven't<00:03:10.500> kept<00:03:11.370> these<00:03:11.520> in<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.850> wild<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.330> I'll

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
haven't kept these in the wild but I'll

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.120 
haven't kept these in the wild but I'll
probably<00:03:12.840> just<00:03:13.260> cut<00:03:13.500> them<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.830> send<00:03:14.100> them

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
probably just cut them and send them

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.520 
probably just cut them and send them
down<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> base<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.450> if<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.870> want<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.260> even

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
down to the base and if you want to even

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.310 
down to the base and if you want to even
see<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:18.110> camp<00:03:19.820> like<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.750> kind<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.049> like<00:03:22.290> a
