don't think I'm gonna get anything out
of<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.910> this<00:04:41.910> plant<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.360> covered<00:04:42.930> in<00:04:43.110> tomatoes

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
of it this plant is covered in tomatoes

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.700 
of it this plant is covered in tomatoes
I<00:04:44.190> had<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.150> take<00:04:45.270> almost<00:04:45.570> all<00:04:45.900> its<00:04:46.139> leaves<00:04:46.410> off

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
I had to take almost all its leaves off

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.790 
I had to take almost all its leaves off
because<00:04:47.250> they<00:04:47.460> turned<00:04:48.169> yellow<00:04:54.260> but<00:04:55.260> I've

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
because they turned yellow but I've

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.659 
because they turned yellow but I've
never<00:04:56.099> had<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.630> plant<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.870> pot<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.919> what<00:04:59.250> what

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
never had a plant in a pot so what what

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.839 
never had a plant in a pot so what what
so<00:04:59.880> many<00:04:59.940> tomatoes<00:05:00.330> on<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:03.710> let's<00:05:04.710> see<00:05:05.070> show

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
so many tomatoes on it let's see show

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:16.480 
so many tomatoes on it let's see show
you<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.180> cabbages<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.789> pumpkins<00:05:09.240> I

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.740 

think<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.669> one<00:05:17.849> we<00:05:17.970> pick<00:05:18.240> was<00:05:18.419> pretty<00:05:18.659> much

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
think that one we pick was pretty much

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.200 
think that one we pick was pretty much
the<00:05:18.930> biggest<00:05:19.050> one<00:05:19.440> but<00:05:19.770> just<00:05:20.310> what<00:05:20.760> these<00:05:20.940> ones

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
the biggest one but just what these ones

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.640 
the biggest one but just what these ones
aren't<00:05:21.419> too<00:05:21.630> far<00:05:21.900> behind<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.409> they're<00:05:22.620> all

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
aren't too far behind it they're all

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.830 
aren't too far behind it they're all
really<00:05:23.340> big<00:05:23.699> cabbages<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.270> lot<00:05:24.570> bigger<00:05:24.780> than

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
really big cabbages a lot bigger than

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.800 
really big cabbages a lot bigger than
last<00:05:25.050> year<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:27.210> we<00:05:27.330> had<00:05:27.419> a<00:05:27.479> big<00:05:27.630> thunderstorm

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
last year and we had a big thunderstorm

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.510 
last year and we had a big thunderstorm
and<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.620> winds<00:05:29.099> blew<00:05:29.130> all<00:05:29.969> my<00:05:30.030> onions<00:05:30.690> over

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
and the winds blew all my onions over

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.430 
and the winds blew all my onions over
but<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:33.000> tops<00:05:33.270> are<00:05:33.450> still<00:05:33.659> green<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.349> I'm
