 one 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.490
 Y 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.180
 hello I will prepare 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.180
 delicious recipe 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 This is a way that interests us 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.369
 delicious and nutritious food our 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.369
 boy 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.400
 or cupcakes Ã¡lava 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.610
 one - half cup flour 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.710
 maybe I'm using a cup of flour 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 wheat 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.840
 and integrate 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.660
 integrate it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.940
 let's also a cup of sugar in 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.379
 this case I have 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.620
 one third of a cup of vegetable oil 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.899
 I'm using olive oil, let's go 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.589
 also a teaspoon of powder 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.769
 bake half a teaspoon of baking 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:07.190
 a quarter teaspoon of salt two 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.610
 eggs and a teaspoon of essence 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.360
 vanilla and of course the pumpkin 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.170
 we go 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.030
 a cup of pumpkin puree very well 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.180
 first step is to prepare the mash of 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.180
 pumpkin 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.630
 is enough to give me 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.630
 a cup of puree 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.460
 and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.490
 what that will give me one afternoon 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.550
 of squash or squash puree now what 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.500
 What I do is remove the seeds 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.530
 well once we have removed the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.100
 seeds we are going to cut into pieces 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.100
 good 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.500
 it's nothing 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.640
 Now I'm going to steam this 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.710
 I'm going to use the rice cooker but if you 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.530
 they can not cook with a little water 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.630
 they put the pot 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 and cook it like 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.690
 well, we already have to cool like this 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.260
 Now what I'm going to do is remove the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.090
 pulp and aggregate in a container 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.480
 I 'm going to face you doing this and then 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.819
 I show you what is the next step 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.310
 this container and the next step is 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.560
 crush everything to have 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.690
 let's add 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.690
 and the eggs the order does not matter 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.780
 Y 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.340
 can help you 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.490
 let's say the flour 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:31.380
 integral defines it very well let's 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.380
 also the baking powder 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.010
 and we mix 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.170
 we have the ingredients ready to 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.560
 combine them now let's add the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.020
 flour 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.959
 to the ingredients 1 in this case of 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.310
 liquids and we mix so that all 5 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.620
 about very well 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.500
 we already have the ingredients of 20 degrees 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.569
 it's the consistency we're looking for 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.819
 Now what I'm going to do is add the 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.390
 vanilla essence remember that it was 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.390
 a teaspoon 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.819
 when we mix 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.219
 very well we are ready to place 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.810
 the mixture in the cupcakes molds 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.050
 or cupcakes 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.090
 I helped myself with a spoon 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.430
 let's fill it up to three quarters of 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.100
 their ability to grow we do not want that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.970
 overflow and we're going to continue here and with 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.970
 she left I'm going to show you 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.280
 very good here we already have the cupcakes 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.280
 ready to be taken to the oven 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:39.370
 I'm going to take it to the oven at 350 degrees 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:43.499
 fahrenheit or 176 degrees centigrade and what 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.499
 we go to 25 to 30 minutes 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.690
 and I have the freshly baked cupcakes 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.539
 from the oven are still hot I'm going to 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.849
 leave them here until they cool down to 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.190
