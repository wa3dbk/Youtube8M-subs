 Japan 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.030
 the black shark today is one of 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.700
 the most advanced samples of military 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.549
 aviation technician specialists consider 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.469
 that the ka-50 missile attack cannot 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.569
 endure none even the most modern 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.009
 tanks 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.869
 anti-tank missiles launched assembly 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.270
 black shark at a distance of up to eight 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.729
 kilometers target guided by the beam 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.090
 the laser will inevitably overtake the object such 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.560
 whatever maneuver and he took and if 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 all rocket ammunition already 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.970
 spent pilot ka-50 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.549
 there is still a quick-fire 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.329
 large-caliber gun 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.750
 auto tracking position 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.900
 targets unguided rockets and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.900
 bombs 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 despite such high combat power and 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.810
 serious armor black shark can 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.500
 perform in the air such acrobatic 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.079
 numbers that are beyond the power of most 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.730
 today's rotorcraft apparatus and 50 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.860
 able to accelerate to lower to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.709
 speeds of 390 kilometers per hour 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.069
 fly tail forward at 90 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.380
 kilometers an hour and sides at a speed of 80 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.420
 kilometers an hour to make a flat 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.030
 turn without changing the flight path 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.030
 perform slanting loops and other shapes 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.680
 up to 50 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.290
 the world's only combat helicopter 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 one pilot at the same time 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.819
 rescue pilot in an emergency 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.900
 for the first time in world practice 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.670
 carried out using rockets on 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.670
