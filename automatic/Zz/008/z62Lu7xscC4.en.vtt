00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
here's the first one it's called the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
here's the first one it's called the
helicopter<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> important<00:00:31.740> thing<00:00:31.920> is

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
helicopter now the important thing is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
helicopter now the important thing is
you<00:00:32.309> keep<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.059> stick<00:00:33.300> between<00:00:34.260> those<00:00:34.680> two

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you keep the stick between those two

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.810 
you keep the stick between those two
fingers<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.800> I'm<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> turn

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
fingers there and I'm just going to turn

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.450 
fingers there and I'm just going to turn
my<00:00:39.090> wrist<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.980> stick<00:00:41.250> will

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
my wrist like this and the stick will

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.600 
my wrist like this and the stick will
look<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.510> blades<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.620> helicopter<00:00:43.950> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
look like the blades of a helicopter so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
look like the blades of a helicopter so
here<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> goes<00:00:48.350> now<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> course<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.950> fairly

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
here it goes now of course that's fairly

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:02.000 
here it goes now of course that's fairly
fast<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.100> slowed<00:00:53.460> down

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.120 

ok<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.239> next<00:01:04.510> trick<00:01:05.019> I'm<00:01:05.290> going<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.920> show<00:01:06.070> you

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
ok the next trick I'm going to show you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.859 
ok the next trick I'm going to show you
is<00:01:06.310> called<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.820> 12<00:01:07.180> or<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:08.350> 360<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.330> 12<00:01:10.659> or

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
is called the 12 or the 360 so the 12 or

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.440 
is called the 12 or the 360 so the 12 or
360<00:01:11.560> started<00:01:12.250> at<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.490> same<00:01:12.760> place<00:01:12.970> where<00:01:13.360> you

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
360 started at the same place where you

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.230 
360 started at the same place where you
did<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> helicopter<00:01:14.409> about<00:01:14.940> third<00:01:15.940> of<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
did the helicopter about third of the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.499 
did the helicopter about third of the
way<00:01:16.390> along<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.750> stick<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.340> 12<00:01:19.119> or<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
way along the stick and the 12 or the

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.219 
way along the stick and the 12 or the
360<00:01:20.610> involves<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.759> stick<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:23.020> completely

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
360 involves the stick going completely

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.109 
360 involves the stick going completely
around<00:01:23.800> you've<00:01:24.220> probably<00:01:24.430> seen<00:01:24.700> drummers

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
around you've probably seen drummers

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.570 
around you've probably seen drummers
that<00:01:25.300> can<00:01:25.509> make<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.680> stick<00:01:26.920> go<00:01:27.130> right<00:01:27.430> around

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
that can make the stick go right around

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.830 
that can make the stick go right around
several<00:01:28.300> times<00:01:28.649> up<00:01:30.060> behind<00:01:31.060> their<00:01:31.300> farm<00:01:31.630> and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
several times up behind their farm and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.889 
several times up behind their farm and
so<00:01:32.020> forth<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.590> can<00:01:33.280> do<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.610> but<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.660> start

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
so forth I can do that but to start

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.080 
so forth I can do that but to start
slowly<00:01:35.289> for<00:01:35.649> you<00:01:35.800> i'm<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.430> show<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.789> the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
slowly for you i'm going to show you the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.800 
slowly for you i'm going to show you the
the<00:01:37.390> 360<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.410> goes<00:01:38.590> like<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.630> it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
the 360 and it goes like this just it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.790 
the 360 and it goes like this just it
goes<00:01:44.050> like<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.800> one<00:01:45.190> here<00:01:46.410> that's<00:01:47.410> better

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
goes like this one here that's better

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.609 
goes like this one here that's better
and<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.600> more<00:01:49.750> time<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:52.780> that's<00:01:52.960> fairly<00:01:53.229> fast

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
and one more time now that's fairly fast

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.980 
and one more time now that's fairly fast
so<00:01:54.100> once<00:01:54.280> again<00:01:54.429> here<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:54.940> slow<00:01:55.179> down

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.899 

okay<00:02:02.990> next<00:02:03.320> trick<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.250> like<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.700> call

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
okay next trick is one I like to call

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.620 
okay next trick is one I like to call
the<00:02:05.360> pointy<00:02:05.869> stand<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.790> I'm<00:02:07.790> literally<00:02:08.300> going

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
the pointy stand and I'm literally going

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.430 
the pointy stand and I'm literally going
to<00:02:09.039> stand<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.910> stick<00:02:11.239> on<00:02:11.450> its<00:02:11.660> point<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.230> my

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
to stand the stick on its point on my

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.460 
to stand the stick on its point on my
finger<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.880> can<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.660> can<00:02:14.870> balance<00:02:15.080> them

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
finger and you can you can balance them

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.590 
finger and you can you can balance them
for<00:02:15.650> quite<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.860> while<00:02:16.099> like<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.770> and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
for quite a while like like this and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.930 
for quite a while like like this and
what<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.020> do<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.170> if<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.430> sixth<00:02:22.760> asked

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
what I like to do is if the sixth asked

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.970 
what I like to do is if the sixth asked
to<00:02:23.120> fall<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.900> kind<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.230> flick<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.650> up<00:02:24.770> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
to fall is to kind of flick it up and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.780 
to fall is to kind of flick it up and
catch<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.450> falls<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.670> to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
catch it as it falls so you have to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.540 
catch it as it falls so you have to
practice<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.480> few<00:02:30.290> times<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.830> get<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.130> here<00:02:31.459> it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
practice a few times to get this here it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:39.430 
practice a few times to get this here it
is<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.430> one<00:02:35.030> more<00:02:35.209> time<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:39.080> here<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.380> is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
is like that one more time so here it is

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.580 
is like that one more time so here it is
slow<00:02:40.160> down

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
several times and then they catch it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.130 
several times and then they catch it
again<00:03:00.599> I'm<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> sir<00:03:02.010> slowly<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.849> course

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
again I'm going to sir slowly of course

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.800 
again I'm going to sir slowly of course
for<00:03:04.140> your<00:03:04.260> beginners<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.849> called<00:03:06.150> this

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
for your beginners and it's called this

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.390 
for your beginners and it's called this
trick<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.110> called<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.560> throw<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.129> catch

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
trick is called the throw and catch

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.150 
trick is called the throw and catch
because<00:03:08.730> i'm<00:03:09.000> going<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.360> throw<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.680> stick<00:03:10.950> and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
because i'm going to throw the stick and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.460 
because i'm going to throw the stick and
then<00:03:11.519> at<00:03:11.849> some<00:03:12.330> point<00:03:12.390> I'm<00:03:12.720> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.049> catch<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
then at some point I'm going to catch it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.530 
then at some point I'm going to catch it
and<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.370> goes<00:03:14.459> like<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:17.090> okay<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.480> is

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
and it goes like this okay here it is

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.199 
and it goes like this okay here it is
again<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:20.250> 180<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.060> get

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
again so this is just a 180 just to get

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.300 
again so this is just a 180 just to get
you<00:03:21.329> started<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:22.380> toss<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:23.280> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you started you toss it up and then you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.370 
you started you toss it up and then you
catch<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:25.560> might<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.860> heard<00:03:25.920> my<00:03:26.250> ring<00:03:27.380> my

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
catch it you might have heard my ring my

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.220 
catch it you might have heard my ring my
ring<00:03:28.410> make<00:03:28.920> contact<00:03:29.430> with<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.640> wood<00:03:30.230> during

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
ring make contact with the wood during

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.350 
ring make contact with the wood during
the<00:03:31.349> throw<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.769> catch<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:33.030> trick

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
the throw and catch that that trick

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.030 
the throw and catch that that trick
would<00:03:33.569> be<00:03:33.599> called<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.140> throw<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.680> click

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
would be called the throw and click

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.240 
would be called the throw and click
because<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.120> throw<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.629> stick<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> as<00:03:37.590> you

because you throw the stick and as you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.240 
because you throw the stick and as you
catch<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.700> your<00:03:39.150> ring<00:03:39.739> clicks<00:03:40.739> against<00:03:41.069> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
catch it your ring clicks against the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.860 
catch it your ring clicks against the
wood<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.120> that's<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.390> bit<00:03:42.540> harder

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
wood like that so that's a bit harder

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.680 
wood like that so that's a bit harder
that<00:03:42.989> takes<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.319> bit<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> time<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:45.450> throw

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that takes a bit of time but the throw

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.259 
that takes a bit of time but the throw
and<00:03:45.840> catch<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.290> what<00:03:46.440> you're<00:03:46.620> interested<00:03:46.829> in

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
and catch is what you're interested in

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:56.599 
and catch is what you're interested in
like<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:48.930> here<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.890> is<00:03:49.950> slow<00:03:50.250> down<00:03:55.220> okay<00:03:56.220> I

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
like that so here it is slow down okay I

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.610 
like that so here it is slow down okay I
hope<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.940> can<00:03:57.060> add<00:03:57.180> those<00:03:57.389> tricks<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.500> your
