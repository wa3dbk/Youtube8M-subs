the viewing panel you can clean with a
regular<00:00:08.130> aquarium<00:00:08.960> algae<00:00:09.960> sponge<00:00:10.830> don't<00:00:11.280> use

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
regular aquarium algae sponge don't use

your<00:00:18.060> aquarium<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.900> use<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> regular<00:00:19.350> aquarium

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
your aquarium so use a regular aquarium

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
your aquarium so use a regular aquarium
sponge<00:00:20.310> find<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.000> if<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> glass<00:00:21.750> or

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
sponge find out if you have a glass or

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.599 
sponge find out if you have a glass or
an<00:00:22.289> acrylic<00:00:22.529> tank<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.160> use<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> appropriate

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
an acrylic tank and use the appropriate

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
an acrylic tank and use the appropriate
sponge<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> takes<00:00:25.560> care<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
sponge for that so that takes care of

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
sponge for that so that takes care of
the<00:00:26.070> glass<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.029> even<00:00:27.210> use<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> clean

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
you also want to control algae from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
you also want to control algae from
growing<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> first<00:00:34.739> place<00:00:35.010> algae<00:00:35.550> thrives

growing in the first place algae thrives
on<00:00:36.719> sunlight<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.380> nutrients<00:00:38.040> when<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.489> say

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
on sunlight and nutrients when I say

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.040 
on sunlight and nutrients when I say

sunlight any kind of lighting will

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
sunlight any kind of lighting will
promote<00:00:41.730> algae<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:42.899> nutrient

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
promote algae but if your nutrient

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
promote algae but if your nutrient
levels<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.739> low<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.340> nitrates<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
levels are low your nitrates and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
levels are low your nitrates and
phosphates<00:00:45.629> namely<00:00:46.110> algae<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
phosphates namely algae is not going to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
phosphates namely algae is not going to
grow<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.960> main<00:00:49.200> thing<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
grow that well so the the main thing to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.799 
grow that well so the the main thing to
controlling<00:00:50.010> algae<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:51.390> result<00:00:51.660> in

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
controlling algae which will result in

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
controlling algae which will result in
how<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> clean<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.920> keep<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.280> nutrient

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
how you clean is to keep your nutrient

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.540 
how you clean is to keep your nutrient
levels<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.300> check<00:00:54.710> but<00:00:55.710> algae<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.370> grow

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
levels in check but algae is gonna grow

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
levels in check but algae is gonna grow
inevitably<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.600> clean<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.199> want<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> use

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
inevitably to clean it you want to use

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.410 
inevitably to clean it you want to use
the<00:00:58.710> pads<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.160> told<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> front<00:01:00.329> of

the pads that I told you on the front of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.200 
the pads that I told you on the front of
the<00:01:00.480> glass<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.590> decorations<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.969> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the glass on the decorations you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
the glass on the decorations you can
take<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.750> soak<00:01:04.110> them<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.350> hot<00:01:04.559> water<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
take them out soak them in hot water you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.160 
take them out soak them in hot water you
can<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.729> light<00:01:06.180> bleach<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> be

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
can use light bleach but you want to be

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810 
can use light bleach but you want to be
very<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.500> careful<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.130> bleach<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
very very careful because bleach is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450 
very very careful because bleach is
caustic<00:01:09.479> it'll<00:01:09.930> discolor<00:01:10.680> things<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.310> use

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
caustic it'll discolor things if you use

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.890 
caustic it'll discolor things if you use
too<00:01:11.640> much<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
too much of it and when you put the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.240 
too much of it and when you put the
items<00:01:13.260> back<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> aquarium<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.100> there's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
items back in the aquarium if there's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
items back in the aquarium if there's
any<00:01:14.460> bleach<00:01:14.790> residue<00:01:15.270> it'll<00:01:15.750> shock<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
any bleach residue it'll shock the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.870 
any bleach residue it'll shock the
system<00:01:16.680> it'll<00:01:16.799> kill<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> bacteria<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
system it'll kill the bacteria and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
system it'll kill the bacteria and
you'll<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.270> an<00:01:18.330> ammonia<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> nitrite<00:01:19.110> spike

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you'll have an ammonia and nitrite spike

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.070 
you'll have an ammonia and nitrite spike
but<00:01:20.009> bleach<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> great<00:01:21.150> tool<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.720> cleaning

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
but bleach is a great tool to cleaning

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
but bleach is a great tool to cleaning
plants<00:01:22.439> only<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.880> what

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
plants only use it if you know what

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
plants only use it if you know what
you're<00:01:24.119> doing<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:24.900> camp<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.530> don't

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you're doing a very very camp I don't

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
you're doing a very very camp I don't
want<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> hear<00:01:26.220> people<00:01:26.400> taking<00:01:27.330> my<00:01:27.450> advice

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
want to hear people taking my advice

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
want to hear people taking my advice
going<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.259> bleaching<00:01:28.590> their<00:01:28.710> aquarium

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
going and bleaching their aquarium

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
going and bleaching their aquarium
decorations<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.820> parts<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> losing<00:01:30.869> their

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
decorations and parts and losing their

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.060 
decorations and parts and losing their
fish<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.439> make<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.650> feel<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:31.829> bad

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
fish that would make me feel really bad

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
fish that would make me feel really bad
so<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> clean<00:01:33.810> using<00:01:34.259> hot<00:01:34.530> water

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
so you want to clean using hot water

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
so you want to clean using hot water
mainly<00:01:35.340> use<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> good<00:01:36.270> scrub<00:01:36.540> brush<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> wire

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
mainly use a good scrub brush not a wire

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.780 
mainly use a good scrub brush not a wire
brush<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> wire<00:01:38.159> brush<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.729> to

to plague proportions so just go with a

keep<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.500> check<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.850> fish<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
keep them in check and the fish just a

but<00:02:15.660> remember<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:15.990> plecos<00:02:16.380> get<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:16.800> big

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
so if you have a small tank maybe go

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.570 
so if you have a small tank maybe go
with<00:02:18.840> auto-sync<00:02:19.320> lists<00:02:19.620> or<00:02:19.710> algae<00:02:20.160> eaters<00:02:20.400> and
