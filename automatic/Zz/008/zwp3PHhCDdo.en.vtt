off the variety of non-lethal takedowns
we'll<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> assault<00:00:37.170> approach<00:00:37.530> which

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.630 
is lethal and action heavy in the coming
months<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.820> keep<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> quiet

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.740 

the<00:00:48.640> thing<00:00:48.820> we're<00:00:48.940> going<00:00:49.060> for<00:00:49.300> is<00:00:49.540> we're

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
the thing we're going for is we're

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.750 
the thing we're going for is we're
trying<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:49.990> find<00:00:50.140> unmatched<00:00:50.650> fluidity<00:00:51.040> with

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
trying to find unmatched fluidity with

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.820 
trying to find unmatched fluidity with
Sam<00:00:52.060> with<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.510> environment<00:00:52.780> with<00:00:53.320> his<00:00:53.440> moves

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.930 

we're<00:00:56.830> trying<00:00:57.040> to<00:00:57.100> show<00:00:57.220> that<00:00:57.250> Sam<00:00:57.550> has<00:00:57.700> a<00:00:57.730> move

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
we're trying to show that Sam has a move

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.750 
we're trying to show that Sam has a move
for<00:00:58.120> every<00:00:58.300> situation<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:59.520> took<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:00.550> lot<00:01:00.730> of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
for every situation and took a lot of

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.220 
for every situation and took a lot of
things<00:01:00.970> into<00:01:01.180> account<00:01:01.270> we<00:01:01.809> take<00:01:01.989> Sam's

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
things into account we take Sam's

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.410 
things into account we take Sam's
position<00:01:02.739> we<00:01:02.920> take<00:01:03.129> your<00:01:03.370> situation<00:01:04.030> we<00:01:04.239> take

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
position we take your situation we take

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.580 
position we take your situation we take
weather<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.720> lethal<00:01:04.960> whether<00:01:05.410> it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
weather is lethal whether it's

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.920 
weather is lethal whether it's
non-lethal<00:01:05.910> you<00:01:06.910> add<00:01:07.030> all<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.450> together<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
non-lethal you add all that together and

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.630 
non-lethal you add all that together and
that<00:01:08.440> will<00:01:08.560> create<00:01:08.680> one<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.100> unique<00:01:09.340> moves

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
that will create one of the unique moves

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.080 
that will create one of the unique moves
that<00:01:09.820> we've<00:01:09.910> got<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:12.729> you're<00:01:12.850> coming<00:01:13.000> up

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
that we've got when you're coming up

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.300 
that we've got when you're coming up
behind<00:01:13.210> someone<00:01:13.770> obviously<00:01:14.770> we<00:01:15.010> want<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.220> take

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
behind someone obviously we want to take

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.880 
behind someone obviously we want to take
them<00:01:15.490> out<00:01:15.580> quickly<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.060> efficiently<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:17.140> we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
them out quickly and efficiently so we

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.740 
them out quickly and efficiently so we
found<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.820> good<00:01:19.180> way<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.330> doing<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.630> is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
found a good way of doing it is

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.570 
found a good way of doing it is
basically<00:01:19.990> going<00:01:20.170> for<00:01:20.350> nerves<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.950> back

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
basically going for nerves in the back

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.340 
basically going for nerves in the back
of<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.790> hair<00:01:22.000> back<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.420> neck<00:01:22.600> your<00:01:22.810> kidneys

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
of the hair back and neck your kidneys

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.920 
of the hair back and neck your kidneys
as<00:01:23.590> well<00:01:23.770> again<00:01:24.369> we<00:01:24.610> try<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.000> go<00:01:25.180> for<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.540> idea

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
as well again we try to go for that idea

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.680 
as well again we try to go for that idea
of<00:01:25.960> sound<00:01:26.830> suppression<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.479> basically

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
of sound suppression so it basically

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.050 
of sound suppression so it basically
gives<00:01:28.990> Sam<00:01:29.350> some<00:01:29.979> more<00:01:30.160> time<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.640> do<00:01:30.790> what<00:01:30.940> he

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
gives Sam some more time to do what he

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.330 
gives Sam some more time to do what he
needs<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.360> do<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.470> first<00:01:32.740> action<00:01:33.190> is

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
needs to do but the first action is

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.859 
needs to do but the first action is
always<00:01:33.490> going<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.060> some<00:01:34.600> sort<00:01:34.780> of

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
always going to be some sort of

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.219 
always going to be some sort of
suppression<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:37.210> have<00:01:37.360> combat<00:01:37.899> we<00:01:38.110> have

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
suppression we have combat we have

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.960 
suppression we have combat we have
stealth<00:01:38.590> we<00:01:38.890> have<00:01:39.070> lethal<00:01:39.430> we<00:01:39.789> have

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
stealth we have lethal we have

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.410 
stealth we have lethal we have
non-lethal<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:42.100> moving<00:01:42.759> each<00:01:43.090> one<00:01:43.390> of

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
non-lethal we have moving each one of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.270 
non-lethal we have moving each one of
those<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:44.020> be<00:01:44.050> combat<00:01:44.500> stealth<00:01:44.800> lethal

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
those can be combat stealth lethal

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.969 
those can be combat stealth lethal
non-lethal<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:46.149> have<00:01:46.300> static<00:01:46.860> we've<00:01:47.860> got

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
non-lethal we have static we've got

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.490 
non-lethal we have static we've got
abductions<00:01:48.580> their<00:01:49.060> combat<00:01:49.450> stealth<00:01:49.810> lethal

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
abductions their combat stealth lethal

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.430 
abductions their combat stealth lethal
non-lethal<00:01:51.069> and<00:01:51.280> there's<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.300> lot<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.479> moves<00:01:52.750> so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
non-lethal and there's a lot of moves so

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.990 
non-lethal and there's a lot of moves so
we<00:01:53.619> had<00:01:53.709> all<00:01:53.830> them<00:01:54.039> together<00:01:54.340> there's<00:01:54.789> about

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
we had all them together there's about

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
we had all them together there's about
90<00:01:55.840> plus<00:01:56.170> moves<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.509> thinking<00:02:04.780> behind<00:02:04.840> the

90 plus moves the thinking behind the
abductions<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.920> me<00:02:06.039> it's<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.670> perfect<00:02:07.090> fit<00:02:07.119> for

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
abductions to me it's a perfect fit for

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.540 
abductions to me it's a perfect fit for
splinter<00:02:07.660> cell<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.020> mean<00:02:08.380> Sam<00:02:08.709> pounces<00:02:09.340> for<00:02:09.459> the
