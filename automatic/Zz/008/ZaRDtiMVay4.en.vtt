00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.559
 Hello in this video I want to show you visit our Spy Stuhr on her 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.490
 Monitor can move for Ubuntu already have that in another video 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.510
 Center www shown and stones if you ever had time for XP 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.750
 and Windows Vista here now the variant for Windows 7 since Windows 7 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.840
 There are several options first in the standard variant 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.940
 The taskbar is basically fixed what a move impossible 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.570
 makes 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.489
 we have to pick that up 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.190
 by hovering over the taskbar we found there on the rights 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.870
 Click the mouse button and then select the item Torres Track to fix 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.890
 which is activated by default you should see this checkmark in front of it 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.980
 From Dr lift this fixation in which occur again 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.480
 while un-fixing in Windows XP and Windows 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.570
 how was there still worried 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.180
 that the taskbar is now displayed in minimal different 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 that's how the taskbar looks like here before we get it 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.850
 So that's not displayed again 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.180
 is the fixation on rough we can now move the mouse over the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.469
 Drive the taskbar 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.349
 and with the left mouse button pressed, you can take the most part in your hand 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.119
 and then at any other position pull how could use it 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.000
 it makes sense to have the taskbar on top or left because 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.640
 this position are more ergonomic than the remaining two positions 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.200
 that's why we always have the taskbar up after that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.230
 We are often asked in the comments 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.800
 but just because it makes sense in principle does not necessarily mean that too 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.700
 they are of great benefit 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.999
 it just depends on how intensively the computer is used 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.500
 if they only short their computer once a week or once a day 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 Use time and in this time only one application 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 use 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.660
 For example, the Firefox then the saving effect is of course not so big 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.779
 as if she 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.829
 she finds herself constantly using and during this usage time 20 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.070
 Applications or more 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.149
 simultaneously 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.679
 open here have shown very briefly how this affects 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.209
 Of course, this can be done at this small 800 resolution anyway 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.849
 but they will probably not show up at home any more 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.850
 800 tons with 800 times 600 on the way 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.840
 but rather with a thousand son 80 times 1024 or even more 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.059
 understand how important that knows that we should down again 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.829
 our applications open 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.859
 want to do any work now 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.939
 as already said that he is very comfortable in the branches even if they are in winter now 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:53.480
 say 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.870
 yes okay but so awkward really blissful 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.870
 then the savings effect may be a little smaller 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.359
 when they live 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.259
 how that knows why move but over the mass 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:07.119
 How often do they do this work is the saving effect just there 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:11.069
 Just some copywriting knows that means they like their deals with the 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.919
 mouse 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.220
 then we go up and copying 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.600
 so now we go down and select the new application and now 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.929
 we have to go back 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.929
 around here now 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.439
 the whole first to impress her 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.310
 Leipzig introduces location We are sixth 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.559
 besides, it's the elaborate wisdom 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:40.729
 Select the menu up here 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.600
 below, select the taskbar 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.829
 then tried dialing the vinyl 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.329
 and so was a 19 inch monitor or even bigger more old wolf 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.209
 the whole even faster aging active 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.199
 dancer performance Obermann she should it is again a text marked even if we 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.629
 now they are already on the lower half of the monitor 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.799
 I drive up I copy and now I stay up 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.729
 and for him 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.840
 the paths are so much shorter 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.639
 In between, he also says if it has this absolute resolution 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.639
 not quite as well presented 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.539
 and if they then just have several applications open then and 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.360
 The whole thing faster, as I said the same applies to the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.360
 position 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.229
 this evening 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.400
 sometimes the whole copier abuses media to blow up 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.449
 reintroduce 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.710
 This offers the left position if they just unbelievably many 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.849
 Applications that are open at the same time that can not be grouped so 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.439
 in different programs 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.879
 not just different windows of Firefox 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.379
 and of course if you have one 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.759
 this and new a-team White Stream 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.580
 Monitors have just become wider but not necessarily higher and higher 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.610
 you can also see very nice here I would now have room for six 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.089
 further application 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:16.270
 while I'm already here at 4 at the end before the whole 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.680
 History is upset 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.920
 As mentioned earlier, there is another option since Windows 7 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.930
 then having to call either the properties of the taskbar over either 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.960
 State ownership them control 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.500
 down the rumble and how to select the taskbar 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.860
 or just click on Deltas most again on the right mouse button and then 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.860
 select the properties 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.560
 distributed throughout the day 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.699
 Taskbar we can learn here 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.050
 in turn, our almost affordably portray presentation taskbar 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.870
 take over 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.580
 Vogt will not get a visual confirmation 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.849
 we can make sure that the act automatically fades out when 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.290
 we do not need them 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.189
 then she drives up the moment she does not 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.800
 More needed is our applications will be slightly larger 

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.419
 So get a little more space for the whole 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:12.810
 the problem is natural 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.180
 Always drive to the top or to the edge 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.889
 have to 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.900
 before we get to her 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.860
 get back to then possibly other applications 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.860
 to be able to select 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.689
 two could also use the small symbols 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.270
 he also gets a little more space that if he new option in Windows 7 though 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.339
 I take the lawyers and often 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:43.389
 then the whole thing here becomes something spotlight and last but not least the alternative 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.949
 The position on the taskbar can be determined here as well 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.130
 Peter Flinks 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.879
 take over 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.460
 "Now we have more 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.460
 Space for our applications 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.860
 So much for the customization options of the Taskbar 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.320
 under Windows 7 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.600
 being everything except the last section even under Windows XP and 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.780
 Windows Vista works the saving effect is available only the 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.319
 Size of this saving is different for each user 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:15.150
 so far, it is up to them to completely suspend
