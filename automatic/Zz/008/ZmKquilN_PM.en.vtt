 Profisports employed and mine

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.310
 fan culture of the hooligans and that goes 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.310
 it's about hooligans around the world today 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.320
 when praying as a chef coach from the fc 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.320
 copenhagen 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.670

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670
 one must 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.400
 hooligan's room 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.710
 2012 is 82 minutes at the end of February 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.330
 more precisely on the 26th in the sale and 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.920
 is a documentation that is so in the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.780
 not yet seen the direction 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.270
 im very special with the brutal one 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.520
 culture hooligans culture busy 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.100
 and starting from the reporter dominic 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.690
 share in the late 1990's 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.390
 years has actually crept in 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.860
 religion culture in england from where this 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.720
 phenomenon originally comes already 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.069
 The 70s 80s there a lot 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.110
 has lived in the so-called third 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.110
 halftime of the fight after the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 football match of provocations of 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.380
 fireworks in the stadium to very much 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.300
 severe physical injury motto 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.950
 and everything that goes with it and in fact 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.330
 after it became known and he was in 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.100
 English television reports about it 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.510
 What he has undercover for several years 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.550
 his family was threatened 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.180
 his wife was beaten up and that 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.280
 whole is here a big big star 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.269
 great part in this documentation and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.640
 very exciting and interesting 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.230
 made and overall deals 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.880
 this documentary level is the fan culture of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.769
 hooligans where does that come from ? 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.180
 exists and how it is on the whole 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.800
 world is not just busy in england 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.810
 no, also in Germany and Russia in 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.299
 europe in general in eastern europe though 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.890
 also in south america where it is in argentina 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.450
 then at some point so far 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.890
 that people are just still 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.690
 hurt each other and also the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.130
 players regularly threaten the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.450
 really only scared for 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.799
 to play Argentine clubs 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.870
 that's why a player like tevez or 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.850
 messi never in argentinian clubs 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.320
 would see play and that is for everyone 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.970
 Sports enthusiasts maybe one 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.980
 interesting documentation especially in 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 direction football of course or for everyone 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.459
 wondering how can something like that arise 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.780
 I think it's good that these too 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.910
 documentation makes a difference 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.709
 between quiet to the general and 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.660
 cases also ultra communities the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.850
 turn positive 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.109
 For clubs that are often negatively prescribed 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.459
 but are actually very organized 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.019
 Groupings can be for the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.340
 fan-culture and that I have one here 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.769
 makes small cut in between and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.299
 not only draws black and white though 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.410
 I'm fine, which is a pity 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.150
 that I overload that and 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.470
 violent scenes and far too little 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.269
 background has spoken in the original 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.700
 will like the votes of sean bean 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.109
 incidentally, probably the whole room is touched 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.430
 a doku you can get a two times 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.780
 then she will look a bit too 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.549
 boring if you're honest then how 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.140
 said here is a little too little 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.790
 feedback behind it but rather the whole 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.079
 very very describe secret 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.819
 through the decades like the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.349
 but I want to develop 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.989
 In general, I personally tense as 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.849
 Actors currently do not shoot much 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.810
 have always been in evil and also roll 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.340
 a few times actually hooligans 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.810
 played and therefore also books 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.090
 I have read about it again and again 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.470
 to find exciting to understand 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.879
 what goes on in the mind and the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.609
 mentally ill people partially 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.199
 are and how scary that too 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.850
 for many people is and how so 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.770
 Bypass in germany and 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.110
 also have to deal with prices in stadiums 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.000
 to increase just such kind of 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.860
 Fans stay out of the stadiums 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.509
 exciting interesting topic yours 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.310
 Opinion interests me totally and 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.750
 if he will see bad docu I will 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.979
 I did not know you had one 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.599
 comes out one am very glad that they with 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.490
 sent environment has a fast 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.380
 look to it a really 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.880
 successful thing a special topic 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.770
 and I hope it interests one 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.910
 or other of you if not too 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.440
 not as bad tomorrow there's now 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.389
 certainly a new criticism and today 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.979
 later a trailer check so already 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.509
 after that and over again 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.400
 documentation is not subject to me 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.509
 evaluation but still they are you 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.280
 a small one I put to heart 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.740
 Otherwise, as I said tomorrow 15 o'clock 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.870
 new video and load of my mother in it 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.310
 my video to hooligans radio listening 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.110
 was really bad 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.210
 otherwise I hope you are tomorrow 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.210
 of course again at 3
