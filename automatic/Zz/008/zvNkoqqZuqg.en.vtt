00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
there's low light but there's a piece of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.130 
there's low light but there's a piece of
metal<00:03:00.640> here<00:03:00.970> that's<00:03:01.150> part<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.600> frame<00:03:01.990> of

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
metal here that's part of the frame of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.699 
metal here that's part of the frame of
the<00:03:02.230> car<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.720> car<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:04.930> really<00:03:05.230> dirty<00:03:05.470> on

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
the car and the car is really dirty on

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.290 
the car and the car is really dirty on
the<00:03:05.830> underside<00:03:06.280> but<00:03:06.490> there's<00:03:06.730> actually<00:03:06.970> an

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
the underside but there's actually an

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.170 
the underside but there's actually an
arrow<00:03:07.720> pointing<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.160> little<00:03:09.850> piece<00:03:10.030> of

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
arrow pointing to this little piece of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.610 
arrow pointing to this little piece of
metal<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.980> basically<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.100> slide<00:03:12.790> your<00:03:13.030> jack

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
right under that spot you start jacking

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.080 
right under that spot you start jacking
from<00:03:16.810> from<00:03:17.739> there<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.560> I've<00:03:21.010> also<00:03:21.310> got<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.610> jack

almost a review on the jack as well I
find<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.049> it's<00:04:11.230> really<00:04:11.500> smooth

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
find that it's really smooth

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.830 
find that it's really smooth
and<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:14.209> don't<00:04:14.330> have<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.540> put<00:04:14.690> too<00:04:14.720> much

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
and you don't have to put too much

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.110 
and you don't have to put too much
effort<00:04:15.170> into<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.800> so<00:04:16.160> we're<00:04:16.579> also<00:04:16.700> just<00:04:16.940> going

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
effort into it so we're also just going

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.150 
effort into it so we're also just going
to<00:04:17.209> slide<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.510> jack<00:04:18.019> stand<00:04:18.049> underneath<00:04:18.680> for

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
to slide a jack stand underneath for

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.810 
to slide a jack stand underneath for
secondary<00:04:20.150> safety<00:04:20.660> measure<00:04:21.550> so<00:04:22.550> now<00:04:22.760> that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
secondary safety measure so now that

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.360 
secondary safety measure so now that
we've<00:04:23.150> got<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.600> car<00:04:24.050> raised<00:04:24.590> I'm<00:04:25.040> just<00:04:25.220> going

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
we've got the car raised I'm just going

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.170 
we've got the car raised I'm just going
to<00:04:25.430> take<00:04:25.580> my<00:04:25.760> airgun<00:04:26.300> add<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.230> boat's<00:04:28.180> air

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
to take my airgun add to the boat's air

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.340 
to take my airgun add to the boat's air
tools<00:04:29.540> just<00:04:29.870> make<00:04:30.080> life<00:04:30.500> so<00:04:30.980> much<00:04:31.540> quicker<00:04:32.540> if

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
tools just make life so much quicker if

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.080 
tools just make life so much quicker if
you<00:04:33.590> try<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.889> do<00:04:34.100> this<00:04:34.250> by<00:04:34.430> hand

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
you try to do this by hand

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.940 
you try to do this by hand
you'll<00:04:35.210> probably<00:04:35.450> get<00:04:35.720> tired<00:04:35.990> by<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.889> time

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
you'll probably get tired by the time

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.830 
you'll probably get tired by the time
you've<00:04:37.280> done<00:04:37.430> all<00:04:37.610> four<00:04:38.090> wheels<00:04:38.330> but

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
you've done all four wheels but

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.340 
you've done all four wheels but
certainly<00:04:39.560> they're<00:04:39.919> a<00:04:39.950> gun<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.850> don't<00:04:41.350> so

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
certainly they're a gun you don't so

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.890 
certainly they're a gun you don't so
these<00:04:42.530> are<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.270> wheel<00:04:44.270> hangers<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.780> was

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
these are the wheel hangers I was

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.210 
these are the wheel hangers I was
talking<00:04:45.169> about<00:04:45.200> earlier

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
talking about earlier

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.850 
talking about earlier
they<00:04:46.580> make<00:04:46.850> taking<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.510> wheel<00:04:47.720> off<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.470> lot

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
they make taking the wheel off a lot

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.909 
they make taking the wheel off a lot
easier<00:04:49.250> but<00:04:50.150> more<00:04:50.330> importantly<00:04:50.780> they<00:04:51.620> make

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
easier but more importantly they make

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.790 
easier but more importantly they make
putting<00:04:52.310> on<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.730> new<00:04:52.880> wheel<00:04:53.800> obviously

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
putting on the new wheel obviously

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.100 
putting on the new wheel obviously
easier<00:04:55.130> as<00:04:55.280> well<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.760> remember<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.690> first<00:04:56.900> time

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
easier as well I remember the first time

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.850 
easier as well I remember the first time
I<00:04:57.169> took<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.740> tires<00:04:58.130> off<00:04:58.430> my<00:04:58.780> 987<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.530> didn't

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
I took the tires off my 987 and I didn't

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.320 
I took the tires off my 987 and I didn't
have<00:05:00.980> wheel<00:05:01.250> hangers<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.820> didn't<00:05:02.000> even<00:05:02.120> know

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
have wheel hangers I didn't even know

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.620 
have wheel hangers I didn't even know
about<00:05:02.480> wheel<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.590> was<00:05:03.710> actually<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:05.390> took

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
about wheel it was actually and it took

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.990 
about wheel it was actually and it took
me<00:05:05.840> pretty<00:05:06.290> much<00:05:06.470> half<00:05:07.160> an<00:05:07.370> hour<00:05:07.490> just<00:05:07.610> to<00:05:07.850> get

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
me pretty much half an hour just to get

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.950 
me pretty much half an hour just to get
one<00:05:08.330> wheel<00:05:08.810> back<00:05:09.260> on<00:05:09.530> because<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:10.070> had<00:05:10.490> to

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
one wheel back on because I had to

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.659 
one wheel back on because I had to
position<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.320> know<00:05:12.440> with<00:05:12.919> my<00:05:13.160> with<00:05:13.430> one

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
position it you know with my with one

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.560 
position it you know with my with one
hand<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.360> use<00:05:14.840> another<00:05:14.990> hand<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.880> put<00:05:17.450> the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
hand and use another hand to to put the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.300 
hand and use another hand to to put the
bolts<00:05:17.870> in<00:05:18.020> but<00:05:18.320> as<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:18.530> can<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.250> just

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
bolts in but as you can see it just

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.040 
bolts in but as you can see it just
comes<00:05:20.060> off<00:05:20.270> really<00:05:20.720> easy<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:23.210> now<00:05:23.390> let's<00:05:23.810> put

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
comes off really easy so now let's put

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.360 
comes off really easy so now let's put
that<00:05:24.320> summer<00:05:25.100> tire<00:05:25.550> on<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.500> basically<00:05:28.130> I'm

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
that summer tire on so basically I'm

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.969 
that summer tire on so basically I'm
just<00:05:28.430> going<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.789> line<00:05:29.030> up<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.210> two<00:05:29.479> holes<00:05:29.979> with

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
just going to line up the two holes with

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.310 
just going to line up the two holes with
the<00:05:31.250> wheel<00:05:31.610> hangers<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.270> I'm<00:05:32.930> just<00:05:33.140> going<00:05:33.289> to

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
the wheel hangers and I'm just going to

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.890 
the wheel hangers and I'm just going to
slide<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.740> in<00:05:34.180> one<00:05:35.180> thing<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.539> want<00:05:35.690> to<00:05:35.780> make

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
slide it in one thing you want to make

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.969 
slide it in one thing you want to make
sure<00:05:35.930> right<00:05:36.530> now<00:05:36.560> just<00:05:36.979> make<00:05:37.130> sure<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.460> wheel

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
sure right now just make sure the wheel

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.640 
sure right now just make sure the wheel
sits<00:05:39.979> nice<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.400> flush<00:05:41.140> you<00:05:42.140> don't<00:05:42.320> want<00:05:42.500> any

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
sits nice and flush you don't want any

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.540 
sits nice and flush you don't want any
gaps<00:05:43.510> so<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.630> car<00:05:44.840> is<00:05:44.960> still<00:05:45.260> raised<00:05:45.890> right

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
gaps so the car is still raised right

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.060 
gaps so the car is still raised right
now<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:47.060> I'm<00:05:48.050> just<00:05:48.140> going<00:05:48.350> to<00:05:48.410> put<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.740> bolts

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
now and I'm just going to put the bolts

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.460 
now and I'm just going to put the bolts
back<00:05:49.160> in<00:05:49.780> I'm<00:05:50.780> just<00:05:50.930> going<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.080> pretty<00:05:51.380> much

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
back in I'm just going to pretty much

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.210 
back in I'm just going to pretty much
finger<00:05:52.010> type<00:05:52.640> them<00:05:52.970> at<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.169> moment<00:05:54.560> so<00:05:55.190> I

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
finger type them at the moment so I

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.640 
finger type them at the moment so I
won't<00:05:55.550> really<00:05:55.729> be<00:05:55.970> tightening<00:05:56.510> them<00:05:56.720> to<00:05:57.500> the

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
won't really be tightening them to the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.070 
won't really be tightening them to the
to<00:05:57.830> its<00:05:58.010> fullest<00:05:58.400> until<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.479> car<00:06:00.050> is

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
to its fullest until the car is

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.170 
to its fullest until the car is
obviously<00:06:00.650> lowered<00:06:01.070> so<00:06:01.700> we're<00:06:01.880> just<00:06:01.910> going<00:06:02.090> to

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
obviously lowered so we're just going to

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.620 
obviously lowered so we're just going to
go<00:06:02.539> ahead<00:06:02.690> put<00:06:03.080> all<00:06:03.200> the<00:06:03.320> bolts<00:06:03.650> in<00:06:03.830> and<00:06:04.630> again

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
go ahead put all the bolts in and again

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.930 
go ahead put all the bolts in and again
with<00:06:06.260> the<00:06:06.590> wheel<00:06:06.860> hangers<00:06:07.340> holding<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:07.760> wheel

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
with the wheel hangers holding the wheel

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.610 
with the wheel hangers holding the wheel
up<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:09.320> bolts<00:06:09.860> line<00:06:10.130> in<00:06:10.340> real<00:06:10.850> nice<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.620> it's

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
up the bolts line in real nice and it's

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.170 
up the bolts line in real nice and it's
it's<00:06:12.890> pretty<00:06:13.010> much<00:06:13.250> a<00:06:13.280> no-brainer<00:06:13.520> at<00:06:14.030> this

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
it's pretty much a no-brainer at this

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.980 
it's pretty much a no-brainer at this
point<00:06:15.340> again<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.370> can't<00:06:16.729> stress<00:06:16.880> enough<00:06:17.210> that

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
point again I can't stress enough that

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.300 
point again I can't stress enough that
you<00:06:18.140> really<00:06:18.440> if<00:06:18.620> you're<00:06:19.010> a<00:06:19.039> do-it-yourselfer

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
you really if you're a do-it-yourselfer

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.430 
you really if you're a do-it-yourselfer
you<00:06:20.120> really<00:06:20.479> need<00:06:20.660> these<00:06:21.010> these

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
you really need these these

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.680 
you really need these these
wheel<00:06:22.620> hangers<00:06:23.040> you<00:06:23.520> can<00:06:23.670> imagine<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:24.240> 20

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
wheel hangers you can imagine the 20

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.810 
wheel hangers you can imagine the 20
inch<00:06:24.840> tires<00:06:25.200> are<00:06:25.470> really<00:06:25.740> heavy<00:06:25.950> so<00:06:26.580> if<00:06:26.700> you

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
inch tires are really heavy so if you

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.600 
inch tires are really heavy so if you
were<00:06:26.940> doing<00:06:27.180> this<00:06:27.300> yourself<00:06:27.950> it'd<00:06:28.950> almost<00:06:29.400> be

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
were doing this yourself it'd almost be

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.070 
were doing this yourself it'd almost be
impossible<00:06:29.700> because<00:06:30.390> you're<00:06:30.600> going<00:06:30.690> to<00:06:30.780> have

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
impossible because you're going to have

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.350 
impossible because you're going to have
to<00:06:31.290> balance<00:06:31.500> the<00:06:31.890> run<00:06:32.070> wheel<00:06:32.340> on<00:06:32.580> on<00:06:32.850> your<00:06:33.090> body

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
to balance the run wheel on on your body

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.100 
to balance the run wheel on on your body
and<00:06:33.750> you<00:06:34.080> know<00:06:34.200> use<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:34.680> other<00:06:34.980> hand<00:06:35.280> to<00:06:36.110> to

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
and you know use the other hand to to

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.560 
and you know use the other hand to to
put<00:06:37.290> the<00:06:37.470> bolts<00:06:38.190> back<00:06:38.250> in<00:06:38.430> but<00:06:38.940> as<00:06:39.060> you<00:06:39.180> can<00:06:39.300> see

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
put the bolts back in but as you can see

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.160 
put the bolts back in but as you can see
this<00:06:40.200> is<00:06:40.410> not<00:06:40.530> even<00:06:40.710> taking<00:06:41.780> it's<00:06:42.780> not<00:06:42.930> even

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
this is not even taking it's not even

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.320 
this is not even taking it's not even
taking<00:06:43.440> two<00:06:43.590> minutes<00:06:43.740> and<00:06:44.190> I've<00:06:44.370> got<00:06:44.640> almost

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
taking two minutes and I've got almost

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.450 
taking two minutes and I've got almost
all<00:06:45.510> the<00:06:45.630> bolts<00:06:45.900> back<00:06:46.110> on<00:06:46.350> so<00:06:46.710> here<00:06:47.010> is<00:06:47.190> the

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
all the bolts back on so here is the

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.490 
all the bolts back on so here is the
last<00:06:47.610> one<00:06:47.850> that<00:06:48.270> one<00:06:48.960> has<00:06:49.200> the<00:06:49.230> lock<00:06:50.190> nut<00:06:50.460> on<00:06:50.490> it

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
last one that one has the lock nut on it

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.650 
last one that one has the lock nut on it
once<00:06:52.500> all<00:06:52.710> the<00:06:52.830> bolts<00:06:53.010> are<00:06:53.280> on<00:06:53.460> it's<00:06:53.880> time<00:06:54.360> to

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
once all the bolts are on it's time to

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.430 
once all the bolts are on it's time to
remove<00:06:54.930> the<00:06:55.200> jack<00:06:55.470> stand<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:57.660> remove<00:06:58.260> the

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
remove the jack stand and to remove the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.940 
remove the jack stand and to remove the
jack

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
jack

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.280 
jack
so<00:06:59.130> we're<00:06:59.280> just<00:06:59.400> going<00:06:59.520> to<00:06:59.550> lower<00:06:59.790> the<00:07:00.000> car

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290 
so we're just going to lower the car

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.340 
so we're just going to lower the car
nice<00:07:01.290> and<00:07:01.320> slow<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.330> now<00:07:03.330> we<00:07:03.390> can<00:07:03.840> tighten<00:07:04.140> the

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
nice and slow and now we can tighten the

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:11.230 
nice and slow and now we can tighten the
bolts<00:07:05.090> so<00:07:06.090> the<00:07:06.660> manual<00:07:07.260> for<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.710> 13<00:07:09.080> 981<00:07:10.080> says

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
bolts so the manual for the 13 981 says

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.830 
bolts so the manual for the 13 981 says
118<00:07:12.240> pound<00:07:12.540> feet<00:07:13.370> so<00:07:14.370> that<00:07:14.400> differs<00:07:15.330> slightly

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
118 pound feet so that differs slightly

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.170 
118 pound feet so that differs slightly
from<00:07:16.170> the<00:07:16.650> 986<00:07:17.430> 987<00:07:18.590> that<00:07:19.590> was<00:07:19.830> at<00:07:20.040> I<00:07:20.520> think<00:07:21.060> was

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
from the 986 987 that was at I think was

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.530 
from the 986 987 that was at I think was
97<00:07:21.900> pound<00:07:22.440> feet<00:07:22.770> or<00:07:23.130> 92<00:07:23.670> I<00:07:23.700> can't<00:07:24.030> remember<00:07:24.300> one

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
97 pound feet or 92 I can't remember one

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.290 
97 pound feet or 92 I can't remember one
or<00:07:24.630> the<00:07:24.720> other<00:07:25.010> but<00:07:26.010> anyways<00:07:26.340> just<00:07:26.910> make<00:07:27.060> sure

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
or the other but anyways just make sure

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.400 
or the other but anyways just make sure
you<00:07:27.510> go<00:07:27.750> in<00:07:28.020> a<00:07:28.200> star<00:07:28.710> pattern<00:07:29.750> and<00:07:30.750> with<00:07:31.290> the

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
you go in a star pattern and with the

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.040 
you go in a star pattern and with the
torque<00:07:31.710> wrench<00:07:31.950> you<00:07:32.790> just<00:07:33.120> want<00:07:33.330> to<00:07:33.419> get<00:07:33.780> it<00:07:33.930> to

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
torque wrench you just want to get it to

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.180 
torque wrench you just want to get it to
the<00:07:34.140> point<00:07:34.410> where<00:07:34.560> you<00:07:34.650> hear<00:07:34.800> the<00:07:34.950> torque

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
the point where you hear the torque

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.490 
the point where you hear the torque
wrench<00:07:35.370> click<00:07:35.820> so<00:07:36.510> the<00:07:36.630> moment<00:07:36.990> you<00:07:37.050> hear<00:07:37.260> that

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
wrench click so the moment you hear that

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.240 
wrench click so the moment you hear that
one<00:07:38.430> click<00:07:39.110> you're<00:07:40.110> just<00:07:40.290> going<00:07:40.410> to<00:07:40.440> go<00:07:40.650> on<00:07:40.680> to

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250 
one click you're just going to go on to

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.300 
one click you're just going to go on to
the<00:07:41.430> the<00:07:41.460> next<00:07:42.270> bolt<00:07:42.510> so<00:07:43.320> once<00:07:43.590> you<00:07:43.830> do<00:07:44.040> all<00:07:44.070> the

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 
the the next bolt so once you do all the

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.909 
the the next bolt so once you do all the
bolts<00:07:44.669> that's<00:07:45.360> it<00:07:45.690> you've<00:07:45.960> done<00:07:45.990> that<00:07:46.620> one

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 
bolts that's it you've done that one

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.270 
bolts that's it you've done that one
tire<00:07:47.280> and<00:07:47.630> you<00:07:48.630> got<00:07:48.990> it<00:07:49.110> you<00:07:49.380> got<00:07:49.410> to<00:07:49.650> go<00:07:49.740> and<00:07:49.919> do

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 
tire and you got it you got to go and do

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.450 
tire and you got it you got to go and do
the<00:07:50.400> other<00:07:50.430> three<00:07:51.830> thirty<00:07:52.830> minutes<00:07:53.220> later

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460
