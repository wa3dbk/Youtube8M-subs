 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.930
 Today I am making green iced tea tea and bubble tea. 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 First, in a bowl add in 1 ملعقة teaspoon of Matcha, green tea powder, 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.960
 And 2 tablespoons of hot water. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.370
 And stir until dissolved. 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.370
 Green brewed tea can also be used but Matcha has its own distinctive flavor and taste. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 So I recommend to use Matcha. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.000
 In Shaker in adding Matcha mixture, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 2 tablespoons of acacia honey, 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 1 cup of milk 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.410
 And كوب cup of ice cubes 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.620
 And shake well. 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 Or you can also use a water bottle with a wide mouth instead of a shaker. 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.910
 Now pour in a cup of service. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 It is excellent with 2 scoops of high quality green tea ice cream. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 You can also make bubble tea just adding about 1/4 cup of giant black tapioca pearl. 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.930
 Check out my latest video, how to cook a chewy yummy. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.830
 Then you will need fat straw instead of a regular one. 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.120
 Bon appetite. 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.120
 I really liked the ice-green Ette tea especially in the hot summer. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 Eugenie was a kitchen. thanks for watching. Bye for now.
