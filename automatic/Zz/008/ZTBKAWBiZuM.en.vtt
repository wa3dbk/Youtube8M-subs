00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 It's all good stuff for those who do not like me. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.049
 You know just the leg. 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.630
 Welcome, everyone. Welcome. 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.539
 Our channel, I 'm here to do with 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.260
 You're beautiful, the sea is all over. 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.080
 produced in disposable spoons which is 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.939
 amazing is a quick easy tip and you 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.939
 may cause women who have been 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.579
 then it 's super cheap you 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.370
 can do in the colors you want me 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.280
 I used spray paint to finish 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 but you can use silver paint enamel and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.180
 which makes it possible to make 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.670
 Colors 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.469
 so if you want to learn, come with me. 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.469
 Let's do it together. 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.550
 is to make our maxicolar of spoons 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.690
 We're going to need 15 scoops. 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.330
 plastic 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.490
 I'm wearing some white but it's 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.230
 because the red ones do not color 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.650
 will influence why we're going to paint 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.070
 then okay, or any tape that does not 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.960
 have elasticity we'll cut and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.790
 the small hot glue scissors articles 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 chains a hoop and 1 closed pliers it 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.760
 spray paint in the color of your choice I 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.730
 I will use metallic gold and a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.620
 Employee, let's start, let's go. 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:53.100
 cut the spoon by separating the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.110
 handle and then we'll part the Valar 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.870
 of the spoon that has remained and the spoon will 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.720
 so we'll repeat the same process 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.910
 with 15 women are the 15 pieces 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.740
 cut we will position our 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.470
 school we're going to put first 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.040
 row 5 piece 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.190
 in the second row four pieces in the 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.810
 third row three pieces I'm 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.030
 putting the whiteness will become a 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.960
 a little harder to see but 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.970
 is in the fourth row two pieces and 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.100
 in the last syllable one piece 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.530
 Good guys, now, let's go, let's go. 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.530
 use one-and-a-half centimeters 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.230
 two cut out of a tape without 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.470
 elasticity I cut some strips 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.750
 larger for the top spoons some 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.510
 more thinly strips I cut the s 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.850
 middle for the bass strips and now 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.220
 We're going to start gluing the spoons. 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.640
 are positioned with the concave part 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.200
 up that part will be in the afternoon makes the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.170
 maxi necklace ok 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.140
 I put glue here on tape and I'll put a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.450
 reap the other then stayed like this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.500
 now I'm joining the second on the third 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.500
 and so on 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.480
 pieces glued to the front row of maxi 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.209
 necklace is in order 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.819
 now we are going to set up the monday 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.819
 we'll take two strips rolled z 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.900
 let's stick on the spoon 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.850
 and even that one stayed there if now we go 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.610
 this part between the first and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.950
 second spoon nothing strip will be glued on 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.810
 one of the spoons then one in the first 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.510
 one on the second if you find more 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.210
 you can position the spoon and 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.110
 paste the strips straight into the 100 spoon 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.540
 informal 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.850
 remember to always leave this tape 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.400
 I kissed her so she would not stay 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.240
 appearing on the front side of the collar 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.540
 Okay, let's repeat this process every 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.540
 spoons 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.910
 we will now turn to this for 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.340
 make the holes where they will use the holes 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.370
 chains we're going to use a predinho 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.660
 Let's hold with pliers and let's go 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.330
 warm the edge in the novel 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.200
 we will stick back and forth 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.640
 back and let's repeat the same 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:46.530
 process on the other side does not put at risk 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.960
 I already placed it here, it was already mine. 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.450
 table and now we will achieve 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.130
 I'm going to use this metallic gold paint 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.130
 I'll go through the collar 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.490
 now then let me dry for a few 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.890
 minutes and I'm coming back to finish with you 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.040
 this drought now just put using the 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.290
 holes to learn the chains 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.510
 I used the pliers to help 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.510
 work as you can see the image 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.190
 in the golden part I left the chain one 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.970
 little bigger 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.340
 so I did not have to put the goldfish 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.440
 but in this black part the current is lower 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.480
 so I put the snippet 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.500
 these details are totally yours 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.500
 ok criterion 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.330
 good staff then this was the result 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:58.000
 At the end I hope you have liked 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.409

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.050

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.479
 disclosure is inscribed on the channel so that 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.940
 lose any more update agents 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.159

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.259
 still does not respond to comments from 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.900
 I'm super messed up with the 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.780
 my tasks super disorganized but 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.240

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.530
 calmly answer calmly then 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.229
 This does not answer yet. 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.990
