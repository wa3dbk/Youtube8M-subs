these<00:01:06.940> little<00:01:07.870> things<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:09.340> create<00:01:09.910> big

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
these little things can create big

these little things can create big
problems<00:01:10.300> for<00:01:11.200> people<00:01:11.440> walking<00:01:12.430> down<00:01:12.640> the

problems for people walking down the
stairs<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.270> should<00:01:13.810> not<00:01:14.080> be<00:01:14.380> there<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.100> there

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
stairs and should not be there and there

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.240 
stairs and should not be there and there
are<00:01:15.910> certain<00:01:16.420> building<00:01:16.870> codes<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.470> will<00:01:17.890> not

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
are certain building codes that will not

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.990 
are certain building codes that will not
allow<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.230> to<00:01:20.230> build<00:01:20.830> your<00:01:20.980> hand<00:01:21.370> rails<00:01:21.670> like

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
allow you to build your hand rails like

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.130 
allow you to build your hand rails like
these<00:01:22.300> or<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.870> even<00:01:23.080> have<00:01:24.060> items<00:01:25.140> protruding

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
these or to even have items protruding

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.640 
these or to even have items protruding
into<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:27.160> stairway<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:28.090> from<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.600> wall<00:01:29.230> or

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
into the stairway like from the wall or

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.300 
into the stairway like from the wall or
from<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.610> handrail<00:01:31.330> so<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.710> know<00:01:32.830> something

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
from the handrail so you know something

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.640 
from the handrail so you know something
like<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.910> was<00:01:34.150> probably<00:01:34.300> built<00:01:34.690> without<00:01:34.990> a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
like this was probably built without a

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.690 
like this was probably built without a
building<00:01:36.490> code<00:01:37.200> building<00:01:38.200> inspector<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:39.550> was

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
building code building inspector it was

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.490 
building code building inspector it was
never<00:01:39.880> approved<00:01:40.090> by<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.600> city<00:01:40.870> maybe<00:01:41.200> they

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
never approved by the city maybe they

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.100 
never approved by the city maybe they
just<00:01:41.530> rebuilt<00:01:42.190> it<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:43.480> was<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.840> end<00:01:43.870> of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
just rebuilt it and that was the end of

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.700 
just rebuilt it and that was the end of
that<00:01:44.170> but<00:01:44.860> i<00:01:45.690> doubt<00:01:46.690> if<00:01:46.930> something<00:01:47.290> like<00:01:47.440> this

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
that but i doubt if something like this

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.100 
that but i doubt if something like this
would<00:01:48.610> have<00:01:48.730> been<00:01:48.760> approved<00:01:49.240> within<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.870> past

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
would have been approved within the past

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.070 
would have been approved within the past
five<00:01:50.530> years<00:01:50.980> if<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.520> was<00:01:51.700> built<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.750> would

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
five years if it was built that would

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.800 
five years if it was built that would
shock<00:01:53.380> me<00:01:53.440> I'm<00:01:53.830> not<00:01:54.040> saying<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.430> impossible

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
shock me I'm not saying it's impossible

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.100 
shock me I'm not saying it's impossible
but<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:56.080> would<00:01:56.409> shock<00:01:56.979> me<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:58.780> what<00:01:59.080> about

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
but it would shock me now what about

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.980 
but it would shock me now what about
this<00:01:59.740> picture<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.820> wall<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.180> don't<00:02:01.810> think

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
this picture on the wall I don't think

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.380 
this picture on the wall I don't think
something<00:02:02.770> like<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.220> would<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> problem

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
something like this would be a problem

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.119 
something like this would be a problem
as<00:02:04.890> long<00:02:05.890> as<00:02:06.430> there<00:02:07.210> isn't<00:02:07.420> any<00:02:07.870> glass<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.709> it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
as long as there isn't any glass in it

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.040 
as long as there isn't any glass in it
so<00:02:09.789> again<00:02:10.499> if<00:02:11.499> pitcher<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.159> this<00:02:12.189> you<00:02:12.459> know

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
so again if pitcher like this you know

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.850 
so again if pitcher like this you know
you<00:02:13.140> get<00:02:13.320> hooked<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.740> yeah<00:02:14.250> trust<00:02:14.790> me<00:02:15.860> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
you get hooked on it yeah trust me you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.350 
you get hooked on it yeah trust me you
could<00:02:17.130> there's<00:02:17.340> actually<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> light<00:02:18.060> switch

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
could there's actually a light switch

people get hooked on this stuff and when
you<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.440> hooked<00:02:31.710> on<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.370> will<00:02:32.580> stop<00:02:33.000> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
course there is a possibility of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.390 
course there is a possibility of
actually<00:02:39.900> falling<00:02:40.650> down<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.040> stairs<00:02:41.280> and
