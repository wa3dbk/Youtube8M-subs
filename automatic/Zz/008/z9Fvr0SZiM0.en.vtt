00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
experience with the hair the only

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.340 
experience with the hair the only
downfall<00:06:09.250> of<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:09.820> hair<00:06:10.060> is<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.510> it<00:06:10.630> does<00:06:10.930> get

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
downfall of the hair is that it does get

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.550 
downfall of the hair is that it does get
dry<00:06:11.710> make<00:06:12.550> sure<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:13.030> you<00:06:13.510> are<00:06:13.720> on<00:06:14.050> which<00:06:14.380> to

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
rising your hair you do have to make

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.960 
rising your hair you do have to make
sure<00:06:16.360> that<00:06:16.720> you're<00:06:16.930> on<00:06:17.310> putting<00:06:18.310> some<00:06:18.490> oil<00:06:18.790> in

it to keep it from getting dry that

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.290 
it to keep it from getting dry that
would<00:06:20.920> be<00:06:20.980> my<00:06:21.100> only<00:06:21.280> downfall<00:06:21.640> for<00:06:21.850> the<00:06:22.090> hair

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
would be my only downfall for the hair

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.590
