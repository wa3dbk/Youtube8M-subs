look at the Platina hyperdrive snorkel

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.790 
look at the Platina hyperdrive snorkel
possibly<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.880> finest<00:00:11.360> snorkel<00:00:11.900> available

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
possibly the finest snorkel available

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.870 
possibly the finest snorkel available
today<00:00:13.060> let's<00:00:14.060> take<00:00:14.210> a<00:00:14.269> closer<00:00:14.570> look<00:00:15.670> so<00:00:16.670> what's

snorkel<00:00:19.189> let's<00:00:19.789> start<00:00:20.029> from<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.269> top<00:00:20.380> you

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
snorkel let's start from the top you

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.829 
snorkel let's start from the top you
have<00:00:21.499> a<00:00:21.589> wave<00:00:22.130> deflector<00:00:22.730> any<00:00:23.029> water<00:00:23.720> that

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
have a wave deflector any water that

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.839 
have a wave deflector any water that
comes<00:00:24.169> over<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.529> top<00:00:24.769> of<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.009> snorkel<00:00:25.550> is

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
comes over the top of the snorkel is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.089 
comes over the top of the snorkel is
caught<00:00:26.269> by<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.539> wave<00:00:26.810> deflector<00:00:27.409> and<00:00:27.589> just

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
caught by the wave deflector and just

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.460 
caught by the wave deflector and just
drains<00:00:28.400> out<00:00:28.669> before<00:00:29.060> it<00:00:29.149> goes<00:00:29.300> down<00:00:29.659> the<00:00:30.289> air

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470

the corrugation is on the outside on the
inside<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:17.330> problem<00:01:17.780> with<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.440> that<00:01:18.740> air

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
inside the problem with that is that air

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.780 
inside the problem with that is that air
has<00:01:20.620> disturbances<00:01:21.620> all<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.130> way<00:01:22.310> down<00:01:22.580> that

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
has disturbances all the way down that

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.940 
has disturbances all the way down that
section<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.450> tube<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:23.960> that's<00:01:24.410> magnified

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
section of the tube and that's magnified

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.190 
section of the tube and that's magnified
when<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.430> tube<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.790> bent<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.360> with<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.930> being

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
when the tube is bent so with that being

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.440 
when the tube is bent so with that being
smooth<00:01:27.560> on<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.890> inside<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.910> means<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
smooth on the inside it means that the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.690 
smooth on the inside it means that the
air<00:01:29.690> flow<00:01:30.050> through<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.380> snorkel<00:01:30.830> is<00:01:31.010> much

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
air flow through the snorkel is much

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.090 
air flow through the snorkel is much
improved<00:01:32.200> let's<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:33.380> fit<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.650> back<00:01:33.890> onto

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
improved let's just fit this back onto

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.820 
improved let's just fit this back onto
here

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

the<00:01:44.830> mouthpiece<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.550> snorkel<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:48.820> a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
the mouthpiece of the snorkel has a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.930 
the mouthpiece of the snorkel has a
detachable<00:01:49.800> mouthpiece<00:01:50.800> which<00:01:51.400> again<00:01:51.730> is

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
detachable mouthpiece which again is

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.940 
detachable mouthpiece which again is
replaceable<00:01:52.510> should<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.260> ever<00:01:53.410> bite<00:01:53.710> through

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
replaceable should you ever bite through

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.400 
replaceable should you ever bite through
these<00:01:54.190> lugs<00:01:54.490> then<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.840> can<00:01:55.990> just<00:01:56.200> buy<00:01:56.380> a

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
these lugs then you can just buy a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.200 
these lugs then you can just buy a
replacement<00:01:56.830> mouthpiece<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.670> just<00:01:57.850> pushes

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
replacement mouthpiece that just pushes

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
replacement mouthpiece that just pushes
on<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:59.620> seals<00:01:59.920> completely<00:02:00.580> on<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.810> bottom

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
on and seals completely on the bottom

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.310 
on and seals completely on the bottom
the<00:02:02.350> snorkel<00:02:02.800> is<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.490> drain<00:02:03.940> valve<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:05.080> when

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the snorkel is a drain valve so when

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.840 
the snorkel is a drain valve so when
you're<00:02:05.500> snorkeling<00:02:05.800> with<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.370> or<00:02:06.580> diving

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
you're snorkeling with this or diving

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.880 
you're snorkeling with this or diving
with<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.870> just<00:02:08.020> put<00:02:08.260> it<00:02:08.380> into<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.740> mouth

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
with it you just put it into your mouth

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.850 
with it you just put it into your mouth
you<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.610> make<00:02:09.760> a<00:02:09.790> putt<00:02:10.420> sound<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.380> all<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
you just make a putt sound and all the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.770 
you just make a putt sound and all the
water<00:02:12.190> from<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.610> entire<00:02:12.940> snorkel<00:02:13.420> will<00:02:13.510> drain

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
water from the entire snorkel will drain

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.780 
water from the entire snorkel will drain
out<00:02:13.810> through<00:02:14.020> here<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.340> probably<00:02:15.460> one<00:02:15.760> of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
out through here this is probably one of

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.460 
out through here this is probably one of
the<00:02:15.880> most<00:02:16.060> efficient<00:02:16.690> snorkels<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:17.350> this

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the most efficient snorkels for this

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.850 
the most efficient snorkels for this
because<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.430> sits<00:02:18.820> at<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.150> lowest<00:02:19.570> place

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
because that sits at the lowest place

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.160 
because that sits at the lowest place
when<00:02:20.860> it's<00:02:20.980> in<00:02:21.100> your<00:02:21.250> mouth<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.990> water

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
when it's in your mouth all of the water

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.050 
when it's in your mouth all of the water
goes<00:02:23.620> out<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.010> don't<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.400> left<00:02:24.610> with<00:02:24.760> any

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
goes out you don't get left with any

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.180 
goes out you don't get left with any
tiny<00:02:25.420> little<00:02:25.720> droplets<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.410> water<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.980> there

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
tiny little droplets of water in there

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.780 
tiny little droplets of water in there
completely<00:02:28.180> dry<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:29.010> very<00:02:30.010> good<00:02:30.310> snorkel

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
completely dry a very good snorkel

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.830 
completely dry a very good snorkel
possibly<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.720> best<00:02:31.900> snorkel<00:02:32.350> available
