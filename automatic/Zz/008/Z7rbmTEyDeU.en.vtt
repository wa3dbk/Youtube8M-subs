that<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.750> used<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.140> rust-oleum<00:00:40.559> kit<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.250> do

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that they used a rust-oleum kit to do

that a paint kit and something that they
did<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.520> helps<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
did that I really think helps the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
did that I really think helps the
kitchen<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.660> added<00:00:46.079> crown<00:00:46.440> molding<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
kitchen is they added crown molding to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
kitchen is they added crown molding to
the<00:00:47.280> cabinet<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> gives<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.690> really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the cabinet so it gives it that really

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
the cabinet so it gives it that really
custom<00:00:49.530> look<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.160> inexpensive<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
custom look but it was inexpensive and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
custom look but it was inexpensive and
then<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.449> painted<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.320> color<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
then they painted it all one color so it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
then they painted it all one color so it
looked<00:00:53.280> uniform<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> something<00:00:54.750> else<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.260> did

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
looked uniform and something else we did

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
looked uniform and something else we did
to<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.039> help<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.370> our<00:00:56.520> kitchen<00:00:56.940> feel

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
though this is kind of two different
colors<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.750> were<00:01:33.810> able<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.200> match<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.680> paint

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
colors they were able to match the paint

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
colors they were able to match the paint
so<00:01:35.100> always<00:01:35.369> check<00:01:35.549> even<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.869> like

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so always check even if you have like

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
so always check even if you have like
two-toned<00:01:37.560> cabinets<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.820> just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
two-toned cabinets and then I just

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
two-toned cabinets and then I just
painted<00:01:39.479> over<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> spots<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.320> attached<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
painted over the spots I attached the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
painted over the spots I attached the
new<00:01:41.070> knobs<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.540> made<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
new knobs and really it just made the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
new knobs and really it just made the
kitchen<00:01:43.290> look<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.799> much<00:01:44.159> better<00:01:44.549> our<00:01:45.030> drawer

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
kitchen look so much better our drawer

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
kitchen look so much better our drawer
holes<00:01:45.960> are<00:01:46.229> actually<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.220> old<00:01:47.460> size<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
holes are actually the old size like the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
holes are actually the old size like the
1980s<00:01:48.869> size<00:01:49.560> they're<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.310> less<00:01:50.460> than

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
1980s size they're little less than

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.920 
1980s size they're little less than
three<00:01:50.820> inches<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> standard

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
three inches and I think the standard

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.810 
three inches and I think the standard
size<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> three<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
size is three or something like that so

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.600 
size is three or something like that so
I<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.119> took<00:01:54.299> my<00:01:54.479> favorite<00:01:54.930> spray<00:01:55.770> paint<00:01:56.159> oil

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I just took my favorite spray paint oil

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.120 
I just took my favorite spray paint oil
rubbed<00:01:57.180> bronze<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.259> spray-painted<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
rubbed bronze and I spray-painted the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:08.320 
rubbed bronze and I spray-painted the
poles

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.350 

so<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.600> less<00:02:09.840> than<00:02:10.050> $100<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.310> was<00:02:11.430> $85

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so for less than $100 I think it was $85

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.990 
so for less than $100 I think it was $85
