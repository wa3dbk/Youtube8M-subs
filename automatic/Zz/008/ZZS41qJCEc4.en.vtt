00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
guy a shot glass with a built-in chaser

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
guy a shot glass with a built-in chaser
well<00:00:33.129> let<00:00:33.250> me<00:00:33.340> show<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.520> how<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:33.699> works

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.590 

first<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.380> take<00:00:43.559> any<00:00:43.770> chaser<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:46.670> then<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
first you take any chaser and then you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.350 
first you take any chaser and then you
take<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:48.809> choice<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> liquor<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:50.400> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> top

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
take your choice of liquor or at the top

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
take your choice of liquor or at the top
the<00:00:51.960> liquids<00:00:52.290> will<00:00:52.410> stay<00:00:52.559> separated<00:00:53.100> until

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the liquids will stay separated until

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
the liquids will stay separated until
you<00:00:54.149> decide<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.540> drink<00:00:54.720> up<00:00:55.010> snaps<00:00:56.010> up

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.510 

it<00:01:05.400> works<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.860> liquors<00:01:07.860> less<00:01:08.070> dense<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it works because liquors less dense and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.180 
it works because liquors less dense and
most<00:01:08.700> sugar-based<00:01:09.180> chasers<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> two

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
most sugar-based chasers so the two

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.270 
most sugar-based chasers so the two
liquids<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> stay<00:01:12.510> separate<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
liquids want to stay separate it's the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
liquids want to stay separate it's the
design<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.910> the<00:01:14.970> shape<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.480> glass<00:01:15.660> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
design and the shape of the glass that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.470 
design and the shape of the glass that
keeps<00:01:16.410> them<00:01:16.590> separated<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.270> pour

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
keeps them separated so what you pour

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.210 
keeps them separated so what you pour
the<00:01:18.600> bottom<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.080> when<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> pour<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.010> liquor

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the bottom in when you pour the liquor

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
the bottom in when you pour the liquor
on<00:01:20.370> top<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.660> just<00:01:21.810> avoid<00:01:22.170> pouring<00:01:22.500> directly

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
on top you just avoid pouring directly

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
on top you just avoid pouring directly
into<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.370> hole<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> liquor<00:01:24.450> will

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
into the hole and the liquor will

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
into the hole and the liquor will
revolve<00:01:25.290> around<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.460> stay<00:01:26.760> separate

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
revolve around and stay separate

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
revolve around and stay separate
until<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> decide<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.260> drink<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> which<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
until you decide to drink it which is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.380 
until you decide to drink it which is
actually<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> best<00:01:29.760> party<00:01:31.370> to<00:01:32.370> drink<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
actually the best party to drink you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.450 
actually the best party to drink you
simply<00:01:33.840> tilt<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.350> head<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.130> let<00:01:35.340> with

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
simply tilt your head back and let with

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.240 
simply tilt your head back and let with
liquids<00:01:35.820> flow<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> liquids<00:01:37.440> will<00:01:37.530> combine<00:01:37.830> as

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
liquids flow the liquids will combine as

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.560 
liquids flow the liquids will combine as
you're<00:01:38.430> drinking<00:01:38.759> them<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> last<00:01:39.330> thing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you're drinking them and the last thing

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
you're drinking them and the last thing
you<00:01:39.660> taste<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.200> chaser<00:01:42.140> as<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you taste is the chaser as some of you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.280 
you taste is the chaser as some of you
may<00:01:43.800> have<00:01:43.950> seen<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.460> guava<00:01:44.940> before<00:01:45.330> that's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
may have seen the guava before that's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
may have seen the guava before that's
because<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:46.770> designed<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> patented<00:01:47.670> over<00:01:48.509> ten

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
because I designed and patented over ten

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.570 
because I designed and patented over ten
years<00:01:49.020> ago<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.040> Arizona<00:01:50.460> State

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
years ago when I was at Arizona State

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.340 
years ago when I was at Arizona State
University<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.800> that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.430 

so<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.159> beginning<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.900> only<00:02:01.900> company

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
so in the beginning is the only company

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.140 
so in the beginning is the only company
that<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.680> could<00:02:02.860> find<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.280> manufacture<00:02:04.090> the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
that I could find to manufacture the

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.650 
that I could find to manufacture the
last<00:02:04.450> waffle<00:02:05.110> was<00:02:05.409> over<00:02:05.650> in<00:02:05.740> Italy<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.450> for

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
last waffle was over in Italy so for

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.690 
last waffle was over in Italy so for
four<00:02:07.870> years<00:02:07.900> we<00:02:08.649> hadn't<00:02:08.920> produced<00:02:09.130> over<00:02:09.490> there

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
four years we hadn't produced over there

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.940 
four years we hadn't produced over there
and<00:02:10.119> then<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.110> wanted<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.440> bring<00:02:11.620> them<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and then I wanted to bring them to the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.600 
and then I wanted to bring them to the
States

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
States

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.030 
States
and<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.510> teamed<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:13.959> with<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.200> company<00:02:14.560> here

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and so I teamed up with a company here

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.400 
and so I teamed up with a company here
and<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:16.000> had<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> manufactures<00:02:16.990> here<00:02:17.200> ever

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.580 
and have had the manufactures here ever
since

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
since

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.650 
since
so<00:02:20.590> about<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.770> year<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.220> half<00:02:21.430> ago<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.060> went<00:02:22.420> in

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
so about a year and a half ago I went in

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.510 
so about a year and a half ago I went in

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
klopper anymore that it was quote too

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.080 
klopper anymore that it was quote too
hard<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.360> make<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.400> last<00:02:36.610> year<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.000> a

the<00:02:45.670> production<00:02:45.850> here<00:02:46.570> in<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.020> US

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.830 

finally<00:02:50.500> after<00:02:51.250> looking<00:02:51.580> at<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> design<00:02:52.180> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
finally after looking at the design and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.979 
finally after looking at the design and
after<00:02:53.260> much<00:02:53.530> discussion<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:55.510> found<00:02:55.840> a

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
after much discussion we found a

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.120 
after much discussion we found a
solution<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:57.550> middle<00:02:57.910> hole<00:02:58.150> which<00:02:58.870> was<00:02:59.130> 0.85

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
solution the middle hole which was 0.85

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.610 
solution the middle hole which was 0.85
inches<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.760> diameter

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
inches in diameter

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.640 
inches in diameter
we<00:03:02.620> opened<00:03:03.040> up<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> full<00:03:03.850> inch<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.810> that's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
we opened up to a full inch and that's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.770 
we opened up to a full inch and that's
it<00:03:05.890> problem<00:03:06.760> solved

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
it problem solved

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.160 
it problem solved
so<00:03:09.440> with<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.740> little<00:03:09.950> tweak<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.700> design

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
so with that little tweak in the design

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.650 
so with that little tweak in the design
the<00:03:12.170> glass<00:03:12.410> actually<00:03:12.830> pours<00:03:13.550> easier<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
the glass actually pours easier and

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.960 
the glass actually pours easier and
drinks<00:03:15.200> better<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.310> are<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:16.580> ready<00:03:16.610> to
