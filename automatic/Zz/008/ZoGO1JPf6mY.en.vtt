00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:25.149

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.820

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.359
 no more specific name is synonymous now 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.250
 not so important i will do it again 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.260
 I may look up a name 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.719
 find and then I write it too 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.460
 top of the video description so here 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.679
 In the foreground I have quite a nice design of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:08.740
 the packaging stands at the side 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:11.649
 just just a better one right here 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.079
 his description how much heart part 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.149
 tolerates or felt heart has the 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:25.329
 But on the other hand I want everything on the onion 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:26.649
 the video description here you can see 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.509
 The back is also pretty 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.549
 held 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.899
 the in german high quality 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.750
 Drivers offer another bandwidth 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:43.810
 for a balanced and broad 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:46.680
 Dynamic soft and silicone koppen in 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.990
 Three sizes will be perfect fit and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.530
 Noise reduction should be features 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.409
 we have here 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.969
 and how do you not have the game 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.500
 quite as good a packaging for 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.170
 headphones then here a 3.5 millimeters 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.149
 gold-clad gold-embroidered 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.179
 gold plated a connection and here 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:15.210
 easy in three different sizes 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:19.110
 these yes these studs exactly 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:37.080
 These start, I found it right away 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 on as I said when I completely 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:47.600
 beautiful design inside is inside 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.600
 not much anymore 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:05.750
 even then we would now we come 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:08.310
 to the headphones of here stands 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.010
 lightweight i dont know how to do it 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.550
 it pronounces that so be that sun 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.550
 be easy 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:30.780
 all nonsense strictly so I have 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.730
 we still the two different others 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:41.360
 sizes their medium sized relatively large and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:50.210
 Here you have the little ones so so 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:55.590
 Here, as I said, this packaging 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.580
 since the headset can then do so 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.150
 Just put it in 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:06.120
 then they are safe here I come to 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.640
 the conclusion to this the headphone the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.730
 plug in here nice right left 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:21.239
 Captions more beautiful on it 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.930

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.669
 open here 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.140
 if it is nice and soft 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.720
 are also good in the ears I 've got 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:36.370
 already tried 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:42.610
 and here quite normal the connection that 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.090
 was it there from the tutorial now so 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.060
 beautiful 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:51.580
 well, relatively nice and I hope that 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.180
 We'll be in a next tutorial or 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:59.080
 unboxing again or you see me 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.240
 if you liked the video there 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.820
 also good a thumb break if not 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.730
 also gives a thumbs up 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.950
 Of course, a joke canada sometimes give 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.360
 and yes I would be happy if we 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.510

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.440
 turns back on and we'll see each other 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.710

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.710
