the areas that would see distressing or
aging<00:01:30.439> over<00:01:30.649> time<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:31.429> we're<00:01:31.549> just<00:01:31.700> going<00:01:31.909> to

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
aging over time and we're just going to

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.730 
aging over time and we're just going to
kind<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.240> speed<00:01:32.539> up<00:01:32.569> this<00:01:32.840> process<00:01:33.049> using

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
kind of speed up this process using

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.679 
kind of speed up this process using
sandpaper<00:01:34.249> as<00:01:34.639> opposed<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.090> letting<00:01:35.329> light

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
sandpaper as opposed to letting light

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.950 
sandpaper as opposed to letting light
and<00:01:36.469> we're<00:01:36.859> and<00:01:37.460> water<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.479> whatever<00:01:38.659> else

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
and we're and water and whatever else

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.450 
and we're and water and whatever else
would<00:01:39.530> distress<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.950> over<00:01:40.100> time<00:01:40.280> we're<00:01:40.429> just

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
would distress it over time we're just

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.550 
would distress it over time we're just
going<00:01:40.579> to<00:01:40.729> kind<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.939> speed<00:01:41.179> up<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.420> process

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
going to kind of speed up that process

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.639 
going to kind of speed up that process
so<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.590> think<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:43.310> good<00:01:43.969> place<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.569> start<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.319> just

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
so I think a good place to start is just

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.830 
so I think a good place to start is just
places<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.759> would<00:01:46.909> get<00:01:47.149> normal<00:01:47.630> wear<00:01:47.810> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
places that would get normal wear and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.639 
places that would get normal wear and
tear<00:01:48.170> anyways<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:50.149> have<00:01:50.329> detailing<00:01:50.929> so

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
tear anyways and that have detailing so

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.219 
tear anyways and that have detailing so
for<00:01:52.219> all<00:01:52.369> my<00:01:52.579> drawers<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.240> go<00:01:53.389> around<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:54.079> I<00:01:54.170> do

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
for all my drawers I go around and I do

use any paint brush you have I use this
one<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.400> paint<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.090> dust<00:05:02.300> oh<00:05:02.570> it's<00:05:02.750> just<00:05:02.930> a

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
one to paint and to dust oh it's just a

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.020 
one to paint and to dust oh it's just a
synthetic<00:05:03.340> big<00:05:04.340> Brush<00:05:04.550> it's<00:05:04.729> probably<00:05:04.970> about

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
synthetic big Brush it's probably about

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.980 
synthetic big Brush it's probably about
three<00:05:05.390> inches<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.710> just<00:05:06.890> go<00:05:07.070> in<00:05:07.220> here

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
three inches and so I just go in here

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.330 
three inches and so I just go in here
and<00:05:08.990> make<00:05:09.169> sure<00:05:09.440> I'm<00:05:09.590> getting<00:05:09.740> all<00:05:09.979> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
and make sure I'm getting all the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.490 
and make sure I'm getting all the
desktop<00:05:10.789> you<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.000> use<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.240> tack<00:05:11.570> cloth<00:05:11.930> too<00:05:12.229> but

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
desktop you can use a tack cloth too but

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.210 
desktop you can use a tack cloth too but
I<00:05:12.530> find<00:05:12.890> that<00:05:12.979> doing<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.580> brush<00:05:14.300> like<00:05:14.539> this

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
I find that doing a brush like this

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.589 
I find that doing a brush like this
helps<00:05:16.220> get<00:05:16.430> all<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:16.970> stuff<00:05:17.180> that's<00:05:17.300> in<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
helps get all the stuff that's in the

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.360 
helps get all the stuff that's in the
crevices<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.349> I'll<00:05:18.440> do<00:05:18.590> this<00:05:18.740> first<00:05:19.039> and<00:05:19.280> then

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
crevices so I'll do this first and then

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:27.940 
crevices so I'll do this first and then
I'll<00:05:19.580> probably<00:05:19.789> use<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.440> tack<00:05:21.440> brush<00:05:21.800> over<00:05:22.220> that

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.010 

I'm<00:05:28.950> now<00:05:29.250> then<00:05:29.460> with<00:05:29.850> my<00:05:30.090> distressing<00:05:30.780> piece

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020
