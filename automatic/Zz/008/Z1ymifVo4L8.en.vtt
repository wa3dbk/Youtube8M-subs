then<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.099> believe<00:00:11.460> based<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.630> wood<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
then I believe based on the wood that I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.650 
then I believe based on the wood that I
can<00:00:13.139> see<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.530> probably<00:00:13.769> poplar<00:00:14.450> we've<00:00:15.450> got

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660

can see is probably poplar we've got
some<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.520> nail<00:00:17.730> polish

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180

some what I think is some nail polish
here<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.690> something<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.830> looks

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
here or something like that what looks

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.759 
here or something like that what looks
to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.369> ring<00:00:20.730> half<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> ring<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.470> scotch

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to be a ring half a ring from a scotch

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.849 
to be a ring half a ring from a scotch
glass<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.449> feel<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.350> burned<00:00:25.590> right

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
glass and as I feel this it burned right

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
glass and as I feel this it burned right
through<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> finish<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.180> that's<00:00:27.390> telling<00:00:27.630> me

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
through the finish so that's telling me

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.009 
through the finish so that's telling me
that<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> shellac<00:00:30.090> finish<00:00:30.480> got<00:00:30.810> some

this<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.890> what<00:03:11.010> we're<00:03:11.160> left<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.690> dirty<00:03:12.690> rag

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
this is what we're left with dirty rag

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.570 
this is what we're left with dirty rag
with<00:03:13.680> oil<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.220> it

you do not ever want to do this ball it
up<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.450> throw<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.840> somewhere<00:03:19.290> when<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.160> dries

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
up and throw it somewhere when it dries

you'll<00:03:35.790> have<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> fire<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.020> we<00:03:37.440> open<00:03:37.740> these<00:03:37.890> up

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
you'll have a fire so we open these up

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.160 
you'll have a fire so we open these up
just<00:03:38.400> lay<00:03:39.210> them<00:03:39.330> straight<00:03:39.480> out<00:03:39.840> flat<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
just lay them straight out flat on the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.490 
just lay them straight out flat on the
concrete<00:03:46.310> they<00:03:47.310> can't<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.730> any<00:03:47.880> harm<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.380> when

concrete they can't do any harm and when

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.710 
concrete they can't do any harm and when
you<00:03:49.620> find<00:03:49.890> them<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.160> next<00:03:50.400> morning<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.690> next

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
you find them the next morning the next

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.060 
you find them the next morning the next
day<00:03:52.490> generally<00:03:53.490> they<00:03:53.670> are<00:03:54.050> shriveled<00:03:55.050> up<00:03:55.200> as

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
day generally they are shriveled up as

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.880 
day generally they are shriveled up as
the<00:03:56.610> heat<00:03:56.850> pulls<00:03:57.570> them<00:03:57.810> together<00:03:58.140> we're<00:03:58.800> going

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
the heat pulls them together we're going

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.930 
the heat pulls them together we're going
to<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.070> using<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.610> a<00:04:00.830> water-based<00:04:01.940> finish

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940

satin<00:04:03.540> poly<00:04:04.460> acrylic<00:04:05.720> blend<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:07.110> get<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.770> at

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
satin poly acrylic blend I get this at

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.200 
satin poly acrylic blend I get this at
Rockler<00:04:08.460> so<00:04:09.320> it's<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.410> milky<00:04:11.190> kind<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
Rockler so it's a milky kind of

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.099 
Rockler so it's a milky kind of
substance<00:04:12.720> normally<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.590> would<00:04:13.770> not<00:04:13.980> use

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
substance normally I would not use

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.479 
substance normally I would not use
water-based<00:04:16.109> polyurethane<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:17.190> seeing<00:04:17.430> that

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
water-based polyurethane but seeing that

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.360 
water-based polyurethane but seeing that
it's<00:04:17.700> winter<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.870> I'm<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.440> my<00:04:19.470> basement<00:04:19.830> and

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
it's winter and I'm in my basement and

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.950 
it's winter and I'm in my basement and
fumes<00:04:23.370> are<00:04:23.670> always<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.000> problem<00:04:24.390> because<00:04:24.720> I've

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
fumes are always a problem because I've

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.670 
fumes are always a problem because I've
got<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.340> gas<00:04:26.340> hot<00:04:27.000> water<00:04:27.240> tank<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.580> furnace<00:04:29.580> so

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
got a gas hot water tank and furnace so

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.340 
got a gas hot water tank and furnace so
here's<00:04:31.680> how<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.220> basically<00:04:32.550> put<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.350> you

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
here's how you basically put it on you

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.780 
here's how you basically put it on you
use<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> foam<00:04:34.860> brush<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.690> just

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.130 

actually<00:04:41.790> looks<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.150> skim<00:04:42.720> milk<00:04:42.930> when

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
actually looks like skim milk when

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.390 
actually looks like skim milk when
you're<00:04:43.260> putting<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.650> on<00:04:44.120> long<00:04:45.120> strokes<00:04:46.400> and

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
you're putting it on long strokes and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.870 
you're putting it on long strokes and
you<00:04:47.730> just<00:04:47.910> spread<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.390> on<00:04:50.660> after<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:51.840> dries

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
you just spread it on after this dries

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.750 
you just spread it on after this dries
we'll<00:04:53.880> put<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:55.250> little<00:04:56.250> sand<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.730> lightly

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
we'll put on a little sand it lightly

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.570 
we'll put on a little sand it lightly
and<00:04:57.830> then<00:05:00.110> put<00:05:01.110> another<00:05:01.140> cone<00:05:01.620> up<00:05:01.800> I'll<00:05:02.460> let

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
and then put another cone up I'll let

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.300 
and then put another cone up I'll let
that<00:05:02.640> dry<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.330> come<00:05:04.140> back<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.560> lightly<00:05:04.980> sand

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
that dry and come back and lightly sand

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.160 
that dry and come back and lightly sand
it

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.520 

you<00:05:10.170> feel<00:05:10.440> where<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:11.000> grain<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.270> raised<00:05:13.110> -

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
you feel where the grain is raised -

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.070 
you feel where the grain is raised -
fuzzies<00:05:14.280> kind<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.730> come<00:05:14.880> up<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.900> we're<00:05:16.050> just

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
fuzzies kind of come up so we're just

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.770 
fuzzies kind of come up so we're just
lightly<00:05:16.500> sanding<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.880> get<00:05:18.030> that<00:05:18.240> off

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.080 

those<00:05:20.930> little<00:05:21.080> fibers<00:05:21.620> before<00:05:22.070> we<00:05:22.370> apply<00:05:22.850> your

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
those little fibers before we apply your

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:39.869 
those little fibers before we apply your
second<00:05:23.510> coat<00:05:27.340> not<00:05:28.340> much<00:05:28.550> pressure

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.769 

here's<00:05:40.509> a<00:05:40.599> tip<00:05:40.959> in<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.279> pad<00:05:42.520> sander<00:05:43.089> kits<00:05:43.479> if

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
here's a tip in the pad sander kits if

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.889 
here's a tip in the pad sander kits if
you<00:05:43.899> get<00:05:44.110> like<00:05:44.319> the<00:05:44.649> round<00:05:45.520> ones<00:05:45.819> you'll<00:05:46.689> get

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:46.899 
you get like the round ones you'll get

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.019 
you get like the round ones you'll get
spacers<00:05:47.619> these<00:05:48.099> are<00:05:48.219> just<00:05:48.369> made<00:05:48.580> out<00:05:48.729> of<00:05:48.879> paper

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029 
spacers these are just made out of paper

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.019 
spacers these are just made out of paper
I<00:05:49.419> will<00:05:50.169> use<00:05:50.529> these<00:05:50.770> for<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.189> final<00:05:51.580> sanding

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
I will use these for the final sanding

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.999 
I will use these for the final sanding
they<00:05:52.449> work<00:05:52.659> really<00:05:52.869> well<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.439> could<00:05:53.589> also<00:05:53.740> use

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
they work really well you could also use

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.699 
they work really well you could also use
a<00:05:54.039> paper<00:05:54.429> bag<00:05:54.819> that<00:05:55.719> works<00:05:56.050> very<00:05:56.409> well<00:05:56.529> for

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:56.709 
a paper bag that works very well for

00:05:56.709 --> 00:06:00.439 
a paper bag that works very well for
final<00:05:57.339> sanding<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:57.969> it's<00:05:58.719> just<00:05:59.020> rough<00:05:59.800> enough

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
final sanding and it's just rough enough

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.639 
final sanding and it's just rough enough
that<00:06:01.619> what<00:06:02.619> it<00:06:02.740> does<00:06:02.949> is<00:06:03.339> it<00:06:03.699> just<00:06:03.909> puts<00:06:04.149> a<00:06:04.240> baby

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:04.649 
that what it does is it just puts a baby

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:09.179 
that what it does is it just puts a baby
smooth<00:06:05.969> finish<00:06:06.969> on<00:06:07.149> and<00:06:07.589> when<00:06:08.589> you're<00:06:08.800> after

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
smooth finish on and when you're after
