00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
on top of the armor you'll get like 40
to<00:02:39.970> 50<00:02:40.450> k<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.400> pretty<00:02:42.640> good<00:02:43.200> once<00:02:44.200> you're

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
to 50 k so it is pretty good once you're

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.110 
to 50 k so it is pretty good once you're
in<00:02:44.470> there<00:02:44.620> go<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.010> tunnel<00:02:45.280> pretty<00:02:46.000> much

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
in there go in this tunnel pretty much

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.090 
in there go in this tunnel pretty much
run<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.569> end<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.900> tunnel<00:02:47.110> as<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.980> can

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
run to the end of this tunnel as you can

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.740 
run to the end of this tunnel as you can
see<00:02:48.280> they<00:02:48.459> reworked<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.000> whole<00:02:49.239> kalphite

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
see they reworked the whole kalphite

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.229 
see they reworked the whole kalphite
layer<00:02:50.350> which<00:02:50.650> i<00:02:50.830> think<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.700> little<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:52.209> of

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
layer which i think is a little bit of

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.699 
layer which i think is a little bit of
an<00:02:52.360> easter<00:02:52.690> egg<00:02:52.810> for<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.319> kalphite<00:02:53.680> king

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
an easter egg for the kalphite king

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.100 
an easter egg for the kalphite king
which<00:02:54.370> might<00:02:54.850> be<00:02:54.880> coming<00:02:55.000> next<00:02:55.420> month<00:02:55.569> but<00:02:56.080> I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
which might be coming next month but I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.240 
which might be coming next month but I
guess<00:02:56.200> we'll<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.920> wait<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
guess we'll have to wait for the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.840 
guess we'll have to wait for the
behind-the-scenes<00:02:57.850> their<00:02:59.489> way<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.670> as

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
behind-the-scenes their way it's as

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.250 
behind-the-scenes their way it's as
simple<00:03:01.000> as<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.600> run<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> end<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.200> this

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
simple as I just run to the end of this

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.020 
simple as I just run to the end of this

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
show you how to get now but first i'm

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.349 
show you how to get now but first i'm
going<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> show<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.160> what<00:03:39.459> these<00:03:39.609> actually

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
going to show you what these actually

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.810 
going to show you what these actually
look<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:40.540> when<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:40.989> wear<00:03:41.170> them<00:03:41.609> it<00:03:42.609> just

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
look like when you wear them it just

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.610 
look like when you wear them it just
look<00:03:42.940> quite<00:03:43.120> nice<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.690> think<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.109> helm<00:03:44.350> looks

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
look quite nice I think the helm looks

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.780 
look quite nice I think the helm looks
nice<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:46.530> don't<00:03:47.530> think<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.859> scepter<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.430> really

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
nice I don't think the scepter is really

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.479 
nice I don't think the scepter is really
that<00:03:49.299> good<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.410> guess<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:51.220> down<00:03:51.459> a

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
that good but I guess it's down a

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.039 
that good but I guess it's down a
personal<00:03:51.940> preference<00:03:52.150> really<00:03:52.480> if<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.870> like

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
personal preference really if you like

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.479 
personal preference really if you like
it<00:03:53.200> then<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.950> don't<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.280> don't

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
it then you like if you don't you don't

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.690 
it then you like if you don't you don't
all<00:03:55.299> right<00:03:55.450> on<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.870> next<00:03:56.140> one<00:03:56.430> when<00:03:57.430> you're<00:03:57.549> in

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
all right on the next one when you're in

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.690 
all right on the next one when you're in
the<00:03:57.880> dung<00:03:58.500> kalphite<00:03:59.500> layer<00:03:59.859> thing<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.519> want

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
the dung kalphite layer thing you want

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.880 
the dung kalphite layer thing you want
to<00:04:00.819> pretty<00:04:01.540> much<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.720> slice<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.170> all<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.709> these

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
to pretty much a slice of all of these

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.400 
to pretty much a slice of all of these
things<00:04:03.269> what<00:04:04.269> people<00:04:04.540> don't<00:04:04.720> realize<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.260> that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
things what people don't realize is that

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.440 
things what people don't realize is that
you<00:04:05.560> can<00:04:05.739> get<00:04:05.950> comebacks<00:04:06.519> you<00:04:07.030> don't<00:04:07.269> get

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
you can get comebacks you don't get

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.059 
you can get comebacks you don't get
comebacks<00:04:07.780> be<00:04:07.989> when<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:08.260> kill<00:04:08.470> them<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.950> it

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
comebacks be when you kill them so it

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.410 
comebacks be when you kill them so it
could<00:04:09.250> be<00:04:09.280> good<00:04:09.519> for<00:04:09.670> skill<00:04:09.970> o's<00:04:10.090> who've<00:04:10.269> done

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
could be good for skill o's who've done

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.150 
could be good for skill o's who've done
the<00:04:10.540> quest<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.079> possible<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.680> skill<00:04:11.889> is<00:04:11.920> to
