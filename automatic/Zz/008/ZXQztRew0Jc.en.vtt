this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.129> Jake<00:00:02.340> wall<00:00:02.550> 77<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.389> I'm<00:00:03.629> here<00:00:03.870> to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
this is Jake wall 77 and I'm here to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.260 
this is Jake wall 77 and I'm here to
show<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.339> the<00:00:05.339> four<00:00:05.580> cases<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.120> G

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
show you the four cases of the G

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.470 
show you the four cases of the G
permutation<00:00:07.849> what<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.940> want<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.179> know<00:00:09.300> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
permutation what you want to know is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.249 
permutation what you want to know is
that<00:00:10.639> for<00:00:11.639> all<00:00:11.670> four<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.750> even

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
that for all four of them that even

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.099 
that for all four of them that even
asked<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.929> left

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
asked you that I like this on the left

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.420 
asked you that I like this on the left
hand<00:00:16.289> side<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.890> you're<00:00:16.980> solving<00:00:17.160> them

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
hand side of when you're solving them

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.410 
hand side of when you're solving them
and<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:19.289> way<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.470> distinguish<00:00:20.160> each<00:00:20.670> piece<00:00:21.119> or

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and the way to distinguish each piece or

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
and the way to distinguish each piece or
each<00:00:22.160> algorithm<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.380> better<00:00:25.830> match

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
each algorithm is the to better match

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
each algorithm is the to better match
stuff<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.619> these<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
stuff like that and these are in the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
stuff like that and these are in the
back<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.820> right<00:00:30.689> there

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
back to right here right there

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.069 
back to right here right there
so<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.520> yes<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> back<00:00:33.840> too

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
so it's there's yes it's in the back too

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.700 
so it's there's yes it's in the back too
and<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.640> left<00:00:35.820> side<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.710> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and this is on the left side and this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.119 
and this is on the left side and this
algorithm<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.520> r2<00:00:39.680> u<00:00:40.680> prime<00:00:41.120> R<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.010> it<00:00:44.010> was

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
algorithm is r2 u prime R and it was

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.910 
algorithm is r2 u prime R and it was
little<00:00:44.670> used<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> I'll<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> again<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:46.379> two

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
little used and I'll do it again are two

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.250 
little used and I'll do it again are two
little<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.850> prawns<00:00:48.260> are<00:00:49.260> youth<00:00:49.829> clubs<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.760> su

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
little you prawns are youth clubs are su

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
little you prawns are youth clubs are su
far<00:00:52.260> prize<00:00:52.530> lowercase<00:00:53.489> u<00:00:53.670> r2<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.370> do

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
far prize lowercase u r2 and then you do

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
far prize lowercase u r2 and then you do
why<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:58.160> u<00:00:59.160> prime<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.920> far<00:01:03.049> right<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
why are u prime and then far right and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:15.580 
why are u prime and then far right and
that's<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> solve<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.400> other<00:01:08.400> case<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.240 

other<00:01:16.590> cases<00:01:16.890> where<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.909> tool<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.390> here

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
other cases where is tool right here

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.719 
other cases where is tool right here
and<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> -<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.490> further

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and so - all right here so the further

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
and so - all right here so the further
there<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.450> they're<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.409> these

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there but now they're down here in these

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
there but now they're down here in these
two<00:01:25.770> slots<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.490> those<00:01:27.390> who<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
two slots and those who that's it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.080 
two slots and those who that's it
so<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.829> case<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.490> R<00:01:30.299> u<00:01:30.750> R<00:01:31.020> prime<00:01:31.320> Y<00:01:32.040> prime<00:01:32.610> R<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
so this case is R u R prime Y prime R to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.980 
so this case is R u R prime Y prime R to
lowercase<00:01:36.090> u<00:01:36.450> prime<00:01:36.720> our<00:01:37.590> new<00:01:38.250> pawns<00:01:38.990> are

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
lowercase u prime our new pawns are

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
lowercase u prime our new pawns are
prime<00:01:40.290> u<00:01:40.820> R<00:01:41.820> prime<00:01:42.680> lowercase<00:01:43.680> U<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.430> R<00:01:44.670> 2

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
prime u R prime lowercase U and then R 2

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.289 
prime u R prime lowercase U and then R 2
then<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.869> solve<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.909> those<00:01:48.119> are

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
then that's I solve that and those are

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
then that's I solve that and those are
the<00:01:48.540> two<00:01:48.720> cases<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.130> associate<00:01:50.490> each

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
the two cases I like to associate each

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.710 
the two cases I like to associate each
other<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.180> other<00:01:51.659> cases<00:01:52.670> where<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> all

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
other and other cases where it's you all

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.850 
other and other cases where it's you all
right<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.079> again<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:57.439> put<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.530> time<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
right here again and put this time the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.649 
right here again and put this time the
right<00:01:59.009> back<00:01:59.189> here

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:12.600 

and<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.219> algorithm<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:09.899> our<00:02:10.899> prime<00:02:11.610> u

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and to that algorithm is our prime u

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.410 
and to that algorithm is our prime u
prime<00:02:13.319> far<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:15.220> why<00:02:16.680> far<00:02:17.680> too<00:02:18.420> little

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
prime far then you do why far too little

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
prime far then you do why far too little
lowercase<00:02:19.930> u<00:02:20.700> R<00:02:21.700> prime<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.810> are<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.730> plug<00:02:25.000> our

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
lowercase u R prime you are you plug our

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:42.770 
lowercase u R prime you are you plug our
location<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.640> pause<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.180> culture<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.420 

then<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.170> other<00:02:44.349> case<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:46.769> where<00:02:47.769> these<00:02:48.130> two

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
then the other case is where these two

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.400 
then the other case is where these two
are<00:02:51.000> on<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> side<00:02:52.299> again<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.260> then

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
are on the side again like this but then

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.440 
are on the side again like this but then
the<00:02:53.620> two<00:02:53.799> slots<00:02:54.099> are<00:02:54.280> right<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:54.640> but<00:02:55.299> it's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the two slots are right here but it's

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.710 
the two slots are right here but it's
funny

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
funny

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.580 
funny
and<00:02:56.099> yet<00:02:57.099> further<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:59.079> case<00:02:59.290> is<00:03:01.110> r2<00:03:02.110> u<00:03:02.709> R

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and yet further so this case is r2 u R

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.490 
and yet further so this case is r2 u R
prime<00:03:05.590> u<00:03:06.870> r<00:03:07.870> prime<00:03:08.200> u<00:03:08.769> prime<00:03:08.799> are<00:03:09.760> lower<00:03:10.750> case<00:03:11.019> u

cries and R 2 then Y Prime and then just

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:26.430 
cries and R 2 then Y Prime and then just
our<00:03:19.319> cause<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:21.630> are<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:25.019> those<00:03:26.019> are<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> four

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
our cause you are and those are the four

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.050 
our cause you are and those are the four
cases<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.250> G<00:03:27.430> permutation

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
cases of the G permutation
