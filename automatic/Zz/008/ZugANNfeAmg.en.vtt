the fact that it's in 3d is a real

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.190 
the fact that it's in 3d is a real
advantage<00:00:25.060> because<00:00:25.420> it<00:00:25.570> really<00:00:25.840> does<00:00:26.020> bring

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
advantage because it really does bring

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.130 
advantage because it really does bring
you<00:00:26.350> into<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.680> whole<00:00:26.860> event<00:00:27.280> and<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.780> has<00:00:28.930> some

you into the whole event and it has some

you into the whole event and it has some
great<00:00:30.180> adventures<00:00:31.180> that<00:00:31.420> center<00:00:31.720> around<00:00:31.810> 3d

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.819 

we<00:00:34.999> decided<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:35.839> would<00:00:35.989> really<00:00:36.289> redo<00:00:36.710> the

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
we decided that we would really redo the

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.419 
we decided that we would really redo the
whole<00:00:37.010> ride<00:00:37.579> inside<00:00:38.449> and<00:00:38.629> out<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.219> we<00:00:40.219> came<00:00:40.399> up

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
whole ride inside and out and we came up

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.819 
whole ride inside and out and we came up
with<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.699> idea<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.269> instead<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.989> just<00:00:42.140> doing

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
with the idea of instead of just doing

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.740 
with the idea of instead of just doing
one<00:00:43.190> program<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:43.850> changing<00:00:44.239> it<00:00:44.329> every<00:00:44.449> few

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
one program and changing it every few

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.240 
one program and changing it every few
years<00:00:45.019> that<00:00:45.530> we<00:00:45.649> would<00:00:45.799> do<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.010> where<00:00:46.159> it

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
years that we would do it where it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.390 
years that we would do it where it
changes<00:00:46.699> every<00:00:47.120> hour<00:00:47.149> or<00:00:47.659> less

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.420 

I<00:00:53.490> thought<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.540> was<00:00:54.630> fantastic<00:00:54.950> not<00:00:55.950> only<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I thought it was fantastic not only is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.210 
I thought it was fantastic not only is
it<00:00:56.490> a<00:00:57.090> great<00:00:57.900> ride<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> great<00:00:58.890> story

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
it a great ride but it's a great story

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.660 
it a great ride but it's a great story
and<00:00:59.630> it's<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> fantastic<00:01:01.200> combination<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and it's just a fantastic combination of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.180 
and it's just a fantastic combination of
you<00:01:03.150> didn't<00:01:03.420> using<00:01:03.690> technology<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> telling

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
you didn't using technology and telling

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.520 
you didn't using technology and telling
great<00:01:05.340> stories<00:01:05.780> about<00:01:06.780> characters<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.410> know

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
for a long time I don't think anybody

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.670 
for a long time I don't think anybody
does<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.980> better

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.090 

what<00:01:14.370> George<00:01:14.670> did<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.780> films<00:01:16.170> many<00:01:16.770> years

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
what George did in the films many years

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.990 
what George did in the films many years
ago<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.540> immerse<00:01:18.990> people<00:01:19.440> in<00:01:19.800> worlds<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
ago was to immerse people in worlds and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.510 
ago was to immerse people in worlds and
with<00:01:21.450> characters<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.290> ways<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.400> had

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
with characters in ways that they had

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760 
with characters in ways that they had
never<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.210> experienced<00:01:24.780> before<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.320> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
never really experienced before and I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.650 
never really experienced before and I
think<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.190> attraction<00:01:26.790> does<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
think what this attraction does is it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.290 
think what this attraction does is it
takes<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> experience<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:30.180> know

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
takes that experience and and you know

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.810 
takes that experience and and you know
makes<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> even<00:01:31.260> more<00:01:31.560> immersive<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.250> more

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
makes it even more immersive and more

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.580 
makes it even more immersive and more
exciting<00:01:33.300> in<00:01:33.420> many<00:01:33.570> ways<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.260> of<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
exciting in many ways because of the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.760 
exciting in many ways because of the
