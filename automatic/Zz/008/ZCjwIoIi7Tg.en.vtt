hair from my extensions as opposed to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.150

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and I did that because of the level of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189 
and I did that because of the level of
the<00:00:59.430> stylists<00:00:59.850> doing<00:01:00.059> my<00:01:00.210> hair<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.600> felt<00:01:00.989> that
