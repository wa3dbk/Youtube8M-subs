00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.630
 the pedal beauty guys 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.230
 today I'll give a hint here of how to 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.080
 get out of a ditch through the ditches that rain 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.129
 With the storm forming and for you. 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 Getting out of it is a little tricky at times. 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.080
 you are at high speed and there you have 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.290
 slow down a bit 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.290
 try to get out of it, right, and the tip I give is 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.150
 you do not panic concentrating there 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.350
 half of the speech itself waits for a moment of 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:01.010
 which has 111 in it as well to gully 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.059
 you can use it it will fit your 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.950
 wheel and power to leave without tearing and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.500
 Do you want to go out in that place? 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.070
 alone the barranquinho is usually 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.220
 ground gravel only front wheel 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.500
 will give that boy and 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.960
 will hinder your departure so I advise 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.830
 you and coming down into it 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.140
 until you reach a point where you have a 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.390
 pebble a ravine and this one to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.660
 inside for you to use as an aid in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.630
 out of its path there within the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.980
 Ditch nÃ© moves there are you pulling the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.410
 front wheel 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.440
 as far as possible out of the ditch for 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.020
 edit it tear and you turn the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.120
 handlebar and I fell and the rear 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.310
 consequently also of the little pull 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.950
 so she does not slip into the ditch 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.030
 again gives an exit location as well 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.280
 It has to be a place that is good because 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.260
 sometimes there are several ditches you leave 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.380
 me staying in another does not pay better 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.890
 you leave in the safe place makes a 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.679
 reading there in front of the ground and 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.679
 leave a safer place for you, right?
