cruising around and you wish that you
could<00:00:10.050> watch<00:00:10.349> some<00:00:10.800> satellite<00:00:11.490> TV<00:00:11.880> CNN<00:00:12.870> or

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
could watch some satellite TV CNN or

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.250 
could watch some satellite TV CNN or
something<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:14.120> wouldn't<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.210> nice<00:00:15.509> if<00:00:16.020> you

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
something and wouldn't be nice if you

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.540 
something and wouldn't be nice if you
had<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.740> satellite<00:00:17.400> dish<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:19.560> watch<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.310> your

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
had a satellite dish to watch in your

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.240 
had a satellite dish to watch in your
bus<00:00:20.779> like<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.550> well<00:00:23.720> it's<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.869> exactly

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
bus like this well it's not exactly

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.950 
bus like this well it's not exactly
conducive<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.730> driving<00:00:27.180> especially<00:00:27.900> if

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
conducive for driving especially if

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.200 
conducive for driving especially if
you're<00:00:28.760> going<00:00:29.760> cruising<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> high<00:00:31.170> speed<00:00:32.210> so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you're going cruising at a high speed so

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.850 
you're going cruising at a high speed so
I<00:00:33.870> tried<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> exhibitions

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
I tried this for one of the exhibitions

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
I tried this for one of the exhibitions
Volkswagen<00:00:37.860> exhibitions<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.420> year<00:00:39.690> plus

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
Volkswagen exhibitions about a year plus

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139 
Volkswagen exhibitions about a year plus
ago<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.430> worked<00:00:41.579> pretty<00:00:41.850> well

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
ago and it worked pretty well

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.819 
ago and it worked pretty well
I<00:00:42.890> took<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.180> satellite<00:00:46.079> decoder<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
I took the satellite decoder from my

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
I took the satellite decoder from my
house<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:49.250> mounted<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.420> inside<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.600> know

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
house and mounted it inside you know

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.950 
house and mounted it inside you know
just<00:00:52.050> put<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.440> ran<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> projector

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
just put it here and ran the projector

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
just put it here and ran the projector
as<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> pretty<00:00:59.190> good

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
as you can see you can get a pretty good

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.990 
as you can see you can get a pretty good
signal<00:01:01.219> 74<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:03.110> which<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:04.650> good<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
signal 74 here which is very good and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.249 
signal 74 here which is very good and
you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.240> sure<00:01:09.600> watch<00:01:09.930> TV<00:01:11.420> satellite<00:01:12.420> TV
