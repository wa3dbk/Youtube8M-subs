00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 and so hello everyone today I want you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.010
 take away a minute of attention so 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.099
 to tell you why all the same 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.740
 lights on your scooter 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.049
 in principle the main two reasons are due 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 why is this happening the first reason is 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 life on the light bulb the second reason 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.640
 improper humidity let's start with 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.250
 first cause first reason 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.310
 fat is obtained when you buy a new one 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 light bulb many who do not know what is impossible 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.120
 remove the glass surface with your hands 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.570
 so why not do this when 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.510
 take your fingers for the glass 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.170
 surface which is directly 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.969
 heats up when the light comes you 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.850
 leave here fingerprints on 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:58.379
 fingers have a jack which is in process 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.100
 the bulbs work give it more heat 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.930
 than the surface that is skim well 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.140
 and from this comes out here is a swelling and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.500
 the light is on in general this is the first reason 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 the second reason is the wrong importance 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 when you have a scooter on a full-time 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.360
 full-time light bulb 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 with 35 watt 1235 please 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.880
 put the same one back if you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.540
 will put 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 less so you have the best light 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.240
 it works for a long time 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.899
 beautiful light bright beautiful but not for long 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.509
 so if this is a meeting 35 watts means 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.570
 This and put in general are two main 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.220
 reasons for which it happens 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.189
 There is of course also all sorts there 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.890
 closure bad contact and all that else 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.930
 when you put a new light bulb necessarily 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.860
 pink 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.470
 These contacts also seem to be cleaned. 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.830
 and do not touch them to be normal 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.220
 contact but if you accidentally touched 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.910
 to the surface with a glass hand as it were 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.950
 fingers and left imprint there 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.010
 be sure to defat this light bulb and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.140
 something well there I don't know the degreaser 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.310
 there may be some dry there 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.050
 wipe it well with a cloth and then 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.940
 set the scooter in general so well 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.790
 I want to show you last 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.709
 the consequences that come from the fact that 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 the light bulb blows out and works like this 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.390
 that's so bad so if you already have it 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:54.020
 burned out well and here as you can see 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.580
 see here you can see dazzle it works 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.989
 the high beam on and completely melted 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.790
 burned out 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.910
 if you had a dim light or 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.220
 distant no matter necessarily immediately 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.010
 change a light bulb and never 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.200
 continue to go on it because 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.110
 if you do not will be here 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:23.530
 such trouble can be seen up there is no mirror 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.530
 all melted and the bottom as well 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:33.140
 so how to change a light bulb will cost 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:35.600
 inexpensive and change this part 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.530
 plastic this mirror will be much 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.680
 more expensive overall thank you for your attention 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.060
 I will be glad if someone helped 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.210
 subscribe I will share everything than 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.210
 I can in particular on a scooter
