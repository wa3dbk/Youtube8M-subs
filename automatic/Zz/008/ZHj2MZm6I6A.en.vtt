it<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.609> bikes<00:01:59.759> it's<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
it and then if your bikes it's for a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
it and then if your bikes it's for a
while<00:02:00.359> that<00:02:00.659> water<00:02:01.109> will<00:02:01.289> eventually

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
while that water will eventually

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.139 
while that water will eventually
separate<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.789> bottom<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.090> your

tank and start to rest or your
carburetors<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:05.759> away<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.719> not<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> good

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
carburetors right away so not a good

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.290 
carburetors right away so not a good
situation<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.369> we're<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> find<00:02:08.970> which

situation so we're going to find which

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.510 
situation so we're going to find which
chemicals<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.289> purchase<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:11.370> will

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
there are some gas stations that still

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.650 
there are some gas stations that still
offer<00:02:18.410> gasps<00:02:19.410> other<00:02:19.770> than<00:02:20.010> say<00:02:20.220> e<00:02:20.250> 15<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.150> eat<00:02:21.420> n

ethanol and it took two and a half times
as<00:02:55.430> much<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:57.020> go<00:02:57.200> as<00:02:57.380> far<00:02:57.620> as<00:02:57.860> gasoline

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
as much of that to go as far as gasoline

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.950 
as much of that to go as far as gasoline
with<00:02:58.610> gilberg<00:02:58.970> alloted<00:02:59.420> produce<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.780> lot<00:02:59.930> of

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
with gilberg alloted produce a lot of

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.110 
with gilberg alloted produce a lot of
horsepower<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.920> wonder<00:03:01.850> what<00:03:01.940> this

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
horsepower but and wonder what this

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.850 
horsepower but and wonder what this
stuff's<00:03:02.390> going<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.660> do<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.960> valve<00:03:03.230> guides<00:03:03.560> and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
stuff's going to do to valve guides and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.680 
stuff's going to do to valve guides and
things<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.280> there<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.480> little

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
things like that there that's a little

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.900 
things like that there that's a little
scary<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:06.380> an<00:03:06.500> old<00:03:06.650> motorcycle<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.820> I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
scary I have an old motorcycle and I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.690 
scary I have an old motorcycle and I
have<00:03:08.060> new<00:03:08.270> guides<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.080> gasoline<00:03:09.860> but

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
have new guides in it for gasoline but

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.550 
have new guides in it for gasoline but
what<00:03:10.910> about<00:03:10.940> this<00:03:11.330> 'if<00:03:11.600> if<00:03:11.840> dean<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.230> eat<00:03:12.320> n

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
what about this 'if if dean and eat n

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.470 
what about this 'if if dean and eat n
not<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.460> good<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.000> eventually<00:03:14.240> they're

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
not so good so eventually they're

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.450 
not so good so eventually they're
probably<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.930> be<00:03:15.020> selling<00:03:15.620> retrofit

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
probably going to be selling retrofit

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.040 
probably going to be selling retrofit
kits<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.940> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.210> take<00:03:17.360> your<00:03:17.390> motorcycle

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
kits you going to take your motorcycle

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.050 
kits you going to take your motorcycle
and<00:03:18.140> retrofit<00:03:18.680> pieces<00:03:19.070> onto<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.790> order<00:03:20.030> to

and retrofit pieces onto it in order to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.970 
and retrofit pieces onto it in order to
make<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.270> compliant<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.050> say<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> e<00:03:21.350> 15<00:03:21.800> but

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
make it compliant to say the e 15 but

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.160 
make it compliant to say the e 15 but
that's<00:03:22.130> definitely<00:03:22.790> way<00:03:23.480> way<00:03:23.660> down<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.990> road

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170

specific chemicals you can put into your
gasoline<00:03:28.430> before<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.480> fill<00:03:29.690> up<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.440> kind<00:03:30.980> of

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
gasoline before you fill up to kind of

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.130 
gasoline before you fill up to kind of
knock<00:03:31.520> out<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.000> effects<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.630> say<00:03:32.870> this
