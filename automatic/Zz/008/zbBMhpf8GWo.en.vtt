the steps to treat them I have been
having<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.320> trouble<00:02:04.460> moving<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
having a bit of trouble moving the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.270 
having a bit of trouble moving the
patients<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> beds<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.780> some<00:02:06.960> reason<00:02:07.280> I'm

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
patients to the beds for some reason I'm

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.270 
patients to the beds for some reason I'm
not<00:02:08.459> quite<00:02:08.729> sure<00:02:08.759> why

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.080 

X<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.780> I've<00:02:13.959> checked<00:02:14.740> up<00:02:14.980> all<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.610> patients

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
X so I've checked up all the patients

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.380 
X so I've checked up all the patients
not<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.300> go<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.860> computer<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.910> diagnose

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
not to go to the computer to diagnose

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.589 
not to go to the computer to diagnose
them<00:02:19.599> whatever<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.140> then<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:22.180> nurse<00:02:22.390> will

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
them whatever and then the nurse will

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.620 
them whatever and then the nurse will
get<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.860> prescription<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:25.480> give<00:02:25.599> it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
get this prescription and then give it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.340 
get this prescription and then give it
to<00:02:25.750> them<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.520> overall<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.270> pretty<00:02:29.140> basic

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
to them so overall it's pretty basic

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.680 
to them so overall it's pretty basic
time<00:02:29.770> management<00:02:30.160> app<00:02:30.400> when<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.030> gets<00:02:31.239> complex

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
time management app when it gets complex

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.590 
time management app when it gets complex
as<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.280> go<00:02:33.280> through<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.270> bunch<00:02:34.510> of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
as you go through like a bunch of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.000 
as you go through like a bunch of
patients<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.080> five<00:02:35.290> minutes<00:02:35.650> because<00:02:35.830> each

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
patients in five minutes because each

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.620 
patients in five minutes because each
day<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.400> career<00:02:36.700> mode<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:37.030> five<00:02:37.209> minutes<00:02:37.480> long

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
day in career mode is five minutes long

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.970 
day in career mode is five minutes long
and<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.400> all<00:02:39.730> your<00:02:40.980> waiting

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
there's just a whole lot for this game

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.250 
there's just a whole lot for this game
to<00:03:25.110> make<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.380> makes<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.660> pretty<00:03:27.660> easy<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.110> keep

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
to make it makes it pretty easy to keep

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.729 
to make it makes it pretty easy to keep
playing<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.930> obviously<00:03:31.350> you're<00:03:31.709> going

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
playing and then obviously you're going

games lag it's free app so until you buy

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.620 
games lag it's free app so until you buy
them<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.850> doesn't<00:03:45.090> cost<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.390> anything

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
person right here they were in the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.810 
person right here they were in the
cardio<00:03:52.680> rsk's<00:03:53.160> they<00:03:53.250> can<00:03:53.370> get<00:03:53.459> them<00:03:53.640> fast

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
cardio rsk's they can get them fast

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.000 
cardio rsk's they can get them fast
enough<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.420> just<00:03:55.260> save<00:03:55.620> them<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:58.440> game<00:03:58.620> overall

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
enough I just save them the game overall

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.150 
enough I just save them the game overall
just<00:03:59.310> really<00:03:59.550> nice<00:04:00.150> graphics<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.800> lot<00:04:02.010> of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
just really nice graphics it's a lot of

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.120 
just really nice graphics it's a lot of
complexity<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.790> depth<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.800> make<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:04.980> a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
complexity and depth to it and make it a

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.610 
complexity and depth to it and make it a
great<00:04:05.370> game
