00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hello dear readers and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:13.130
 viewers this is a test of a new device 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.630
 element camera companies 6 series camera 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.800
 I check the quality of video recording 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.250
 sound quality and you probably already have something 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 seen heard about this device this 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.689
 the camera in the company do not call action 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.290
 by camera or by someone 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.140
 call it an accessory that is it 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.100
 it is a separate device 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.680
 intended for shooting and video 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.489
 can work under water on a small 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.510
 either with a special cap 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.989
 a long time under water that is possible 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.300
 there to shoot while swimming 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.230
 swimming is wide angle 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.260
 shooting program is true when more 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.570
 wide angle 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 16 megapixel camera fixed 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 focal length led speaker 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.290
 small there is a microphone here 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:23.640
 sound quality can be estimated by this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:28.370
 video and so here she takes 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 I'm looking at the smartphone right now 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.520
 that is, on my smartphone, I have an application 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.020
 installed red and I see that rented but 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.310
 generally implied that you just 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.950
 take this camera with you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.300
 walk with her take pictures shoot and 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.290
 Further, just look at the material on 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.690
 there is an opportunity for a smartphone 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.880
 save all content on the map 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.780
 memory in the camera body itself or 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.440
 discarding on the memory of the smartphone and so 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.899
 there is a function of backups of all photos and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.250
 video records to some cloud 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.500
 storage well at the moment it's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.910
 dropbox and google drive 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.860
 if I am not mistaken is such a thing here and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.330
 still have word mode 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.330
 it is turned on by a separate key 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.480
 you see I'm standing with a smartphone now 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.480
 I see what's going on in the smartphone 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.099
 even so it can be made to look 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.580
 the camera is cool little beautiful 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.760
 similar to periscope toy about it 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.819
 said a hundred times 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.819
 glossy plastic 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.680
 send some kind of toy in my opinion 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.359
 but again Hans attracts attention 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.099
 gloss is a little impractical but in 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:56.120
 the rest of the claims to the appearance 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.670
 design is not comfortable to hold the flu 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.530
 sensor it activates the camera that is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 wakes it from sleep when you 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.209
 pick me up while sleeping 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.590
 mode it can work for 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.260
 month or so about that video is writing 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.359
 somewhere 2 hours but then charge 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.189
 battery and does a lot a lot 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.189
 photos, I donâ€™t say exactly how many 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:26.989
 like everything else in text 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.780
 material well, I think you are already reading 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.609
 actually and about accessories also by the way 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.609
