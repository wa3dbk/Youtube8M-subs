admit I've had very few problems however

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.870 
admit I've had very few problems however
when<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> first<00:00:30.869> installed<00:00:31.410> Windows<00:00:32.340> 10<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
when I first installed Windows 10 it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.549 
when I first installed Windows 10 it
took<00:00:33.120> like<00:00:33.270> three<00:00:33.630> attempts<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> install<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
took like three attempts to install it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.130 
took like three attempts to install it
correctly<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> few<00:00:35.850> little

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
correctly because there are a few little

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.060 
correctly because there are a few little
bugs<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.500> happening<00:00:37.829> basically

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
bugs that was happening basically

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
bugs that was happening basically
weren't<00:00:38.579> letting<00:00:38.760> me<00:00:38.850> log<00:00:39.030> back<00:00:39.270> into<00:00:39.450> my

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

original<00:00:39.780> accounts<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.649> stuff<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.940> took

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
original accounts and stuff so it took

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.160 
original accounts and stuff so it took
me<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.450> longer<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> was

with my PC Whichard

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.249 
with my PC Whichard
meant<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> wasn't<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.570> uploading<00:01:28.140> as

because I knew Windows 10 was on the
horizon<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.430> decided<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> full

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

there's<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.950> delay<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.369> content<00:01:41.850> but

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
there's a bit of delay in content but

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
there's a bit of delay in content but
now<00:01:42.240> I've<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.780> Windows<00:01:43.079> 10<00:01:43.290> everything<00:01:43.649> seems

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
now I've got Windows 10 everything seems

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.020 
now I've got Windows 10 everything seems
to<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.100> working<00:01:44.159> perfectly

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to be working perfectly

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179

just<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.549> play<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> three<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.210> four<00:02:03.240> hours<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just to play like three or four hours of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.959 
just to play like three or four hours of
each<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.619> where<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.969> where

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
each to get back to where I was where

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
each to get back to where I was where
that<00:02:06.060> last<00:02:06.270> play<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.770> gonna

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that last play was up to so that's gonna

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.260 
that last play was up to so that's gonna
take<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.459> time<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.759> hopefully

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
take a little bit of time but hopefully

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.460 
take a little bit of time but hopefully
you<00:02:09.360> know<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.780> might<00:02:09.929> actually<00:02:10.050> make<00:02:10.289> me<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you know it might actually make me a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.010 
you know it might actually make me a
little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.890> better

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
little bit better

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.450 
little bit better
so<00:02:12.380> he's<00:02:12.530> now<00:02:12.680> because<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.950> last<00:02:13.100> couple<00:02:13.220> of

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
so he's now because the last couple of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.830 
so he's now because the last couple of
episodes<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:14.000> been<00:02:14.030> making<00:02:14.450> quite<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.690> few

every<00:03:17.360> couple<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.660> patches<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:18.170> been

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
every couple of patches have been

every couple of patches have been
something<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.620> I've<00:03:18.770> not<00:03:18.890> been<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.070> hundred

percent<00:03:19.460> keen<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.210> hoped<00:03:20.750> it'd<00:03:21.050> be

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
percent keen on and hoped it'd be

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.810 
percent keen on and hoped it'd be
changed<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.740> didn't<00:03:21.980> want<00:03:22.010> actually<00:03:22.340> focus

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.600 
got and I can sometimes be a little
overly<00:03:44.270> harsh<00:03:44.710> if<00:03:45.710> anybody<00:03:46.220> will<00:03:46.310> subscribe

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
overly harsh if anybody will subscribe

back<00:03:46.760> when<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.180> did<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.390> little<00:03:47.510> bit<00:03:47.660> about<00:03:47.840> a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
back when I did a little bit about a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.240 
back when I did a little bit about a
filled<00:03:48.170> content<00:03:48.590> you'll<00:03:48.710> understand

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
filled content you'll understand

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.500 
filled content you'll understand
completely<00:03:49.730> what<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.030> mean

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
completely what I mean

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.840 
completely what I mean
so<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.960> didn't<00:03:51.560> want<00:03:51.710> to<00:03:51.770> like<00:03:51.950> start<00:03:52.340> hating<00:03:52.760> on

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
so I didn't want to like start hating on

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.630 
so I didn't want to like start hating on
the<00:03:52.940> game<00:03:53.120> publicly<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.490> because<00:03:55.490> I<00:03:55.520> was

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
the game publicly and because I was

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.730 
the game publicly and because I was
frustrated<00:03:56.270> with<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.480> patch<00:03:56.840> or<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.230> feature

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
frustrated with a patch or a feature

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.120 
frustrated with a patch or a feature
which<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:58.310> knew<00:03:58.930> was<00:03:59.930> likely<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.470> change<00:04:00.650> or<00:04:00.920> at

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
which I knew was likely to change or at

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.520 
which I knew was likely to change or at
least<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:02.090> decent<00:04:02.450> possibility<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.350> being

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
least have a decent possibility of being

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.160 
least have a decent possibility of being
changed<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.550> far<00:04:04.820> things<00:04:05.090> are<00:04:05.360> going<00:04:05.390> fairly

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
maybe that patch will be the patch which

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.330 
maybe that patch will be the patch which
will<00:04:22.820> start<00:04:23.540> settling<00:04:24.350> things<00:04:24.530> down<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.890> little

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
will start settling things down a little

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.800 
will start settling things down a little
we<00:04:25.490> kind<00:04:25.699> of<00:04:25.760> know<00:04:25.910> where<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.180> games<00:04:26.389> at<00:04:26.600> right

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
we kind of know where the games at right

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.420 
we kind of know where the games at right
now<00:04:27.020> we're<00:04:27.560> kind<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.860> getting<00:04:27.980> a<00:04:28.160> feel<00:04:28.190> for

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
now we're kind of getting a feel for

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.700 
now we're kind of getting a feel for
were<00:04:28.850> Splash<00:04:29.150> Damage<00:04:29.180> he's<00:04:29.540> taking<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.139> what

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
were Splash Damage he's taking it what

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.740 
were Splash Damage he's taking it what
else<00:04:30.830> one<00:04:31.160> goes<00:04:31.340> aren't<00:04:31.760> entirely<00:04:32.180> happy<00:04:32.510> with

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
else one goes aren't entirely happy with

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.120 
else one goes aren't entirely happy with
that<00:04:32.870> we<00:04:33.080> are<00:04:33.199> actually<00:04:33.410> getting<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.889> place

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
that we are actually getting to a place

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.590 
that we are actually getting to a place
which<00:04:34.340> is<00:04:34.370> starting<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.820> make<00:04:34.940> sense<00:04:35.210> so

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
which is starting to make sense so

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.840 
which is starting to make sense so
hopefully<00:04:36.500> after<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.979> next<00:04:37.160> patch<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.610> will<00:04:37.760> be

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
hopefully after the next patch I will be

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.090 
hopefully after the next patch I will be
able<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.030> start<00:04:38.210> producing<00:04:38.510> some<00:04:39.100> fairly

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
able to start producing some fairly

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.040 
able to start producing some fairly
decent<00:04:40.220> content<00:04:40.940> for<00:04:41.270> tips<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.660> tricks<00:04:41.870> and

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
decent content for tips and tricks and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.650 
decent content for tips and tricks and
all<00:04:42.169> that<00:04:42.290> kind<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.560> stuff<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.449> but<00:04:44.449> yeah

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
all that kind of stuff and but yeah

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.260 
all that kind of stuff and but yeah
apart<00:04:45.350> from<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:46.160> think<00:04:46.850> everything's

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
apart from that I think everything's

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.540 
apart from that I think everything's
kind<00:04:47.540> of<00:04:47.600> going<00:04:47.660> back<00:04:48.380> on<00:04:48.650> track<00:04:48.979> I<00:04:49.250> mean<00:04:49.460> I

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
kind of going back on track I mean I

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.770 
kind of going back on track I mean I
know<00:04:49.610> that<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.970> contents<00:04:50.389> not<00:04:50.510> been<00:04:50.660> as

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
know that the contents not been as

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.360 
know that the contents not been as
regular<00:04:51.199> is<00:04:51.350> what<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.620> should<00:04:51.800> have<00:04:51.830> been<00:04:51.949> and

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
regular is what it should have been and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.469 
regular is what it should have been and
I<00:04:52.520> do<00:04:52.580> apologize<00:04:53.120> for<00:04:53.150> that

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
I do apologize for that

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.900 
I do apologize for that
but<00:04:54.020> overall<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:54.979> have<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.280> say<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.610> I'm<00:04:55.669> very

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
but overall I have to say that I'm very

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.909 
but overall I have to say that I'm very
happy<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.419> Windows<00:04:56.810> 10<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.620> know<00:04:57.710> it's<00:04:57.860> a
