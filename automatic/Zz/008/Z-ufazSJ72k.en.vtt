benefit of the Mesa reader now as you
can<00:03:34.840> see<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.200> have<00:03:35.380> some<00:03:35.530> tin<00:03:35.769> or<00:03:36.510> piece<00:03:37.510> of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
can see here I have some tin or piece of

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.810 
can see here I have some tin or piece of
copper<00:03:37.900> cable<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.070> charcoal<00:03:39.459> you'll<00:03:39.670> need

that piece of copper cable to actually
hook<00:03:41.560> your<00:03:41.739> generator<00:03:42.190> up<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.609> macerator

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
hook your generator up to the macerator

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.509 
hook your generator up to the macerator
real<00:03:44.410> briefly<00:03:44.769> I'll<00:03:44.920> show<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.220> what<00:03:45.430> the

real briefly I'll show you what the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.910 
real briefly I'll show you what the
benefit<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.030> as<00:03:46.329> most<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.840> know<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.739> put

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
benefit is as most of you know you put

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.599 
benefit is as most of you know you put
an<00:03:48.040> ore<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:49.329> normally<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:49.870> one<00:03:49.930> or

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
an ore in and normally you get one or

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.800 
an ore in and normally you get one or
you<00:03:51.609> know<00:03:51.700> per<00:03:51.910> item<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.480> put<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:52.750> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
you know per item that you put in the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.470 
you know per item that you put in the
furnace<00:03:53.519> well<00:03:54.519> if<00:03:54.609> you<00:03:54.700> hook<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.000> generator

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
furnace well if you hook the generator

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.580 
furnace well if you hook the generator
up<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.900> macerator

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
up to the macerator

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.250 
up to the macerator
and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.090> put<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> piece<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:58.810> coal<00:03:58.930> on<00:03:59.079> here

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
and then you put a piece of coal on here

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.490 
and then you put a piece of coal on here
to<00:03:59.380> fuel<00:03:59.620> it

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
to fuel it

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.470 
to fuel it
and<00:04:01.280> what<00:04:01.460> you<00:04:01.580> want<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.820> do<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.000> put<00:04:02.150> your<00:04:02.270> tin

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and what you want to do is put your tin

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:13.340 
and what you want to do is put your tin
over<00:04:02.630> here<00:04:02.930> in<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.080> Mesa

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.250 

as<00:04:13.800> you<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.040> see

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
as you can see

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.760 
as you can see
this<00:04:16.800> rate<00:04:17.100> R<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.900> over<00:04:19.170> here<00:04:19.320> if<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.440> put<00:04:19.650> it

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
this rate R is over here if you put it

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.500 
this rate R is over here if you put it
in<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:19.980> macerator<00:04:20.310> it'll<00:04:20.790> crush<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.210> up<00:04:21.300> and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
in the macerator it'll crush it up and

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.470 
in the macerator it'll crush it up and
grind<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.900> into<00:04:22.050> ten<00:04:22.890> dust<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:24.300> will

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
grind it into ten dust and that will

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.170 
grind it into ten dust and that will
then<00:04:24.510> convert<00:04:24.990> into<00:04:25.140> toots<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.710> dust<00:04:26.180> then

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
then convert into toots and dust then

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.400 
then convert into toots and dust then
we'll<00:04:27.300> come<00:04:27.420> over<00:04:27.630> here<00:04:27.780> stick<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.230> in<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
we'll come over here stick that in the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.160 
we'll come over here stick that in the
furnace<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.510> better<00:04:30.510> put<00:04:30.690> another<00:04:30.900> piece<00:04:31.110> of

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
furnace I better put another piece of

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.270 
furnace I better put another piece of
charcoal<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.650> don't<00:04:31.830> think<00:04:31.980> I'm<00:04:32.070> gonna<00:04:32.160> have

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
charcoal I don't think I'm gonna have

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.110 
charcoal I don't think I'm gonna have
enough<00:04:34.370> sorry<00:04:35.370> if<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.670> hear<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.910> train

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
enough sorry if you can hear the train

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.860 
enough sorry if you can hear the train
in<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.360> background<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:39.090> anyways<00:04:39.450> as<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.750> can

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
in the background but anyways as you can

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.100 
in the background but anyways as you can
see<00:04:40.340> for<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.520> 210<00:04:41.940> dust<00:04:42.180> we<00:04:42.360> will<00:04:42.390> then<00:04:42.660> get<00:04:42.840> to

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
see for the 210 dust we will then get to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.400 
see for the 210 dust we will then get to
ten<00:04:43.410> ores<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:45.420> macerator<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.960> probably<00:04:46.290> one

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
ten ores the macerator is probably one

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.460 
ten ores the macerator is probably one
of<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.560> greatest<00:04:46.770> machines<00:04:47.280> in<00:04:47.970> Tekkit<00:04:48.540> it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
of the greatest machines in Tekkit it

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.400 
of the greatest machines in Tekkit it
doubles<00:04:49.860> your<00:04:49.890> orders<00:04:50.810> obviously<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
doubles your orders obviously so you

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.370 
doubles your orders obviously so you
know<00:04:52.530> in<00:04:52.770> my<00:04:52.830> opinion<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.670> is<00:04:53.700> mandatory<00:04:54.380> but

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
know in my opinion it is mandatory but

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.990 
know in my opinion it is mandatory but
that<00:04:55.500> basically<00:04:55.830> covers<00:04:56.130> today's<00:04:56.550> basic

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
that basically covers today's basic

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.850 
that basically covers today's basic
machines<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.110> next<00:04:58.350> episode<00:04:58.710> I'll

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
machines in the next episode I'll

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.820 
machines in the next episode I'll
probably<00:04:59.070> go<00:04:59.400> over<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.900> extractor<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:01.680> that

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
probably go over the extractor so that

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.740 
probably go over the extractor so that
you<00:05:01.920> get<00:05:02.070> more<00:05:02.220> rubber<00:05:02.550> instead<00:05:03.420> of<00:05:03.510> getting

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
you get more rubber instead of getting

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.020 
you get more rubber instead of getting
one<00:05:03.780> for<00:05:04.080> one<00:05:04.290> you<00:05:04.530> will<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:05.250> get<00:05:05.490> three<00:05:05.820> for

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
one for one you will then get three for

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.750 
one for one you will then get three for
one<00:05:06.500> but<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.650> wraps<00:05:07.860> up<00:05:08.070> today's<00:05:08.160> episode<00:05:08.730> I

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
one but that wraps up today's episode I

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.190 
one but that wraps up today's episode I
hope<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.000> guys<00:05:09.180> enjoyed<00:05:09.540> be<00:05:09.930> sure<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.080> leave
