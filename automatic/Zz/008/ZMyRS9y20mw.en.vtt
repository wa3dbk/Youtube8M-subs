00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
my folks Tim Behrens here I recently saw

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.320 
my folks Tim Behrens here I recently saw
a<00:01:02.480> demo<00:01:02.930> for<00:01:03.170> MIDI<00:01:03.380> guitar<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:04.180> I've<00:01:05.180> been

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
a demo for MIDI guitar and I've been

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.910 
a demo for MIDI guitar and I've been
playing<00:01:05.570> around<00:01:05.660> with<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.080> app<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.380> lot<00:01:06.560> great

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
playing around with that app a lot great

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.850 
playing around with that app a lot great
app<00:01:07.210> very<00:01:08.210> responsive<00:01:08.960> tracks<00:01:09.320> really<00:01:09.560> well

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
app very responsive tracks really well

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.950 
app very responsive tracks really well
has<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.430> polyphonic<00:01:11.119> option<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.810> can

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
has the polyphonic option so it can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.550 
has the polyphonic option so it can
recognize<00:01:12.250> multiple<00:01:13.250> notes<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.240> time<00:01:14.560> but

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
recognize multiple notes at a time but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.500 
recognize multiple notes at a time but
this<00:01:15.650> demo<00:01:15.860> really<00:01:16.100> isn't<00:01:16.400> about<00:01:16.550> that<00:01:16.610> app<00:01:16.970> as

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
this demo really isn't about that app as

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.180 
this demo really isn't about that app as
a<00:01:17.630> dabbler<00:01:18.020> I'm<00:01:18.380> not<00:01:18.560> quite<00:01:18.800> ready<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.070> make

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
a dabbler I'm not quite ready to make

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.480 
a dabbler I'm not quite ready to make
that<00:01:19.520> $20<00:01:20.090> an<00:01:20.810> app<00:01:21.020> purchase<00:01:21.470> for<00:01:21.710> MIDI<00:01:21.920> out<00:01:22.190> so

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
that $20 an app purchase for MIDI out so

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.190 
that $20 an app purchase for MIDI out so
I<00:01:22.520> wanted<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.000> show<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.300> my<00:01:23.800> workaround

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
I wanted to show you my workaround

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
everybody knows what a cool app thumbjam

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.609 
everybody knows what a cool app thumbjam
is<00:01:28.880> one<00:01:29.600> thing<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.899> did<00:01:30.080> not<00:01:30.259> know<00:01:30.470> until

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
is one thing I did not know until

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.460 
is one thing I did not know until
recently<00:01:31.220> was<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.759> has<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.060> built-in<00:01:32.899> audio

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
recently was it it has a built-in audio

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.880 
recently was it it has a built-in audio
to<00:01:33.710> MIDI<00:01:33.830> conversion<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.440> that's<00:01:36.440> actually

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
to MIDI conversion and that's actually

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.340 
to MIDI conversion and that's actually
what<00:01:37.009> I'm<00:01:37.130> using<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.729> play<00:01:38.390> these<00:01:38.750> samples<00:01:39.200> and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
what I'm using to play these samples and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.370 
what I'm using to play these samples and
sample<00:01:39.830> tank<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.310> those<00:01:40.430> opening<00:01:40.850> clips<00:01:41.380> so

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
sample tank and those opening clips so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.810 
sample tank and those opening clips so
just<00:01:42.560> wanted<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.890> show<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.130> this<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.670> little

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
just wanted to show you this this little

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.430 
just wanted to show you this this little
icon<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.420> next<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.869> loop<00:01:45.050> button

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
icon up next to the loop button

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.100 
icon up next to the loop button
it's<00:01:45.649> a<00:01:45.710> mic<00:01:45.920> with<00:01:46.130> some<00:01:46.340> notes<00:01:46.550> next<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.840> is

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
it's a mic with some notes next to it is

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.400 
it's a mic with some notes next to it is
your<00:01:48.590> audio<00:01:49.580> input<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:50.930> case<00:01:51.200> it's

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
your audio input and in this case it's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.200 
your audio input and in this case it's
my<00:01:51.560> guitar<00:01:51.710> running<00:01:52.280> through<00:01:52.460> an<00:01:52.550> Alesis<00:01:52.970> IO

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
my guitar running through an Alesis IO

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.010 
my guitar running through an Alesis IO
dock<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:54.820> there's<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.910> couple<00:01:56.149> of<00:01:56.330> icons<00:01:56.479> here

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
dock and there's a couple of icons here

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.809 
dock and there's a couple of icons here
the<00:01:57.170> first<00:01:57.410> is<00:01:57.830> you'll<00:01:58.190> see<00:01:58.369> kind<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.700> a

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
the first is you'll see kind of a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.199 
the first is you'll see kind of a
staggered<00:01:59.750> staircase<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.940> when<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.030> have

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
staggered staircase and when you have

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.850 
staggered staircase and when you have
that<00:02:02.300> option<00:02:02.720> on<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.869> will<00:02:03.110> only<00:02:03.319> play<00:02:03.619> the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
that option on it will only play the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.919 
that option on it will only play the
audio<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.429> fits<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.850> with<00:02:04.880> within<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.539> scale

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
audio that fits in with within the scale

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.949 
audio that fits in with within the scale
that<00:02:06.289> thumbjam<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:07.039> showing<00:02:07.599> not<00:02:08.599> real<00:02:08.840> great

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
that thumbjam is showing not real great

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.960 
that thumbjam is showing not real great
for<00:02:09.349> what<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:09.950> want<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.640> click<00:02:10.849> it

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
for what we want to do so we click it

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.730 
for what we want to do so we click it
again<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.330> will<00:02:11.420> become<00:02:11.569> an<00:02:11.870> even<00:02:11.959> staircase

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
again it will become an even staircase

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.610 
again it will become an even staircase
in<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.640> case<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.090> tracks<00:02:14.450> chromatically<00:02:15.319> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
in this case it tracks chromatically and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.190 
in this case it tracks chromatically and
tracks<00:02:16.040> really<00:02:16.250> well

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.630 

so<00:02:20.200> I'm<00:02:20.290> playing<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> cello<00:02:20.890> sounds<00:02:21.430> right

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so I'm playing the cello sounds right

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.620 
so I'm playing the cello sounds right
there

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
there

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.559 
there
you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.680> switch<00:02:24.580> octaves<00:02:25.060> pretty<00:02:25.330> quickly

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
you can switch octaves pretty quickly

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.920 
you can switch octaves pretty quickly
same<00:02:25.989> notes<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.510> adjust<00:02:31.630> a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
same notes and you can adjust a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.420 
same notes and you can adjust a
threshold<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.920> amount<00:02:33.099> of<00:02:33.280> sound

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
threshold which is the amount of sound

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.670 
threshold which is the amount of sound
that's<00:02:33.730> coming<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.110> static

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that's coming in so if you have static

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.830 
that's coming in so if you have static
or<00:02:35.920> string<00:02:36.610> buzz<00:02:36.850> or<00:02:37.090> anything<00:02:37.270> like<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.540> you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
or string buzz or anything like that you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.900 
or string buzz or anything like that you
can<00:02:37.870> kind<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.319> use<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> gate<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.760> that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
can kind of use it like a gate so that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.940 
can kind of use it like a gate so that
it<00:02:40.030> only<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.330> picking<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.900> notes<00:02:41.200> works

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
it only is picking up the notes works

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.759 
it only is picking up the notes works
really<00:02:42.130> well<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.580> sweet<00:02:42.760> spot<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.300> about<00:02:43.420> 56

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
really well my sweet spot is about 56

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.250 
really well my sweet spot is about 56
there's<00:02:45.370> also<00:02:45.550> velocity<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.930> control

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
there's also velocity so you can control

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.630 
there's also velocity so you can control
the<00:02:47.380> amount<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.680> velocity<00:02:47.890> that's<00:02:48.340> getting

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the amount of velocity that's getting

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.729 
the amount of velocity that's getting
sent<00:02:48.940> out<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.300> glide<00:02:50.019> which<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.530> haven't

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
sent out and glide which I haven't

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.290 
sent out and glide which I haven't
played<00:02:50.890> around<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.340> lot<00:02:51.519> with<00:02:51.700> but<00:02:51.940> which<00:02:52.120> is

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
played around a lot with but which is

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.100 
played around a lot with but which is
how<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.080> moves<00:02:53.319> between<00:02:53.530> notes<00:02:54.750> what<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.780> did

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
how it moves between notes what I did

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.809 
how it moves between notes what I did
for<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.739> right<00:02:57.220> now<00:02:57.250> I'm<00:02:57.430> just<00:02:57.549> playing

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
for this right now I'm just playing

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.479 
for this right now I'm just playing
thumbjam<00:02:58.200> samples<00:02:59.200> but<00:02:59.680> what<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.830> did<00:03:00.130> for

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
thumbjam samples but what I did for

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.070 
thumbjam samples but what I did for
SampleTank<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.480> went<00:03:01.630> into<00:03:01.810> edit<00:03:02.590> sample

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
SampleTank is I went into edit sample

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.809 
SampleTank is I went into edit sample
control<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.590> turned<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.160> volume<00:03:06.310> for

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
control and I turned the volume for

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.720 
control and I turned the volume for
thumbjam<00:03:07.080> sample<00:03:08.080> all<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.260> way<00:03:08.470> down<00:03:08.730> under

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
thumbjam sample all the way down under

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.970 
thumbjam sample all the way down under
sample<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.450> also<00:03:10.600> turned<00:03:10.959> off<00:03:11.110> polyphonic

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
sample I also turned off polyphonic

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.920 
sample I also turned off polyphonic
seems<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.400> track<00:03:12.670> better<00:03:12.910> when<00:03:13.150> polyphonic<00:03:13.780> is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
seems to track better when polyphonic is

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.820 
seems to track better when polyphonic is
off<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.780> was<00:03:16.900> done<00:03:17.049> with<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.590> went

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
off and so I was done with that I went

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.750 
off and so I was done with that I went
into<00:03:17.950> preferences<00:03:18.690> MIDI<00:03:19.690> control<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.549> back

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
into preferences MIDI control we go back

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.780 
into preferences MIDI control we go back
there<00:03:21.970> MIDI<00:03:22.209> control<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.549> turned<00:03:24.549> on<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
there MIDI control and turned on the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.229 
there MIDI control and turned on the
MIDI<00:03:25.150> output<00:03:25.690> connections<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.620> SampleTank

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
MIDI output connections for SampleTank

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.750 
MIDI output connections for SampleTank
now<00:03:28.239> if<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.480> switch<00:03:28.630> over<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.260> app<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.980> can

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
now if I switch over to that app I can

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.800 
now if I switch over to that app I can
just<00:03:30.940> show<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.120> real<00:03:31.359> quick<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:31.780> know

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
have the instruments that I played in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.009

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
foreground for that to work you can hear

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.640 
foreground for that to work you can hear
it's<00:03:52.359> kind<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.630> tracking<00:03:52.870> already<00:03:53.320> for<00:03:53.530> me

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
it's kind of tracking already for me

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.380 
it's kind of tracking already for me
just<00:03:53.829> running<00:03:54.250> my<00:03:54.370> hand<00:03:54.579> across<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.060> strings

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
just running my hand across the strings

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:06.200 
just running my hand across the strings
and<00:03:56.850> there<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.970> really<00:03:58.269> have<00:03:58.420> it

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.850 

works<00:04:07.210> pretty<00:04:07.420> well<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:08.050> last<00:04:08.650> time<00:04:08.830> I

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
works pretty well and last time I

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.880 
works pretty well and last time I
checked<00:04:09.220> thumb<00:04:09.430> dam<00:04:09.610> was<00:04:09.760> about<00:04:10.000> $5<00:04:10.890> great

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
checked thumb dam was about $5 great

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.710 
checked thumb dam was about $5 great
purchase<00:04:12.160> even<00:04:12.640> without<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.090> audio<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.600> MIDI

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
purchase even without the audio to MIDI

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.350 
purchase even without the audio to MIDI
conversion<00:04:14.470> but<00:04:15.220> with<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.580> yeah<00:04:15.760> it's<00:04:15.910> it's<00:04:16.209> a

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
conversion but with it yeah it's it's a

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.210 
conversion but with it yeah it's it's a
fun<00:04:16.600> toy<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.200> some<00:04:17.440> cases<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.950> tracks

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
fun toy and in some cases it tracks

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.650 
fun toy and in some cases it tracks
better<00:04:18.400> than<00:04:18.700> some<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.120> other<00:04:19.269> apps<00:04:19.510> that

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
better than some of the other apps that

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.110 
better than some of the other apps that
are<00:04:19.900> out<00:04:20.440> there<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:21.040> are<00:04:21.190> dedicated<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.970> this

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
are out there that are dedicated to this

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.090 
are out there that are dedicated to this
certainly<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.140> can't<00:04:23.440> say<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.770> for<00:04:23.800> MIDI

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
certainly I can't say that for MIDI

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.770 
certainly I can't say that for MIDI
guitar<00:04:24.280> would<00:04:24.760> love<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.150> demo<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.600> if

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
guitar would love to demo that if

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.320 
guitar would love to demo that if
someone<00:04:26.140> wanted<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.530> send<00:04:26.800> me<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.980> code<00:04:27.330> but

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
someone wanted to send me a code but

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.210 
someone wanted to send me a code but
yeah<00:04:28.750> there's<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.110> dabbler<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.560> just<00:04:29.830> can't<00:04:30.040> make

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
yeah there's a dabbler I just can't make

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.670 
yeah there's a dabbler I just can't make
that<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:31.060> leap<00:04:31.450> yet<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.170> wanted<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.530> show

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.870 
that that leap yet so I wanted to show
you<00:04:32.740> my<00:04:32.800> work<00:04:33.010> around<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.550> hope<00:04:33.670> you<00:04:33.790> have
