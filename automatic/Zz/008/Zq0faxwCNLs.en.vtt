00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.490
 i leave with the camper but when 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.080
 I haven't left yet 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.039
 and I'm having fun with the thought 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.800
 imagining the possible ways of 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.800
 travel by land water and sky 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.670
 but before that to not lose in 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.440
 departure and the war against rust 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.960
 I eliminate the infiltration of water that 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.670
 have deteriorated the camper i 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.430
 work done previously on 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.620
 gutter were the classic heel a 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.290
 worse than the hole 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.059
 in these cases courageous choices are needed 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.210
 the best anti-rust and surgery 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.210
 invasive 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.090
 cap a hole with another hole more 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.520
 large is useful in making i 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.649
 camper to the pelosetti even when it is 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.869
 locked in case they get tired of 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.619
 expect me to be bad weather while me 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.619
 I enjoy it in the waves 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.910
 go and let yourself be tried 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.670
 I pretend to live in a world of my own 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.299
 one of the increasingly strong storms of the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.690
 century 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.400
 distracted me from work on the camper but 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.400
 just for the time to enjoy some 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.900
 before doing other jobs to clean up 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.230
 my favorite place to work 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.230
 on the field
