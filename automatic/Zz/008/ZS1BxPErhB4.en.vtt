00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
Himalayan climbing is going to be like I

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:45.170 
Himalayan climbing is going to be like I
believe<00:03:40.980> alpinism<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:42.209> gonna<00:03:43.700> go<00:03:44.700> different

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
believe alpinism is gonna go different

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
believe alpinism is gonna go different
ways<00:03:45.359> like<00:03:45.719> I<00:03:46.260> don't<00:03:46.799> think<00:03:47.129> there<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.310> one

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
ways like I don't think there is one

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.000 
ways like I don't think there is one
single<00:03:48.060> style<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.629> we<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.109> do<00:03:49.260> or<00:03:49.500> that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
single style that we have to do or that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.250 
single style that we have to do or that
ISKCON<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:51.000> has<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.629> considered<00:03:51.870> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
ISKCON that has to be considered the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.259 
ISKCON that has to be considered the
best<00:03:52.469> so<00:03:52.739> but<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.099> think<00:03:53.310> there<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.549> many<00:03:53.790> styles

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
best so but I think there is many styles

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.559 
best so but I think there is many styles
that<00:03:54.359> are<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:55.139> good<00:03:55.439> and<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:56.569> definitely

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
that are very good and it definitely

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.369 
that are very good and it definitely
depends<00:03:57.989> on<00:03:58.489> what<00:03:59.489> you<00:03:59.609> want<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.909> do<00:04:00.169> you<00:04:01.169> talk

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
depends on what you want to do you talk
