00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Let's walk what it is that I am. 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.170
 male of a given break in the strike 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 shark where the team will attack the face 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.410
 from this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.410
 the firewall does not even exist there 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.320
 son of a bitch 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.170
 suzanne 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.559
 And then it's good, I'm here to show. 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.920
 for you several streg the whole of gta 5 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.500
 good 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.629
 I do not know if for a sector because I never 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.790
 You can know all the hotels in a game. 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.020
 can leave the new ones that I will not say 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.570
 everyone with the first one to come already knows 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.040
 so you already know pita mint 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.270
 It's bigger to talk about why the route was 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.480
 something in the bees is what this commitment is 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.960
 then many heroes of the game coconut this is well 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.399
 cool 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 in my opinion I'll show you 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.920
 You some just start the mission again. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.440
 it 's good here 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.399
 this is the first game of the mission right 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.530
 Mandatory version where if you had 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.710
 followed its route 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.560
 It's a bridge you pass under the bridge. 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:29.890
 bridge galley passing under the bridge 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:33.600
 to be a frozen new thump I think 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 Have you seen this in several places? 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:44.830
 the flops galley let's go there is a place 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 here the 18 and frozen galley look that the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.910
 pt type 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.250
 or turned the first one delivered is for 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:08.649
 who does not know is like mysteries 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:13.270
 of the game and let's go to five what's good is 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.670
 One for you, you see, here 's more I'll go. 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.050
 I'll put a little map there to show you 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:24.640
 you already that it is good it will pay more or 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.430
 least in this region here are these islands 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.710
 you mark a country territory - from that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.650
 size of the more there and what you will 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:38.150
 find 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:42.500
 Good. You'll find a rov. Thank you. 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:49.310
 listen not nailed old will not find a 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:51.260
 Omega ozark will find a flying saucer there 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:03:02.239
 the flying 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:05.510
 he should use it there where it will be good 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.060
 I do not know why I never had to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.950
 search for it 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.790
 On the other hand, we have a company there, it's me. 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.629
 I'm going to dive 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.540
 I think when I find the son of 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.269
 Bitch, I'll ask you there again. 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.569
 guys I came back here but the problem is that 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.760
 Michael was played, I do not know why. 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.519
 google and I think it was the exchange of 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.419
 characters some error asked at first 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.049
 hand a bug is this side of geddel is a 5 is 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.879
 because I have with him the expensive flying saucer 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.139
 It was really deep down you gotta get the 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.819
 submarine over there 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.410
 Only those who did not do the mission that the little mouth 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.060
 House has its manias 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.799
 so I've been diving, switching from 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.900
 character because when you switch between 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.459
 characters your breath replenishes do not get 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.769
 You can say that I've been playing a 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.319
 character until you get to the bottom with 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.060
 Frank then go back to where the brother is. 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.650
 that our flying saucer will taste very 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.629
 end of the brain 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.159
 about five times the character to 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.049
 O get there there before seeing the disk 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.000
 flying is a tasty place where you are 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.790
 correct location 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.949
 well it was already that we are there 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.120
 the tip of the map that has those islands 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.979
 It is here that city and has good record 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.520
 flying is right here today has this valley 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:29.360
 has this tip here the flying saucer is 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.849
 well here it's for you know now 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.740
 We are going back here with frank pacha here 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.090
 Old flying saucer is here I 'm without 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.449
 lighting is 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.740
 Look at your eye so much of water you have in 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.440
 The top of us can not see 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.690
 here's flying saucer is to vote for 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.690
 the characters that I stayed die 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.389
 it's this type I think the information 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.610
 of steroids leaked because they cook 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.460
 because some actually a person would 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.259
 I saw in this exact position the position of the map and 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.789
 will dive into what he said hell to see 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.710
 if you find an expensive flying saucer 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.330
 practically impossible 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.810
 Good was towed faster here. 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.810
 down 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.270
 Good, I think I already gave for these tregs. 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.680
 submerged UFO 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.360
 There's more down, it's just for 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.289
 show you how it's here 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:36.690
 Let's take a final look at it. 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:38.430
 look what to invent no furniture 3g s 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.199
 in this game and we are going to the next one that I 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.199
 I think it 's the coolest one there. 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.240
 Good, I just discovered that to see. 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.909
 you will find without finding the others we 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.130
 have 5 you need to close 100% of the game 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.370
 not only the story mode missions 100% 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.750
 type all than to everything in the game 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.599
 so I think it's going to take a 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.120
 bit to do this and when you 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:10.440
 makes use of tags that do not need 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.729
 is unlocking the game is then by 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.130
 this video do only those two in the 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.080
 It's true to make a video with everyone, but it's 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.599
 already realized that it will not roll 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.630
 this is what I will look for to bring two hotels 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.669
 by video until today how to give 100% of the game 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.889
 and show the rest of the ceresp to you 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.690
 thank you very much for being assisted and it is 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.690
 This spoke up until the next
