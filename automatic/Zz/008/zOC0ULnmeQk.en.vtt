come out with a new stick that you know

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.670 
come out with a new stick that you know
we've<00:00:18.660> seen<00:00:18.840> from<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.140> companies<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.620> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we've seen from some companies in the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
we've seen from some companies in the
past<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.370> a<00:00:20.610> lot<00:00:21.120> of<00:00:21.270> new<00:00:21.390> technology

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
past this is a lot of new technology

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
past this is a lot of new technology
coming<00:00:22.170> into<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.440> stick<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.520> thing<00:00:23.760> i

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
coming into this stick the first thing i

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.210 
coming into this stick the first thing i
want<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.060> talk<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.860> down<00:00:25.860> here<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.190> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
want to talk about is down here in the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
want to talk about is down here in the
taper<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.790> with<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.750> stealth<00:00:27.990> 6<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> past

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
taper as with the stealth 6 in the past

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.310 
taper as with the stealth 6 in the past
a<00:00:29.220> 17<00:00:29.850> s<00:00:30.060> 19<00:00:30.540> the<00:00:30.990> RS<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.320> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
a 17 s 19 the RS is and into the the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
a 17 s 19 the RS is and into the the
more<00:00:34.530> recent<00:00:34.890> v9<00:00:35.310> they<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.060> that<00:00:36.180> elliptical

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
more recent v9 they have that elliptical

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.590 
more recent v9 they have that elliptical
taper<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.950> real<00:00:38.340> thin<00:00:38.850> coming

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
taper so that's that real thin coming

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.570 
taper so that's that real thin coming
all<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.810> way<00:00:39.900> through<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.070> rounded

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
all the way through and the rounded

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.410 
all the way through and the rounded
sides<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
sides to it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.710 
sides to it
and<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> does<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.560> helps<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
and what that does is really helps to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.970 
and what that does is really helps to
keep<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.900> blades<00:00:46.170> square<00:00:46.650> when<00:00:46.860> you're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
keep the blades square when you're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.460 
keep the blades square when you're
shooting<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.490> prevents<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.210> torquing<00:00:48.810> but

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
shooting and prevents that torquing but

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.800 
shooting and prevents that torquing but
what<00:00:49.620> they<00:00:49.770> did<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.130> year<00:00:50.490> is<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
what they did this year is actually this

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.170 
what they did this year is actually this
is<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.380> true<00:00:52.890> one-piece<00:00:53.400> stick<00:00:53.700> one-piece

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is all a true one-piece stick one-piece

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.240 
is all a true one-piece stick one-piece
build<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.650> call<00:00:55.860> their<00:00:56.010> hyper

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
build and what they call their hyper

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.580 
build and what they call their hyper
light<00:00:56.550> technology<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.870> hyper<00:00:58.079> light<00:00:58.350> allows

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
light technology what hyper light allows

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.100 
light technology what hyper light allows
them<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.640> rid<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.149> extra

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
them to do is get rid of the extra

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.410 
them to do is get rid of the extra
composite<00:01:02.010> resin<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.880> that<00:01:03.060> stuff<00:01:03.300> that's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
composite resin all that stuff that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.540 
composite resin all that stuff that's
usually<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.140> taper<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.190> get<00:01:05.370> is<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
usually in this taper what you get is a

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.540 
usually in this taper what you get is a
overall<00:01:06.030> lighter<00:01:06.390> stick<00:01:06.720> better<00:01:07.229> balance<00:01:07.800> and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
overall lighter stick better balance and

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.680 
overall lighter stick better balance and
the<00:01:08.640> other<00:01:08.760> thing<00:01:08.940> it<00:01:09.030> does<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> create<00:01:09.600> when

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
the other thing it does is create when

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.120 
the other thing it does is create when
you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.930> bunch<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.680> stay<00:01:10.920> right

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you have a bunch of you know stay right

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.630 
you have a bunch of you know stay right
here

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
here

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
here
if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.120> bunch<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.390> extra<00:01:12.630> material<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
if you have a bunch of extra material in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
if you have a bunch of extra material in
the<00:01:13.530> middle<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:14.340> creating<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.940> stronger

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the middle you're creating a stronger

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
the middle you're creating a stronger
point<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.500> middle<00:01:16.830> point<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
point in this middle point so this is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.180 
point in this middle point so this is
strong<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.870> as<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> shoot<00:01:19.290> down<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.920> one

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
strong and as you shoot down it's one

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.070 
strong and as you shoot down it's one
it's<00:01:20.370> not<00:01:20.670> gonna<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.450> gonna<00:01:21.690> load<00:01:21.930> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's not gonna it's not gonna load as

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.110 
it's not gonna it's not gonna load as
evenly<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> shoot<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:24.000> also

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
evenly as you shoot and you're also

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.030 
evenly as you shoot and you're also
gonna<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.290> risk<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> break

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
gonna have you know more risk of a break

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.070 
gonna have you know more risk of a break
above<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:26.940> below<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.690> where<00:01:27.870> they're

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
above and below that point where they're

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.770 
above and below that point where they're
a<00:01:28.260> little<00:01:29.190> bit<00:01:29.369> weaker<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.820> can't<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> can't

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a little bit weaker and can't is can't

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.010 
a little bit weaker and can't is can't
take<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.110> stress<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.560> much<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:33.510> next<00:01:33.840> big

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
take that stress as much the next big

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.450 
take that stress as much the next big
thing<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.229> easton<00:01:34.619> did<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:34.979> stick<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
thing that easton did with this stick is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
thing that easton did with this stick is
the<00:01:36.030> EXO<00:01:36.420> rim<00:01:36.630> blade<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> x-ray<00:01:37.920> room

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the EXO rim blade what the x-ray room

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100 
the EXO rim blade what the x-ray room
blade<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.580> is<00:01:38.820> basically<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> structure

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
blade is is basically it's a structure

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
blade is is basically it's a structure
and<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.920> very<00:01:41.190> stiff<00:01:41.930> structure<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and a very very stiff structure that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.140 
and a very very stiff structure that
runs<00:01:43.170> around<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.040> very<00:01:44.430> outside<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
runs around the very outside of the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.450 
runs around the very outside of the
blade<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:46.439> works<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:47.010> of<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.159> theory

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
blade and it works kind of in theory

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
blade and it works kind of in theory
like<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.939> tennis<00:01:48.330> racket<00:01:48.689> with<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.350> outer

structure very very stiff and supportive

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.950 
structure very very stiff and supportive
it<00:01:52.439> helps<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> keep<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.520> entire<00:01:54.479> inside

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it helps to keep the entire inside

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.190 
it helps to keep the entire inside
stronger<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.450> one<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.780> help<00:01:57.840> your

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
stronger and one it's going to help your

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.359 
stronger and one it's going to help your
shooting<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> help<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.130> the

shooting that's going to help with the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.490 
shooting that's going to help with the
you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.659> blade<00:02:00.930> staying<00:02:01.290> square

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you know the blade staying square

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.830 
you know the blade staying square
through<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.950> shot<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.360> helping<00:02:03.810> to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
through the shot and really helping to

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
through the shot and really helping to
load<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.290> whole<00:02:04.439> thing<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.400> whole<00:02:05.580> blade

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.820 
load the whole thing up the whole blade
up<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.240> shooting<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:07.350> also<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
up as you're shooting it's also going to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.249 
up as you're shooting it's also going to
help<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.220> prevent<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.700> inside<00:02:09.479> foam<00:02:09.840> from

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
help to prevent the inside foam from

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
help to prevent the inside foam from
breaking<00:02:10.590> down<00:02:10.619> quite<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.099> quickly<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.639> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
breaking down quite as quickly so that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
breaking down quite as quickly so that
inside<00:02:12.540> foam

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
inside foam

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920

obviously<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:13.920> overtime<00:02:14.460> breaks<00:02:15.210> down<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
obviously as overtime breaks down you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.140 
obviously as overtime breaks down you
get<00:02:16.080> softer<00:02:16.620> blade<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:17.460> getting<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.760> much<00:02:17.850> pop

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
get softer blade not getting as much pop

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.620 
get softer blade not getting as much pop
on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.360> shots<00:02:19.070> this<00:02:20.070> outside<00:02:20.730> EXO<00:02:21.180> rim<00:02:21.360> blade

towards the toe of the stick and kind of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
towards the toe of the stick and kind of
create<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.760> slingshot<00:02:33.120> effect<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
create that slingshot effect so a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900 
create that slingshot effect so a
stronger<00:02:34.320> blade<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:35.100> gonna<00:02:35.340> help<00:02:35.640> with<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
stronger blade is gonna help with that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.090 
stronger blade is gonna help with that
and<00:02:36.090> create<00:02:36.360> more<00:02:36.540> velocity<00:02:36.950> through<00:02:37.950> the

and create more velocity through the
stick

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
stick

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.230 
stick
the<00:02:39.150> last<00:02:39.510> major<00:02:39.810> addition<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> stick<00:02:40.740> is

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the last major addition to the stick is

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.410 
the last major addition to the stick is
Easton's<00:02:42.240> x<00:02:42.540> xt<00:02:43.440> x<00:02:43.860> resin<00:02:44.640> matrix<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.210> what<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
Easton's x xt x resin matrix and what it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.510 
Easton's x xt x resin matrix and what it
is<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.690> basically<00:02:45.720> an<00:02:46.080> epoxy<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:47.250> runs

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
is it's basically an epoxy that runs

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.370 
is it's basically an epoxy that runs
through<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> stick<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.960> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> help

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
through the stick and it's going to help

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.500 
through the stick and it's going to help
with<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.770> help<00:02:50.610> with<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.790> durability<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
with the help with the durability of the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.200 
with the help with the durability of the
stick<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.050> it's<00:02:52.830> got<00:02:53.010> higher<00:02:53.370> impact<00:02:53.880> strength

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
stick so it's got higher impact strength

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.940 
stick so it's got higher impact strength
than<00:02:54.660> what<00:02:54.990> they've<00:02:55.140> used<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.530> past<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
than what they've used in the past and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.470 
than what they've used in the past and
this<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.190> something<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.730> material<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
this is something this material is

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.660 
this is something this material is
something<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.870> Easton<00:02:58.550> created<00:02:59.550> themselves

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
something that Easton created themselves

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.790 
something that Easton created themselves
for<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.900> PERT<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.140> know<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> purpose<00:03:01.680> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
for the PERT you know for the purpose of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.220 
for the PERT you know for the purpose of
this<00:03:02.040> stick<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.660> got<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> higher<00:03:04.020> impact

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
this stick and it's got a higher impact

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.660 
this stick and it's got a higher impact
strength<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.950> gets<00:03:05.100> hit<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.400> gonna<00:03:05.550> be

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
strength so it gets hit it's gonna be

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.070 
strength so it gets hit it's gonna be
able<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.030> hit<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.660> little<00:03:06.960> bit

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
able to take that hit a little bit

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.040 
able to take that hit a little bit
better<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:08.360> different<00:03:09.360> from<00:03:09.390> many<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.990> the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
better but different from many of the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.810 
better but different from many of the
other<00:03:10.080> resins<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.130> on<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.280> market<00:03:11.670> is

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
other resins like that on the market is

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120 
other resins like that on the market is
it<00:03:12.540> has<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> lot<00:03:12.990> better<00:03:13.200> stretch<00:03:13.650> properties

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
it has a lot better stretch properties

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.800 
it has a lot better stretch properties
so<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.970> help<00:03:15.090> load<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.420> stick<00:03:15.780> a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
so it's going to help load the stick a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.020 
so it's going to help load the stick a
lot<00:03:15.990> easier<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:17.100> react<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.700> create<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
lot easier and really react and create a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.540 
lot easier and really react and create a
more<00:03:18.270> responsive<00:03:18.900> stick<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.410> I've<00:03:20.400> been

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
more responsive stick and I've been

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.330 
more responsive stick and I've been
