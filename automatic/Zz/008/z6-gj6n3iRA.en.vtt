00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.510

 Hmm 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060

 In 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.290
 DEA 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 DEA 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.380
 As long as straight part behind 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.180
 As a tail 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.990
 In the form of pulling out 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.990
 I will stop winding 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.380
 Learn this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.100
 It's like having a roll of sweat and sweat like this 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 Depending on 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 It depends on you 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.400
 In a drunk state 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.290
 I will roll forward to the front 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.900
 so 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.380

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.990
 I will stop at 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.680
 So much 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.680
 Cut 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.950
 And 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 That little bit of learning 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.430
 It is a part of the root, still some of this part 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.060
 Even 56 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.319
 It is made 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.630
 And 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:34.910
 From the Mashiko match of the part I stopped earlier 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.250
 It's a vacant part, and it's on here . 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.090
 Here 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 in this way 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.230
 It will stop winding 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.230
 so 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.000
 so 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.710
 It It was very good 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:03.980
 And after you go to Mario Kart, it's kinda nice to this Ainu paperback 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.069
 What sheets 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.629
 Roll around 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.629
 And the finish 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.260
 And as 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 Head cement 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.840
