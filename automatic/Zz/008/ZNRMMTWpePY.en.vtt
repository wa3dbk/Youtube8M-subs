00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
there so it going into my opinion on the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
there so it going into my opinion on the
sprocket<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.520> looks<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.000> good

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
sprocket I think it looks really good
it's<00:01:10.049> pretty<00:01:10.350> beefy<00:01:10.530> let<00:01:11.280> me<00:01:11.369> bring<00:01:11.549> another
