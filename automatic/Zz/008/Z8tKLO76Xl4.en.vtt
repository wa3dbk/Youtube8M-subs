house<00:00:31.260> isn't<00:00:31.619> really<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.130> house<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.640> saw

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
house isn't really a house that I saw

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.729 
house isn't really a house that I saw
while<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> were<00:00:33.360> traveling<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.170> saw<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> few

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
while we were traveling but I saw a few

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
while we were traveling but I saw a few
that<00:00:34.860> looked<00:00:35.040> similar<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.969> then<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that looked similar to it and then I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.790 
that looked similar to it and then I
decided<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.750> spice<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.260> things<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.649> by

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
decided to spice some things up by

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.729 
decided to spice some things up by
adding<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.309> pool<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> second<00:00:39.600> level<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
adding a pool on the second level so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
adding a pool on the second level so
this<00:00:41.100> house<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.579> calling<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> aquarium<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
this house I'm calling the aquarium and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
this house I'm calling the aquarium and
it's<00:00:43.770> called<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:44.910> have

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it's called that because I actually have

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
it's called that because I actually have
windows<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> pool<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
windows into the pool on this on the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.209 
windows into the pool on this on the
first<00:00:47.579> floor<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> little

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
first floor and actually in the little

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639 
first floor and actually in the little
dining<00:00:50.610> nook<00:00:50.820> area<00:00:51.180> there's<00:00:51.719> windows<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
dining nook area there's windows to the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.750 
dining nook area there's windows to the
pool<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.370> looks<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.579> an

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
pool so it kind of looks like an

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.119 
pool so it kind of looks like an
aquarium<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.510> watch<00:00:54.690> people

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
aquarium and you can watch people

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
aquarium and you can watch people
swimming<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.140> whatnot<00:00:58.140> while<00:00:58.530> you're<00:00:58.770> eating

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
swimming and whatnot while you're eating

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.119 
swimming and whatnot while you're eating
which<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.399> thought<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.670> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> cool<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
which I thought was kind of cool and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.759 
which I thought was kind of cool and
it's<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:03.090> big<00:01:03.300> house<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
it's it's not a very big house and I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's it's not a very big house and I
think<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> costs<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.489> eighty<00:01:05.880> thousand

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
think it costs about eighty thousand

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.830 
think it costs about eighty thousand
simoleons<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.700> there's<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.420> only<00:01:09.510> room

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
simoleons but there's really only room

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
simoleons but there's really only room
for<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.080> three<00:01:10.409> sims<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.979> house<00:01:11.159> maybe

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
for about three sims in this house maybe

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.660 
for about three sims in this house maybe
only<00:01:12.330> two<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> child's<00:01:14.189> room<00:01:14.400> in

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
only two I do have a child's room in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
only two I do have a child's room in
this<00:01:14.880> house<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> wouldn't<00:01:16.229> recommend
