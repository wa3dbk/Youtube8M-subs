at me not looking away from the dog

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.030 
at me not looking away from the dog
because<00:06:55.990> the<00:06:56.020> problem<00:06:56.440> is<00:06:56.560> when<00:06:56.710> he<00:06:56.740> sees<00:06:56.980> a

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
because the problem is when he sees a

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.610 
because the problem is when he sees a
dog<00:06:57.510> right<00:06:58.510> so<00:06:59.050> there's<00:06:59.230> no<00:06:59.290> sit<00:07:00.070> look<00:07:00.610> at<00:07:00.730> me

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.280 
dog right so there's no sit look at me
you<00:07:02.620> know<00:07:02.650> go<00:07:03.490> the<00:07:03.670> other<00:07:03.790> way<00:07:03.960> when<00:07:04.960> he<00:07:05.110> sees

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
you know go the other way when he sees

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.680 
you know go the other way when he sees
dogs<00:07:05.560> you<00:07:06.400> know<00:07:06.520> closer<00:07:06.880> closer<00:07:07.300> closer

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
dogs you know closer closer closer

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.020 
dogs you know closer closer closer
because<00:07:08.380> this<00:07:08.500> is<00:07:08.650> seriously<00:07:09.070> gradual<00:07:09.460> this

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
because this is seriously gradual this

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.700 
because this is seriously gradual this
is<00:07:10.210> not<00:07:10.360> if<00:07:10.720> it's<00:07:10.900> weak<00:07:11.110> aggression<00:07:11.590> it's

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
is not if it's weak aggression it's

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.230 
is not if it's weak aggression it's
really<00:07:11.920> not<00:07:12.130> aggression<00:07:12.490> and<00:07:12.790> it<00:07:12.850> appears<00:07:13.120> to

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
really not aggression and it appears to

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.020 
really not aggression and it appears to
be<00:07:13.270> aggression<00:07:13.780> I<00:07:13.930> mean<00:07:14.650> we<00:07:15.370> get<00:07:15.490> those<00:07:15.640> cases

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
be aggression I mean we get those cases

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.250 
be aggression I mean we get those cases
too<00:07:16.180> and<00:07:16.300> that's<00:07:16.360> a<00:07:16.510> piece<00:07:16.660> of<00:07:16.810> cake<00:07:16.930> and<00:07:17.140> one

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
too and that's a piece of cake and one

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.770 
too and that's a piece of cake and one
two<00:07:17.410> three<00:07:17.710> we<00:07:17.860> fix<00:07:18.070> out<00:07:18.190> a<00:07:18.220> class<00:07:18.430> or<00:07:18.610> two<00:07:18.780> this

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
two three we fix out a class or two this

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.300 
two three we fix out a class or two this
is<00:07:19.960> going<00:07:20.110> to<00:07:20.170> take<00:07:20.350> some<00:07:20.530> effort<00:07:21.030> stay<00:07:22.030> tuned
