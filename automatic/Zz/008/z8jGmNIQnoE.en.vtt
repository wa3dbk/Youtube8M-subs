00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.810
 the airport and the military base for 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.789
 so that we can create activities 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 what the fuck inside the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.330

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760
 rockstar authorizes us to do it I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.320

 so in addition to his rockstar announced 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.129
 currently working on a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530
 day that would allow the creators so 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.090
 activities to be able to re-enact 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.770
 containers and ramps a lot more 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
