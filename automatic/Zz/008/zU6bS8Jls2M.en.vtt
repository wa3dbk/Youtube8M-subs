00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.849 
and you repeat that section twice for
the<00:02:14.859> introduction<00:02:16.349> okay<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.469> then<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:17.650> verse

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it's pretty much the same thing the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.989 
it's pretty much the same thing the
first<00:02:19.719> verse<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:19.989> slightly<00:02:20.379> different<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.999> the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
first verse is slightly different to the

of the verse is pretty much the same as

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.380 
of the verse is pretty much the same as
the<00:03:47.770> introduction<00:03:48.190> which<00:03:48.610> you<00:03:48.790> did<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.240> minute

with<00:03:58.630> their<00:03:58.810> second<00:03:59.230> round<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.530> D<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.950> then

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
with their second round the D and then

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.810 
with their second round the D and then
an<00:04:00.280> open<00:04:00.840> D<00:04:01.840> string<00:04:01.890> do<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.070> three<00:04:03.310> times<00:04:03.340> and

an open D string do that three times and
then<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.210> same<00:04:04.740> fourth<00:04:05.740> line<00:04:05.980> you've<00:04:06.130> just

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
then the same fourth line you've just

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.940 
then the same fourth line you've just
done<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> moment<00:04:06.760> ago

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
so that's the two verses before the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.250 
so that's the two verses before the
first<00:04:17.380> chorus<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:19.299> first<00:04:19.540> chorus<00:04:19.900> could

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
first chorus and the first chorus could

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.600 
first chorus and the first chorus could
be<00:04:20.350> an<00:04:20.410> F<00:04:20.590> chord<00:04:20.920> but<00:04:21.190> you're<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.519> now

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
be an F chord but you're going to now

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.460 
be an F chord but you're going to now
need<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.880> use<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:23.050> baseline<00:04:24.240> million<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.720> on

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
need to use the baseline million in on

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.200 
need to use the baseline million in on
the<00:04:26.560> E<00:04:26.710> string<00:04:26.790> first<00:04:27.790> fret<00:04:27.910> on<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.090> E<00:04:28.180> string

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210

which is the first part of the course so

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.660 
which is the first part of the course so

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
four times you do the third fret of E

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.170 
four times you do the third fret of E
string

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180
