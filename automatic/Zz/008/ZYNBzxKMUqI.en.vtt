00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we purchased this because we're going on

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.680 
we purchased this because we're going on
a<00:00:35.940> trip<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.680> need<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:38.879> anticipate

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a trip and we need or we anticipate

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.020 
a trip and we need or we anticipate
having<00:00:40.079> some<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.280> where<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> be

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
having some time where we're going to be

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.060 
having some time where we're going to be
away<00:00:42.270> from<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:44.390> an<00:00:45.390> electrical<00:00:45.989> source<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.559> so

away from a an electrical source and so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549 
away from a an electrical source and so
we<00:00:47.460> figured<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.850> might<00:00:48.030> need<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.320> bit<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.830 
we figured we might need a little bit of
extra<00:00:49.739> juice<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.789> keep<00:00:50.969> our<00:00:51.090> phones<00:00:51.300> charged

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
extra juice to keep our phones charged

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and ready to go while we're on the trip

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
and ready to go while we're on the trip

battery<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.739> low<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.209> shines<00:02:33.390> blue

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
battery is low and if it shines blue

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.320 
battery is low and if it shines blue
apparently<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.799> you've<00:02:35.370> got<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.610> pretty<00:02:36.150> much

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
apparently the you've got a pretty much

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.390 
apparently the you've got a pretty much
a<00:02:36.360> full<00:02:36.600> charge<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.560> battery<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:38.190> another

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
a full charge on the battery but another

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.620 
a full charge on the battery but another
cool<00:02:38.610> feature<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.000> if<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.209> press<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.569> button

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
cool feature is if you press this button

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.020 
cool feature is if you press this button
twice<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.799> turns<00:02:41.190> into<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:41.819> mini

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
twice it turns into a little mini

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.850 
twice it turns into a little mini
flashlight<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.470> turn<00:02:46.590> off<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
flashlight and then to turn off the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.180 
flashlight and then to turn off the
flashlight<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.430> press<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.730> twice<00:02:47.819> so<00:02:49.190> this

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
flashlight just press it twice so this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.410

little<00:02:50.430> button<00:02:50.580> right<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.030> kind<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
little button right here is kind of the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.339 
little button right here is kind of the
the<00:02:51.660> main<00:02:51.840> control<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:53.630> everything<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.140> here

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
the main control for everything so here

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.140 
the main control for everything so here
is<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> cable<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.430> came<00:02:56.610> along<00:02:56.819> with<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
is the cable that came along with it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.699 
is the cable that came along with it
it's<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.360> pretty<00:02:57.510> standard<00:02:57.959> looking<00:02:57.989> cable<00:02:58.590> I'm

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
it's a pretty standard looking cable I'm

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.130 
it's a pretty standard looking cable I'm
sure<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.010> you've<00:02:59.190> got<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> phone<00:03:00.360> you've

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
sure if you've got a phone you've

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.390 
sure if you've got a phone you've
probably<00:03:01.440> seen<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.950> before<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
probably seen this before this is a a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.819 
probably seen this before this is a a
microUSB<00:03:06.200> side<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:07.440> you've<00:03:07.560> got<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
microUSB side and then you've got the

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.420 
microUSB side and then you've got the
standard<00:03:08.220> USB<00:03:08.730> end<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:10.170> charge<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.100> battery

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
standard USB end to charge the battery

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.340 
standard USB end to charge the battery
simply<00:03:12.320> insert<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.799> microUSB<00:03:15.109> into<00:03:16.109> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
simply insert the the microUSB into the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.250 
simply insert the the microUSB into the
in<00:03:16.790> position<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.410> then<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.750> would<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:21.900> plug

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
in position and then you would just plug

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.940 
in position and then you would just plug
this<00:03:22.440> into<00:03:22.940> any<00:03:23.940> power<00:03:24.269> source<00:03:24.680> USB<00:03:25.680> power

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
this into any power source USB power

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.500 
this into any power source USB power
source<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> laptop<00:03:26.850> computer<00:03:27.030> that's

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
source so a laptop computer that's

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.140 
source so a laptop computer that's
plugged<00:03:27.690> into<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.019> wall<00:03:28.049> or<00:03:28.880> one<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.000> your

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
plugged into the wall or one of your

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.140 
plugged into the wall or one of your
iPod<00:03:31.760> adapters<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:34.530> then<00:03:35.040> after<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.819> gets<00:03:36.060> a

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
iPod adapters and then after this gets a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.960 
iPod adapters and then after this gets a
full<00:03:36.329> charge<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:38.250> should<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.579> able<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.760> see

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
full charge you should be able to see

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.530 
full charge you should be able to see
that<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.299> light<00:03:39.660> will<00:03:40.200> shine<00:03:40.880> blue<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.799> then

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
that this light will shine blue and then

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.160 
that this light will shine blue and then
you're<00:03:45.540> good<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.930> go

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
you're good to go

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.370 
you're good to go
so<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:46.859> were<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:46.980> unplug<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:49.200> then

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
so if you were to unplug this and then

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.170 
so if you were to unplug this and then
you<00:03:49.590> could<00:03:49.769> take<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:51.049> standard<00:03:52.850> Apple<00:03:53.850> cable

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
you could take your standard Apple cable

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.729 
you could take your standard Apple cable
which<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.720> currently<00:03:55.019> don't<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:55.470> right<00:03:55.709> now

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
which I currently don't have right now

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.270 
which I currently don't have right now
but<00:03:56.010> will<00:03:56.989> well<00:03:57.989> we'll<00:03:58.230> use<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.859> little

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
but will well we'll use that a little

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.190 
but will well we'll use that a little
bit<00:03:59.400> after<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.359> thing<00:04:00.540> gets<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.810> full<00:04:00.989> charge

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
bit after this thing gets a full charge

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.490 
bit after this thing gets a full charge
and<00:04:01.500> we'll<00:04:01.709> test<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.250> out<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.430> my<00:04:02.639> iPhone<00:04:03.500> then

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
and we'll test it out on my iPhone then

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.650 
and we'll test it out on my iPhone then
you<00:04:04.709> would<00:04:04.859> take<00:04:05.250> your<00:04:05.549> your<00:04:05.970> your<00:04:06.299> cable

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
you would take your your your cable

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.220 
you would take your your your cable
failure<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:07.440> your<00:04:07.560> iPhone

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
failure for your iPhone

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.729 
failure for your iPhone
and<00:04:09.319> then<00:04:10.180> I'll<00:04:12.430> plug<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.580> into<00:04:13.870> here<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:15.470> this

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
and then I'll plug it into here on this

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.710 
and then I'll plug it into here on this
side<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:18.139> then<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.970> course<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.449> other<00:04:20.600> and

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720

been reading that you could get about

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.340 
been reading that you could get about
almost<00:04:28.280> three<00:04:28.490> full<00:04:29.060> charges<00:04:29.479> on<00:04:29.870> your<00:04:30.139> phone

using this so I'll be using that

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.510 
using this so I'll be using that
benchmark<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:34.070> kind<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:35.290> compare<00:04:36.520> the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
benchmark to kind of compare the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.600 
benchmark to kind of compare the
performance<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.300> four<00:04:38.600> with<00:04:38.930> my<00:04:39.080> phones

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
I'll give a little bit of a review on

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.140 
I'll give a little bit of a review on
how<00:05:03.919> well<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:04.310> thing<00:05:04.550> can<00:05:04.699> charge<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.060> up

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
how well this thing can charge you up

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.960 
how well this thing can charge you up
some<00:05:05.449> of<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.600> phones<00:05:05.780> so<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.199> will<00:05:07.190> check<00:05:07.639> back

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
some of the phones so I will check back

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.040 
some of the phones so I will check back
with<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.419> later<00:05:13.389> so<00:05:14.389> we've<00:05:14.570> had<00:05:14.690> this<00:05:14.840> sitting

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
with you later so we've had this sitting

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.270 
with you later so we've had this sitting
on<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.349> charger<00:05:15.680> for<00:05:15.950> about<00:05:16.300> maybe<00:05:17.300> six<00:05:17.780> hours

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
on the charger for about maybe six hours

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.029 
on the charger for about maybe six hours
and<00:05:19.280> I<00:05:19.820> checked<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.470> we've<00:05:21.470> got<00:05:21.500> blue

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
and I checked it and we've got blue

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.240 
and I checked it and we've got blue
which<00:05:22.849> indicates<00:05:23.300> it's<00:05:23.510> got<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:24.039> pretty<00:05:25.039> much<00:05:25.220> a

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
which indicates it's got a pretty much a

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.550 
which indicates it's got a pretty much a
full<00:05:25.490> charge<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.960> we're<00:05:27.080> gonna<00:05:27.169> go<00:05:27.320> ahead<00:05:27.440> and

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
full charge so we're gonna go ahead and

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
full charge so we're gonna go ahead and
test<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.889> out<00:05:29.050> I've<00:05:30.050> got<00:05:30.200> a<00:05:30.280> iPhone<00:05:31.280> five<00:05:31.700> here

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
test it out I've got a iPhone five here

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.830 
test it out I've got a iPhone five here
and<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.729> can<00:05:34.910> see<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.180> sitting<00:05:35.450> right<00:05:35.599> at

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
and you can see it sitting right at

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.040 
and you can see it sitting right at
about<00:05:37.030> 62%<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:39.620> it's<00:05:40.490> not<00:05:40.789> being<00:05:41.090> charged<00:05:41.479> so

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
about 62% and it's not being charged so

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.110 
about 62% and it's not being charged so
what<00:05:42.200> we're<00:05:42.320> gonna<00:05:42.440> do<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:43.610> we're<00:05:43.820> gonna<00:05:43.910> plug

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.610 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug
it<00:05:44.270> in<00:05:44.919> plug<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.039> into<00:05:46.190> here<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:48.080> immediately

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
it in plug it into here and immediately

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.080 
it in plug it into here and immediately
it<00:05:49.340> charges<00:05:50.210> up<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:52.280> is<00:05:52.460> currently<00:05:52.849> being

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
it charges up so it is currently being

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.469 
it charges up so it is currently being
charged<00:05:53.599> I'm<00:05:54.289> gonna<00:05:54.530> let<00:05:54.710> this<00:05:54.860> sit<00:05:55.389> just<00:05:56.389> for

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
charged I'm gonna let this sit just for

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.300 
charged I'm gonna let this sit just for
a<00:05:56.539> few<00:05:56.720> minutes<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.229> then<00:05:57.830> we're<00:05:57.979> gonna<00:05:58.099> come

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
a few minutes and then we're gonna come

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.159 
a few minutes and then we're gonna come
back<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.490> see<00:05:58.789> how<00:05:58.970> much<00:05:59.150> it<00:05:59.270> changes<00:05:59.630> about

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
back and see how much it changes about

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.189 
back and see how much it changes about
62%<00:06:00.710> all<00:06:01.190> the<00:06:01.310> way<00:06:01.370> up<00:06:01.460> to<00:06:02.919> 85%<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.870> matter<00:06:06.080> of

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
62% all the way up to 85% in a matter of

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.370 
62% all the way up to 85% in a matter of
about<00:06:06.440> 10<00:06:06.770> minutes<00:06:07.000> so<00:06:08.000> over<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.840> 20<00:06:09.199> percent

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
about 10 minutes so over a 20 percent

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.370 
about 10 minutes so over a 20 percent
gain<00:06:09.830> in<00:06:09.860> battery<00:06:10.460> power<00:06:11.050> over<00:06:12.050> 20<00:06:12.289> percent

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
gain in battery power over 20 percent

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.790 
gain in battery power over 20 percent
gain<00:06:12.710> in<00:06:12.740> battery<00:06:13.099> power<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:14.470> would<00:06:15.470> say<00:06:15.680> this

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
gain in battery power I would say this

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.980 
gain in battery power I would say this
thing<00:06:16.010> is<00:06:16.039> working<00:06:16.220> pretty<00:06:16.460> well<00:06:16.719> let's<00:06:17.719> check

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
thing is working pretty well let's check

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.860 
thing is working pretty well let's check
the<00:06:18.200> light<00:06:18.380> it's<00:06:19.010> still<00:06:19.280> blue<00:06:19.990> so

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
the light it's still blue so

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.780 
the light it's still blue so
looks<00:06:22.770> like<00:06:22.889> it's<00:06:23.070> charging<00:06:23.370> up<00:06:23.639> pretty

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
looks like it's charging up pretty

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.770 
looks like it's charging up pretty
nicely<00:06:24.030> so<00:06:25.160> I'm<00:06:26.160> gonna<00:06:26.310> let<00:06:26.490> this<00:06:26.610> sit<00:06:26.880> for<00:06:27.120> a

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
nicely so I'm gonna let this sit for a

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.230 
nicely so I'm gonna let this sit for a
much<00:06:28.169> longer<00:06:28.440> period<00:06:28.560> of<00:06:28.740> time<00:06:29.180> we're<00:06:30.180> gonna

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
much longer period of time we're gonna

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.210 
much longer period of time we're gonna
charge<00:06:30.600> this<00:06:30.900> up<00:06:30.960> or<00:06:31.440> we're<00:06:31.560> gonna<00:06:31.620> use<00:06:32.010> this

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
charge this up or we're gonna use this

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.960 
charge this up or we're gonna use this
on<00:06:32.490> a<00:06:32.520> number<00:06:33.330> of<00:06:33.360> different<00:06:33.570> charges<00:06:34.970> for

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
on a number of different charges for

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.390 
on a number of different charges for
different<00:06:36.210> for<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.380> iPhone<00:06:37.740> 5<00:06:38.010> and<00:06:38.570> a<00:06:39.570> 4s<00:06:40.560> and

different for this iPhone 5 and a 4s and
we'll<00:06:42.120> see<00:06:42.720> how<00:06:42.870> well<00:06:43.050> it<00:06:43.139> performs<00:06:43.410> how<00:06:43.590> many

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
we'll see how well it performs how many

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.420 
we'll see how well it performs how many
charges<00:06:44.070> in<00:06:44.630> 24<00:06:45.630> hours<00:06:45.960> since<00:06:46.169> the<00:06:46.350> last<00:06:46.830> test

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
charges in 24 hours since the last test

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.530 
charges in 24 hours since the last test
and<00:06:47.730> we<00:06:47.910> were<00:06:48.030> able<00:06:48.180> to<00:06:48.330> get<00:06:48.570> three<00:06:50.540> full

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
and we were able to get three full

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.090 
and we were able to get three full
charges<00:06:51.840> on<00:06:52.169> our<00:06:52.290> cell<00:06:52.470> phones<00:06:52.650> our<00:06:52.950> cell

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
charges on our cell phones our cell

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.590 
charges on our cell phones our cell
phones<00:06:53.280> weren't<00:06:53.460> completely<00:06:53.940> dead<00:06:54.180> but<00:06:54.450> they

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
phones weren't completely dead but they

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.590 
phones weren't completely dead but they
were<00:06:55.100> below<00:06:56.100> 50%<00:06:56.460> each<00:06:56.970> time<00:06:57.270> and<00:06:57.479> we<00:06:57.540> were

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
were below 50% each time and we were

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.900 
were below 50% each time and we were
able<00:06:57.720> to<00:06:57.840> get<00:06:57.990> three<00:06:58.229> charges<00:06:58.560> before<00:06:58.950> we

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
able to get three charges before we

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.030 
able to get three charges before we
started<00:07:00.240> noticing<00:07:00.389> the<00:07:00.960> light<00:07:01.380> change<00:07:01.710> on

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
started noticing the light change on

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.360 
started noticing the light change on
this<00:07:02.460> battery<00:07:03.560> so<00:07:04.560> I<00:07:04.590> would<00:07:04.830> say<00:07:04.950> that<00:07:05.100> this<00:07:05.190> is

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
this battery so I would say that this is

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.270 
this battery so I would say that this is
a<00:07:05.400> very<00:07:05.639> good<00:07:05.940> little<00:07:06.419> battery<00:07:07.280> something

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
a very good little battery something
