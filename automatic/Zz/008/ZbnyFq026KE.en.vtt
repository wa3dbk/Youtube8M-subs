welcome<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.040> my<00:00:08.099> unboxing<00:00:08.309> your<00:00:08.610> first<00:00:08.849> look

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
welcome to my unboxing your first look

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.110 
welcome to my unboxing your first look
at<00:00:09.380> something<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.530> we've<00:00:10.710> kind<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.820> looked

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
at something that we've kind of looked

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.440 
at something that we've kind of looked
at<00:00:12.269> before<00:00:12.719> but<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.170> quite<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
at before but not quite this is the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.410 
at before but not quite this is the
Western<00:00:15.450> Digital<00:00:15.630> my<00:00:16.470> book<00:00:17.180> velociraptor<00:00:18.180> duo

Western Digital my book velociraptor duo
so<00:00:18.779> we've<00:00:18.960> already<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> look<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.279> their

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
so we've already had a look at their

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.509 
so we've already had a look at their
other<00:00:21.029> jewel<00:00:21.510> drive<00:00:21.949> thunderbolt<00:00:22.949> enclosure

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
other jewel drive thunderbolt enclosure

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.150 
other jewel drive thunderbolt enclosure
which<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.600> had<00:00:24.840> green<00:00:25.230> drives<00:00:25.650> inside

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
which actually had green drives inside

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.000 
which actually had green drives inside
which<00:00:26.519> means<00:00:26.789> you've<00:00:27.090> got<00:00:27.269> bigger<00:00:27.660> capacity

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
which means you've got bigger capacity

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.429 
which means you've got bigger capacity
so<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:30.029> 4<00:00:30.449> terabyte<00:00:31.050> model

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
so that one was a 4 terabyte model

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.040 
so that one was a 4 terabyte model
whereas<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.550> only<00:00:32.850> 2<00:00:33.329> terabytes<00:00:33.899> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
whereas this one is only 2 terabytes of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.100 
whereas this one is only 2 terabytes of
total<00:00:34.320> capacity<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.940> big<00:00:36.420> difference<00:00:36.600> is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
total capacity but the big difference is

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200 
total capacity but the big difference is
this<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.620> instead<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.129> those<00:00:38.250> screen<00:00:38.910> drives

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this one instead of those screen drives

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.369 
this one instead of those screen drives
which<00:00:39.390> spin<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> around<00:00:41.120> 5400<00:00:42.120> rpm<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:43.050> two

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
which spin it around 5400 rpm has two

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
which spin it around 5400 rpm has two
drives<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.950> been<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> green<00:00:44.960> 10,000<00:00:45.960> rpm<00:00:46.350> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
drives that's been a green 10,000 rpm so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
drives that's been a green 10,000 rpm so
we're<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:47.010> more<00:00:47.309> performance<00:00:48.000> faster

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we're gonna have more performance faster

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.770 
we're gonna have more performance faster
response<00:00:49.379> times<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> lower<00:00:50.969> capacity<00:00:51.210> but

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
response times and lower capacity but

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
response times and lower capacity but
more<00:00:52.590> performance<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.370> faster<00:00:53.489> response

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
more performance and faster response

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
more performance and faster response
times<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.690> Thunderbolt<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.649> all

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
times which is what Thunderbolt is all

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.369 
times which is what Thunderbolt is all
about<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.570> WD<00:00:57.960> I've<00:00:58.140> already

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
about so let's see what WD I've already

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
about so let's see what WD I've already
done<00:00:58.530> my<00:00:58.559> spiel<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.250> let's<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.640> they

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
done my spiel but let's see what they

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.049

so<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.860> pretty<00:01:23.040> much<00:01:23.100> covered<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.270> let's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so we pretty much covered this so let's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
so we pretty much covered this so let's
open<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> look<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
open it up and have a look at what this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.429 
open it up and have a look at what this
one<00:01:26.640> looks<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:27.000> compared<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> other<00:01:28.229> one

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
one looks like compared to the other one

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
one looks like compared to the other one
that<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.860> did<00:01:29.009> already<00:01:29.310> unbox<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.450> am

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that we did already unbox and I am

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
that we did already unbox and I am
expecting<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.380> similar<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
expecting it to look very similar so we

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
expecting it to look very similar so we
have<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.090> brick<00:01:33.979> we<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.630> really<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
have a power brick we have really it

the box and then being surprised by

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.650 
the box and then being surprised by
things<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.830> shouldn't<00:02:17.100> surprise<00:02:17.280> us<00:02:17.660> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660

know what we should do just for giggle

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.500 
know what we should do just for giggle
since<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.250> might<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.610> actually<00:02:20.820> open<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
since I might not actually open the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
since I might not actually open the
enclosure<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.200> uh<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:23.550> should<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:23.910> be

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
enclosure is uh we should go be

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.220 
enclosure is uh we should go be
surprised<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:26.060> Western<00:02:27.060> Digital

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
surprised that we have a Western Digital

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.910 
surprised that we have a Western Digital
velociraptor<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.020> our<00:02:34.170> Velociraptor

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
velociraptor so this is our Velociraptor

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
velociraptor so this is our Velociraptor
let's<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.520> our<00:02:35.760> Velociraptor<00:02:36.510> it's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
let's just see if our Velociraptor it's

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.180 
let's just see if our Velociraptor it's
the<00:02:36.720> same<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.080> their<00:02:37.260> Velociraptor<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.010> let's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the same as their Velociraptor but let's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.530 
the same as their Velociraptor but let's
take<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> look<00:02:38.520> at<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.240> enclosure

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
take a look at the at the enclosure

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
take a look at the at the enclosure
first<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.290> about<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.770> size<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.220> two

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
first so it's about the size of two

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.680 
first so it's about the size of two
three<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> half<00:02:41.820> inch<00:02:42.030> drives<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.570> guys

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
three and a half inch drives if you guys

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.930 
three and a half inch drives if you guys
aren't<00:02:42.900> sure<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.320> scale<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:44.610> would

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
aren't sure of the scale and I would

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.000 
aren't sure of the scale and I would
also<00:02:45.090> love<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> traditional<00:02:46.170> iPhone

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
also love to do the traditional iPhone

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
also love to do the traditional iPhone
size<00:02:47.370> comparison<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.090> know<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.360> been<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> while

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
size comparison I know it's been a while

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.480 
size comparison I know it's been a while
since<00:02:48.990> I've<00:02:49.200> pulled<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.530> out<00:02:49.770> there<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.310> go

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
since I've pulled this out there you go

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.940 
since I've pulled this out there you go
iPhone<00:02:51.330> size<00:02:51.630> comparison<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.410> now<00:02:52.530> y'all<00:02:52.740> will

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
iPhone size comparison so now y'all will

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.490 
iPhone size comparison so now y'all will
know<00:02:53.040> how<00:02:53.190> big<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.670> lots<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.570> cooling<00:02:54.960> you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
know how big it is lots of cooling you

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.080 
know how big it is lots of cooling you
can<00:02:55.650> see<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.070> there's<00:02:56.280> passive<00:02:56.790> ventilation

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
can see here there's passive ventilation

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210 
can see here there's passive ventilation
going<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.050> bottom<00:02:58.230> passive

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
going on in the bottom passive

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.830 
going on in the bottom passive
ventilation<00:02:59.460> going<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.300> top<00:03:00.510> heat

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
ventilation going on in the top heat

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440 
ventilation going on in the top heat
does<00:03:01.110> naturally<00:03:01.770> rise<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.670> you'll<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.150> cool

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
does naturally rise so you'll get cool

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.180 
does naturally rise so you'll get cool
air<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:03.989> these<00:03:04.200> feet<00:03:04.530> are<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.890> tall

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
air because these feet are so tall

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.979 
air because these feet are so tall
coming<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.090> through<00:03:06.390> through<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.690> bottom<00:03:06.959> of

coming in through through the bottom of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:07.970 
coming in through through the bottom of
the<00:03:07.110> enclosure<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.770> through<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the enclosure and then up through the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.680 
the enclosure and then up through the
top<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.250> wouldn't<00:03:08.520> recommend<00:03:08.700> running<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.510> on

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
top I wouldn't recommend running this on

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.690 
top I wouldn't recommend running this on
a<00:03:09.720> soft<00:03:10.080> surface<00:03:10.380> such<00:03:10.770> as<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.130> on<00:03:11.310> your<00:03:11.520> bed

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
a soft surface such as like on your bed

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.300 
a soft surface such as like on your bed
next<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.570> your<00:03:12.720> laptop<00:03:12.900> although<00:03:13.560> usually

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
next to your laptop although usually

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.370 
next to your laptop although usually
that<00:03:14.760> probably<00:03:15.300> wouldn't<00:03:15.570> come<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.350> I

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
that probably wouldn't come up but I

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.810 
that probably wouldn't come up but I
would<00:03:16.620> recommend<00:03:17.100> putting<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.370> down<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.760> a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
would recommend putting you down on a

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.750 
would recommend putting you down on a
hard<00:03:18.150> surface<00:03:18.360> okay<00:03:19.020> at<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.920> back<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.190> over

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
hard surface okay at the back of over

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
indicator LED there hiding probably

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.860 
indicator LED there hiding probably
can't<00:03:23.790> even<00:03:23.850> see<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.450> camera<00:03:24.480> don't

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
can't even see that on the camera don't

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.370 
can't even see that on the camera don't
worry<00:03:24.989> about<00:03:25.050> it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
worry about it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.750 
worry about it
on<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.800> back<00:03:25.950> you've<00:03:26.160> got<00:03:26.190> your<00:03:26.430> power<00:03:26.580> in

your Kensington lock because this baby
is<00:03:28.440> valuable<00:03:28.980> you're<00:03:29.100> gonna<00:03:29.190> want<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.370> lock

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
is valuable you're gonna want to lock

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.760 
is valuable you're gonna want to lock
that<00:03:29.700> up<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:30.030> you're<00:03:30.180> using<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.810> public

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.900 

there's<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.860> store<00:03:35.070> demo<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:35.580> know

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
there's a store demo you know know

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.850 
there's a store demo you know know
there's<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.209> valid<00:03:36.360> reason<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
there's a valid reason for this to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.380 
there's a valid reason for this to
Thunderbolt<00:03:38.400> ports<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:38.880> these<00:03:39.060> are<00:03:39.209> pass

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
Thunderbolt ports so these are pass

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.270 
Thunderbolt ports so these are pass
throughs<00:03:39.780> which<00:03:40.230> means<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.890> daisy<00:03:41.160> chain

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
throughs which means you can daisy chain

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.920 
throughs which means you can daisy chain
up<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:42.420> six<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.680> these<00:03:44.400> which<00:03:45.239> would<00:03:45.420> be<00:03:45.630> just

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
up to six of these which would be just

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.650 
up to six of these which would be just
Oh<00:03:46.280> way<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.340> ballin<00:03:47.910> out<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.450> would<00:03:48.540> be

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
Oh way to ballin out so that would be

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.949 
Oh way to ballin out so that would be
six<00:03:49.050> times<00:03:49.770> two<00:03:50.100> terabytes<00:03:50.780> potentially<00:03:51.780> with

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
to ten gigabit per section but you know

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.770 
to ten gigabit per section but you know
I<00:03:56.400> wonder<00:03:56.670> if<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.820> could<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.120> something<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.690> you

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
I wonder if I could do something to you

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.979 
I wonder if I could do something to you
to<00:03:57.840> send<00:03:58.050> me<00:03:58.140> ten<00:03:58.380> an<00:03:58.530> hour<00:03:58.590> six<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.980> these

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
to send me ten an hour six of these

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.810 
to send me ten an hour six of these
probably<00:04:00.989> not<00:04:01.140> okay<00:04:01.500> let's<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.430> look<00:04:02.459> at

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
probably not okay let's have a look at

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.760 
probably not okay let's have a look at
the<00:04:03.120> drives<00:04:03.420> inside<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.110> I'm<00:04:04.170> expecting<00:04:04.440> needs

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
the drives inside so I'm expecting needs

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.920 
the drives inside so I'm expecting needs
to<00:04:04.860> be<00:04:04.950> regular<00:04:05.510> Velociraptor<00:04:06.510> drives<00:04:06.720> seem

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to be regular Velociraptor drives seem

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.230 
to be regular Velociraptor drives seem
able<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.170> look<00:04:07.290> at<00:04:07.440> though<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.890> will

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
able to look at though that will

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.880 
able to look at though that will
open<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:08.990> this<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> two-and-a-half-inch

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
open it so this is a two-and-a-half-inch

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.650 
open it so this is a two-and-a-half-inch
drive<00:04:10.550> however<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:11.060> is<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.270> thicker

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
drive however it is a thicker

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.440 
drive however it is a thicker
form-factor<00:04:12.260> drive<00:04:12.710> and<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.910> comes<00:04:14.150> with<00:04:14.300> a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
form-factor drive and it comes with a

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.790 
form-factor drive and it comes with a
huge<00:04:14.900> heatsink<00:04:16.270> that<00:04:17.410> allows<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.650> stay

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
huge heatsink that allows it to stay

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.410 
huge heatsink that allows it to stay
cool<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.770> perform<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.940> know<00:04:23.060> like

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
cool and and and perform you know like

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.900 
cool and and and perform you know like
it's<00:04:23.750> 10,000<00:04:24.470> revolutions<00:04:24.770> per<00:04:25.310> minute<00:04:25.520> that

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
it's 10,000 revolutions per minute that

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.270 
it's 10,000 revolutions per minute that
it<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.450> does<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:27.920> we<00:04:27.980> go

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
it that it does and here we go

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.240 
it that it does and here we go
hey<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.480> only<00:04:29.750> use<00:04:30.080> WD<00:04:30.560> blossom<00:04:30.860> after<00:04:30.980> rajma

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
hey so only use WD blossom after rajma

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.830 
hey so only use WD blossom after rajma
the<00:04:31.640> other<00:04:31.790> one<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.090> those<00:04:32.180> labeled<00:04:32.480> only<00:04:32.720> use

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
the other one of those labeled only use

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.570 
the other one of those labeled only use
green<00:04:33.110> drives<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.500> don't<00:04:33.650> know<00:04:33.860> if<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:34.250> for

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
green drives I don't know if this is for

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.550 
green drives I don't know if this is for
more<00:04:34.760> locked<00:04:35.000> or<00:04:35.210> anything<00:04:35.390> like<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.720> but

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
more locked or anything like that but

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.440 
more locked or anything like that but
it's<00:04:36.740> clearly<00:04:37.340> nothing<00:04:37.670> to<00:04:37.940> do<00:04:38.090> with<00:04:38.270> the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
it's clearly nothing to do with the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.360 
it's clearly nothing to do with the
actual<00:04:38.750> cooling<00:04:39.320> capacity<00:04:39.920> of<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.100> unit

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
actual cooling capacity of the unit

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.310 
actual cooling capacity of the unit
because<00:04:40.520> they've<00:04:40.820> taken<00:04:41.030> their<00:04:41.330> lowest<00:04:41.750> power

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.900 

coolest<00:04:45.320> running<00:04:45.650> drives<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:46.190> their<00:04:46.520> highest

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
coolest running drives and their highest

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.430 
coolest running drives and their highest
power<00:04:47.120> hottest<00:04:47.600> running<00:04:47.870> drives<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:48.350> they

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
power hottest running drives and they

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.740 
power hottest running drives and they
put<00:04:48.710> them<00:04:48.860> both<00:04:48.980> in<00:04:49.160> this<00:04:49.340> enclosure<00:04:49.670> so<00:04:50.060> maybe

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
put them both in this enclosure so maybe

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.470 
put them both in this enclosure so maybe
I'm<00:04:50.900> overthinking<00:04:51.140> this<00:04:51.560> but<00:04:51.770> yes<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:53.450> just

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
I'm overthinking this but yes it just

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.820 
I'm overthinking this but yes it just

has this handy-dandy pull tab and other

has this handy-dandy pull tab and other
than<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.190> it<00:04:58.340> looks<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.640> same<00:04:58.910> as<00:04:59.270> our

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900
