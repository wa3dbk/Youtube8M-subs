here in western Washington usually if

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.450 
here in western Washington usually if
you<00:01:06.049> do<00:01:06.229> see<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:06.500> in<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.650> field<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.010> usually

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
you do see it in a field it usually

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.610 
you do see it in a field it usually
stays<00:01:07.790> lower<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.390> ground<00:01:08.500> doesn't<00:01:09.500> get

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
stays lower to the ground doesn't get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.360 
stays lower to the ground doesn't get
quite<00:01:09.860> as<00:01:10.010> large<00:01:10.540> so<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.500> common<00:01:13.160> a

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
quite as large so it is a common a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.730 
quite as large so it is a common a
common<00:01:14.150> plant<00:01:14.480> that<00:01:14.750> grows<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.200> around<00:01:15.230> it

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
common plant that grows all around it

it here on video see if I can looks like

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.880 
it here on video see if I can looks like
we<00:01:33.830> got<00:01:33.860> five<00:01:34.310> petals<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.570> within<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.710> you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
we got five petals and within that you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.000 
we got five petals and within that you
have<00:01:37.130> lots<00:01:37.820> more<00:01:37.970> flowers<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:38.840> those<00:01:39.770> will<00:01:39.890> all

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
have lots more flowers so those will all

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.080 
have lots more flowers so those will all
be<00:01:40.190> seeds<00:01:40.580> so<00:01:40.880> look<00:01:41.180> at<00:01:41.300> all<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:41.570> those<00:01:43.090> flowers

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
be seeds so look at all of those flowers

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.660 
be seeds so look at all of those flowers
in<00:01:44.390> there<00:01:44.810> all<00:01:45.020> these<00:01:45.560> little<00:01:45.770> center<00:01:46.190> areas

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
in there all these little center areas

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.970 
in there all these little center areas
are<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> bunch<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.240> little<00:01:47.420> flowers<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:48.740> these

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
are a bunch of little flowers with these

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.730 
are a bunch of little flowers with these
ray<00:01:49.310> disc<00:01:49.700> flowers<00:01:50.390> around<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> edges<00:01:50.960> making

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
ray disc flowers around the edges making

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.830 
ray disc flowers around the edges making
up<00:01:51.980> this<00:01:52.130> cluster<00:01:53.980> identifying<00:01:54.980> flowers

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
up this cluster identifying flowers

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.090 
up this cluster identifying flowers
plants<00:01:56.840> by<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:56.990> flowers<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.590> how<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.770> field

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
plants by the flowers is how the field

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.450 
plants by the flowers is how the field
guides<00:01:58.340> organize<00:01:58.850> themselves<00:01:59.060> and<00:02:00.220> then<00:02:01.220> this

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
guides organize themselves and then this

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.399 
guides organize themselves and then this
is<00:02:01.640> alternate<00:02:02.240> branching<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.050> don't<00:02:03.200> have

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
is alternate branching so you don't have

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.040 
is alternate branching so you don't have
the<00:02:03.620> leaves<00:02:03.830> coming<00:02:04.220> out<00:02:04.340> side<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.820> side<00:02:05.050> and

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
the leaves coming out side to side and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.240 
the leaves coming out side to side and
all<00:02:06.650> those<00:02:06.920> little<00:02:07.220> leaflets<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.069> it's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
all those little leaflets you know it's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.649 
all those little leaflets you know it's
yarrow<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.700> know<00:02:10.909> you<00:02:11.209> just<00:02:11.359> put<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> little

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
yarrow I know you just put a little

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.879 
yarrow I know you just put a little
piece<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.019> your<00:02:12.049> mouth<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.499> you'll<00:02:12.620> know<00:02:12.739> it's
