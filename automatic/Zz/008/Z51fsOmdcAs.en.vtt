sorry<00:06:28.330> that<00:06:28.510> the<00:06:28.690> lighting<00:06:28.930> is<00:06:29.050> all<00:06:29.170> kind<00:06:29.410> of

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
sorry that the lighting is all kind of

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.820 
sorry that the lighting is all kind of
retarded<00:06:30.100> but<00:06:30.880> this<00:06:31.390> is<00:06:31.540> pretty<00:06:31.720> much<00:06:31.840> what<00:06:32.710> it

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
retarded but this is pretty much what it

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.380 
retarded but this is pretty much what it
looks<00:06:33.100> like<00:06:34.980> just<00:06:35.980> basically<00:06:36.340> backtrack<00:06:37.000> to

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
looks like just basically backtrack to

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.780 
looks like just basically backtrack to
the<00:06:37.720> video<00:06:38.040> that<00:06:39.040> I<00:06:39.070> did<00:06:39.280> with<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.460> blushes

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
the video that I did with the blushes

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.710 
the video that I did with the blushes
because<00:06:39.880> the<00:06:40.030> lighting<00:06:40.270> in<00:06:40.330> there<00:06:40.480> is<00:06:40.540> better

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
because the lighting in there is better

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.690 
because the lighting in there is better
but<00:06:41.290> this<00:06:41.410> is<00:06:41.470> basically<00:06:41.860> just<00:06:42.100> how<00:06:42.190> I<00:06:42.220> did<00:06:42.550> it

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
but this is basically just how I did it

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.030 
but this is basically just how I did it
so<00:06:43.150> if<00:06:43.420> you<00:06:43.510> guys<00:06:43.630> want<00:06:44.470> a<00:06:44.530> better<00:06:44.710> look<00:06:44.890> of
