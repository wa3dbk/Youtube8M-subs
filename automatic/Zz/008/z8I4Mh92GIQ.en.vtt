00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
like I said earlier I do not like to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.800 
like I said earlier I do not like to
wire<00:01:32.729> much<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.780> these<00:01:34.050> are<00:01:34.500> modeled<00:01:35.250> power

I<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.360> these<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:42.720> eBay<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.979> operate

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
I got these from eBay and these operate

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.889 
I got these from eBay and these operate
at<00:01:44.580> 12<00:01:44.849> to<00:01:45.060> 16<00:01:45.420> volts

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
at 12 to 16 volts

at 12 to 16 volts
sometimes<00:01:46.679> with<00:01:46.830> lighting<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.310> need

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
sometimes with lighting you need

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.100 
sometimes with lighting you need
resistors<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.240> these<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.599> not<00:01:48.630> require

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
resistors but these do not require

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.900 
resistors but these do not require
resistors<00:01:49.679> because<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.130> operate<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.580> 12<00:01:50.789> to

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
resistors because they operate at 12 to

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
to so the peel and stick lights are real

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.120 
to so the peel and stick lights are real
simple<00:02:00.660> they're<00:02:00.989> just<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.319> light<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.920> has<00:02:02.099> a

simple they're just a light that has a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.680 
simple they're just a light that has a
little<00:02:02.250> nice<00:02:02.459> little<00:02:02.489> double-sided<00:02:03.270> tape<00:02:03.509> on

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
little nice little double-sided tape on

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.630 
little nice little double-sided tape on
here<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.110> remove<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> backing<00:02:04.709> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here that you remove the backing the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.070 
here that you remove the backing the
other<00:02:05.789> side<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.090> already<00:02:06.300> stuck<00:02:06.539> obviously

other side is already stuck obviously

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.690 
other side is already stuck obviously
and<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> stick<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.709> wherever<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and you stick it wherever you want it

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.809 
and you stick it wherever you want it
inside<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.720> structure<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:11.220> the

inside of a structure and then the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.479 
inside of a structure and then the
wiring<00:02:12.030> part<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> pretty<00:02:12.780> simple<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.290> well<00:02:13.489> so

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
wiring part is pretty simple as well so

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.660 
wiring part is pretty simple as well so
I'm<00:02:14.640> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.819> lay<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.150> down<00:02:15.209> here

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.280 

there<00:02:19.270> I've<00:02:19.420> got<00:02:19.560> what's<00:02:20.560> called<00:02:20.880> Atlas<00:02:22.290> model

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
there I've got what's called Atlas model

stranded<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.280> definitely<00:02:27.640> want<00:02:27.790> stranded<00:02:28.270> if

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
stranded you definitely want stranded if

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.890 
stranded you definitely want stranded if
you're<00:02:28.510> doing<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:28.930> sound<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:31.209> lights<00:02:31.690> I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you're doing with sound and lights I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.410 
you're doing with sound and lights I
prefer<00:02:32.290> stranded<00:02:32.830> because<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:33.160> just<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.459> kind

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
prefer stranded because it's just a kind

prefer stranded because it's just a kind
of<00:02:34.569> conducts<00:02:34.989> better<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.970> take<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.390> you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
of conducts better so you take this you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.460 
of conducts better so you take this you
simply<00:02:39.180> cut<00:02:40.180> off<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.510> end<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.200> wire

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
simply cut off the end with a wire

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.630 
simply cut off the end with a wire
stripper<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.890> you're<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> wire

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
stripper so you're just going to wire

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.470 
stripper so you're just going to wire
strip<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> edge<00:02:46.300> here<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:48.370> I'm<00:02:49.120> not<00:02:49.269> going<00:02:49.420> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
strip the edge here and I'm not going to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.059 
strip the edge here and I'm not going to
do<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.599> to<00:02:49.810> save<00:02:49.989> time<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.590> get<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.860> point

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
do it to save time but you get the point

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.479 
do it to save time but you get the point
you<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.670> basically<00:02:52.060> expose<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> wire<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
you you basically expose the wire and

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.699 
you you basically expose the wire and
you're<00:02:54.489> going<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.670> attach<00:02:54.940> one<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:58.260> each<00:02:59.260> side

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
you're going to attach one to each side

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.289 
you're going to attach one to each side
and<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.280> make<00:03:00.730> sure<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.120> have<00:03:01.299> your<00:03:01.750> sides

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
and just make sure you have your sides

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.699 
and just make sure you have your sides
separated<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.569> don't<00:03:04.750> want<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.019> run<00:03:05.319> this<00:03:05.530> to

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
separated you don't want to run this to

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.509 
separated you don't want to run this to
one<00:03:05.890> single<00:03:06.280> wire<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.049> got<00:03:08.410> one<00:03:08.620> side<00:03:08.890> and

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
one single wire so you got one side and

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.640 
one single wire so you got one side and
you<00:03:10.090> hook<00:03:10.269> another<00:03:10.540> wire<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> other<00:03:11.350> side

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
you hook another wire to the other side

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.539 
you hook another wire to the other side
and<00:03:12.040> you're<00:03:12.640> good<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.790> go<00:03:12.910> now<00:03:14.250> I'll<00:03:15.250> literally

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
and you're good to go now I'll literally

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.090 
and you're good to go now I'll literally
show<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.060> how<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:16.959> did<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.440> lot<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.799> people

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
show you how I did this a lot of people

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.650 
show you how I did this a lot of people
are<00:03:18.190> not<00:03:18.310> fans<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.790> my<00:03:18.910> wiring<00:03:19.180> because<00:03:19.630> I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
are not fans of my wiring because I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.330 
are not fans of my wiring because I
don't<00:03:19.930> do<00:03:20.110> things<00:03:20.350> like<00:03:20.470> heat<00:03:20.739> shrink<00:03:20.980> tubing

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
don't do things like heat shrink tubing

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.009 
don't do things like heat shrink tubing
and<00:03:21.489> things<00:03:21.670> like<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.030> well<00:03:22.630> let's<00:03:22.780> go<00:03:22.900> ahead

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
and things like that well let's go ahead

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.479 
and things like that well let's go ahead
and<00:03:23.200> pick<00:03:23.320> up<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.620> church<00:03:23.859> and<00:03:24.100> take<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> look

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
and pick up this church and take a look

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.490 
and pick up this church and take a look
at<00:03:24.579> what<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.730> did<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.540> under<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:25.989> church<00:03:26.260> we

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
at what I did so under this church we

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.490 
at what I did so under this church we
have<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.030> actually<00:03:28.030> two<00:03:28.239> lights<00:03:28.510> placed<00:03:28.870> so

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
have the actually two lights placed so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.650 
have the actually two lights placed so

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
told you about these DC power packs you

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.759 
told you about these DC power packs you
can<00:03:52.030> pick<00:03:52.329> up<00:03:52.359> they're<00:03:53.049> pretty<00:03:53.290> simple

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
can pick up they're pretty simple

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.160 
can pick up they're pretty simple
you<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:54.910> hook<00:03:55.030> up<00:03:55.180> like<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.840> said<00:03:56.019> you're

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
you just hook up like I said you're

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.660 
you just hook up like I said you're
keeping<00:03:56.470> your<00:03:56.560> side<00:03:56.769> separate<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.430> want

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
keeping your side separate so you want

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.599 
keeping your side separate so you want
one<00:03:57.880> side<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.329> each<00:03:58.570> one<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.220> you<00:04:00.220> want<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.430> go

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
one side on each one and you want to go

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.789 
one side on each one and you want to go
ahead<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.910> just<00:04:01.030> hook<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.299> up<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:02.650> may

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
ahead and just hook it up and you may

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.199 
ahead and just hook it up and you may
want<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.069> check<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.430> output<00:04:03.579> voltage

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
want to check the output voltage

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.090 
want to check the output voltage
beforehand<00:04:04.810> because<00:04:04.900> like<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.530> said<00:04:05.590> these

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
beforehand because like I said these

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.610 
beforehand because like I said these
operate<00:04:07.090> at<00:04:07.239> twelve<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.690> sixteen<00:04:07.959> volts<00:04:08.290> so

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
operate at twelve to sixteen volts so

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.530 
operate at twelve to sixteen volts so
you<00:04:08.709> don't<00:04:08.950> want<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.250> blow<00:04:09.819> your<00:04:10.030> lights<00:04:10.239> by

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
you don't want to blow your lights by

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.479 
you don't want to blow your lights by
giving<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:10.959> too<00:04:11.109> many<00:04:11.290> volts<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:12.310> these

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
giving it too many volts but these

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.490 
giving it too many volts but these
usually<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:12.970> max<00:04:13.359> volt<00:04:13.690> like<00:04:14.109> this<00:04:14.290> one's

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
usually have a max volt like this one's

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.479 
usually have a max volt like this one's
nineteen<00:04:14.889> point<00:04:15.190> two<00:04:15.250> volts<00:04:16.109> max<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.470> it's<00:04:18.400> not

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
nineteen point two volts max so it's not

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.129 
nineteen point two volts max so it's not
going<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.760> go<00:04:18.850> any<00:04:18.970> higher<00:04:19.060> than<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.660> but<00:04:19.989> you

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
going to go any higher than that but you

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.680 
going to go any higher than that but you
want<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.320> make<00:04:20.500> sure<00:04:20.530> you're<00:04:20.799> not<00:04:20.889> over<00:04:21.690> giving

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
want to make sure you're not over giving

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.629 
want to make sure you're not over giving
the<00:04:22.960> lights<00:04:23.350> too<00:04:23.590> much<00:04:23.740> juice<00:04:24.100> because<00:04:24.340> you

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
the lights too much juice because you

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.850 
the lights too much juice because you
will<00:04:24.820> blow<00:04:25.030> them<00:04:25.240> eventually<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.530> can

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
will blow them eventually so you can

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.040 
will blow them eventually so you can
take<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.010> multimeter<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:28.060> check<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.900> output

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
take a multimeter to it check the output

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.839 
take a multimeter to it check the output
leave<00:04:30.229> it<00:04:30.379> in<00:04:30.530> or<00:04:31.039> sometimes<00:04:31.460> people<00:04:31.550> even

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
leave it in or sometimes people even

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.249 
leave it in or sometimes people even
superglue<00:04:32.539> this<00:04:32.750> down

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
superglue this down

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.629 
superglue this down
they<00:04:33.740> don't<00:04:33.919> want<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.099> use<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.340> for<00:04:34.370> anything

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
they don't want to use it for anything

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.600 
they don't want to use it for anything
else<00:04:35.900> they'll<00:04:36.349> super<00:04:36.949> glue<00:04:37.159> it<00:04:37.250> or<00:04:37.370> tape<00:04:37.580> it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
else they'll super glue it or tape it

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.760 
else they'll super glue it or tape it
down<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.330> setting<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.930> then<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.620> have

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
down to that setting and then you have

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.309 
down to that setting and then you have
your<00:04:39.889> voltage<00:04:40.310> set<00:04:40.639> all<00:04:41.569> right<00:04:41.629> so<00:04:41.960> now<00:04:42.110> let's

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
your voltage set all right so now let's

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.589 
your voltage set all right so now let's
talk<00:04:42.470> about<00:04:42.530> church<00:04:42.979> sounds<00:04:43.490> as<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:44.210> guys<00:04:44.360> see

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
talk about church sounds as you guys see

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.930 
talk about church sounds as you guys see
here<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.080> have<00:04:45.289> this<00:04:45.440> little<00:04:45.620> button<00:04:46.009> that<00:04:46.310> I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
here I have this little button that I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.580 
here I have this little button that I
push<00:04:46.970> with<00:04:47.449> a<00:04:47.479> little<00:04:47.780> label<00:04:47.900> this<00:04:48.169> is<00:04:48.229> church

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590

sounds and when I hit the button it will
play<00:04:51.349> the<00:04:51.530> true<00:04:51.710> sounds<00:04:52.129> but<00:04:52.310> before<00:04:52.699> I<00:04:52.729> show

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
play the true sounds but before I show

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.240 
play the true sounds but before I show
you<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.330> want<00:04:53.539> to<00:04:53.629> show<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:54.250> product

do this very simply okay so we are under

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.860 
do this very simply okay so we are under
my<00:05:00.770> layout<00:05:01.159> and<00:05:01.699> I<00:05:02.240> was<00:05:02.330> debating<00:05:02.449> on<00:05:02.750> whether

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
my layout and I was debating on whether

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.659 
my layout and I was debating on whether
to<00:05:03.050> show<00:05:03.199> you<00:05:03.259> guys<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.710> diagram<00:05:04.250> or<00:05:04.490> just

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
to show you guys the diagram or just

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.760 
to show you guys the diagram or just
show<00:05:04.819> you<00:05:04.879> the<00:05:05.060> actual<00:05:05.330> chip<00:05:05.659> but<00:05:06.469> I<00:05:06.500> can't

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
show you the actual chip but I can't

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.219 
show you the actual chip but I can't
find<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.099> diagram<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.849> I<00:05:08.270> guess<00:05:08.629> my<00:05:08.780> mind<00:05:08.990> was

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
find the diagram so I guess my mind was

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.980 
find the diagram so I guess my mind was
made<00:05:09.349> up<00:05:09.409> for<00:05:09.770> me<00:05:09.889> this<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.639> an<00:05:10.759> ITT<00:05:11.479> products

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.189 
which I just bought a power pack through
them<00:05:43.039> the<00:05:43.639> only<00:05:43.909> mistake<00:05:44.240> I<00:05:44.419> made<00:05:44.449> was<00:05:44.870> way

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
them the only mistake I made was way

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.510 
them the only mistake I made was way
down<00:05:45.469> here<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.139> got<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.380> big<00:05:48.740> speaker<00:05:49.069> a<00:05:49.219> four

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
down here so I got a big speaker a four

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.540 
down here so I got a big speaker a four
inch<00:05:49.669> speaker<00:05:49.909> and<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.180> didn't<00:05:50.389> really<00:05:50.569> think

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
inch speaker and I didn't really think

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.360 
inch speaker and I didn't really think
how<00:05:52.550> big<00:05:52.789> it<00:05:52.969> actually<00:05:53.180> was<00:05:53.630> so<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.349> decided<00:05:55.190> to

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
how big it actually was so I decided to

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.240 
how big it actually was so I decided to
I<00:05:55.940> had<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.210> make<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.620> makeshift<00:05:57.620> speaker<00:05:58.009> box

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
I had to make a makeshift speaker box

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.709 
I had to make a makeshift speaker box
for<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.580> which<00:05:58.699> is<00:05:58.819> just<00:05:58.849> out<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.120> cardboard<00:05:59.659> to

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
for it which is just out of cardboard to

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.019 
for it which is just out of cardboard to
give<00:05:59.900> it<00:06:00.020> more<00:06:00.169> base<00:06:00.379> and<00:06:01.219> it's<00:06:01.370> way<00:06:01.580> down<00:06:01.789> here

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
give it more base and it's way down here

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.920 
give it more base and it's way down here
but<00:06:03.759> overall<00:06:04.759> you<00:06:05.240> know<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.360> just<00:06:05.569> had<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.779> make

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
but overall you know I just had to make

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.010 
but overall you know I just had to make
a<00:06:05.990> makeshift<00:06:06.770> speaker<00:06:07.479> box<00:06:08.479> because<00:06:08.930> the

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
a makeshift speaker box because the

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.360 
a makeshift speaker box because the
speaker<00:06:09.319> was<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:09.560> large<00:06:09.770> if<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.129> want<00:06:10.310> a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
speaker was so large if you want a

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.860 
speaker was so large if you want a
smaller<00:06:10.699> speaker<00:06:11.120> that<00:06:11.240> you<00:06:11.300> can<00:06:11.419> put<00:06:11.690> into

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
smaller speaker that you can put into

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.809 
smaller speaker that you can put into
the<00:06:11.960> bench<00:06:12.199> worki<00:06:12.560> or<00:06:12.710> layout<00:06:13.099> I<00:06:13.129> suggest<00:06:13.639> that

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
the bench worki or layout I suggest that

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.670 
the bench worki or layout I suggest that
but<00:06:14.539> that's<00:06:14.719> how<00:06:14.870> that's<00:06:15.020> done<00:06:15.259> it's<00:06:15.469> real

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
but that's how that's done it's real
