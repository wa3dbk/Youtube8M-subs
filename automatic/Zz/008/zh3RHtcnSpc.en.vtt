part<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.710> giant<00:01:38.100> conspiracy<00:01:38.400> there's<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
part of a giant conspiracy there's a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
part of a giant conspiracy there's a
plot<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> use<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> children<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> fuel<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
plot to use the children to fuel this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.429 
plot to use the children to fuel this
giant<00:01:41.579> machine<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.390> suck<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> life<00:01:43.170> out

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
giant machine that can suck the life out

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.590 
giant machine that can suck the life out
of<00:01:43.470> them<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.130> least<00:01:44.159> turn<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.759> white<00:01:45.329> or

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
of them or at least turn them white or

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.880 
of them or at least turn them white or
something<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.259> sure<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
something I'm not really sure what it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
something I'm not really sure what it
does<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.310> apparently<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.299> makes<00:01:48.659> even<00:01:48.930> more

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
does but apparently it makes even more

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.859 
does but apparently it makes even more
energy<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.210> sure<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
energy and I'm not really sure if it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.990 
energy and I'm not really sure if it
kills<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.220> even<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.850> it's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
kills them or what or even what it's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.649 
kills them or what or even what it's
doing<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.560> sounds<00:01:56.009> evil<00:01:56.310> yeah<00:01:57.240> okay

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
doing but no it sounds evil yeah okay

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
doing but no it sounds evil yeah okay
the<00:01:57.780> evil<00:01:58.049> plan<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.590> movie<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> little

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the evil plan in this movie is a little

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
the evil plan in this movie is a little
complicated<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.030> honestly<00:02:00.420> even<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.899> could

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
complicated and honestly even I could

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.389 
complicated and honestly even I could
barely<00:02:01.259> follow<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.040> unfortunately

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
barely follow it and unfortunately

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.639 
barely follow it and unfortunately
that's<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.540> film's<00:02:03.899> only<00:02:04.079> shortcoming

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that's not the film's only shortcoming

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.770 
that's not the film's only shortcoming

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
for you to sleep while I think of a plan

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.050 
for you to sleep while I think of a plan
I<00:02:29.320> could<00:02:30.320> see<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.620> Patton<00:02:31.010> Oswald<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.910> this

I could see like a Patton Oswald in this
role<00:02:32.390> or<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> Jack<00:02:33.080> Black<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:34.010> there's<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> lot

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
villains I mean the designs are kind of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.250 
villains I mean the designs are kind of
fun<00:02:54.830> but<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.220> characters<00:02:55.730> are<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.360> bland<00:02:56.870> and

really really have fun with it the plot

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.440 
really really have fun with it the plot
like<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.770> said<00:03:10.010> while<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> good<00:03:10.520> set<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:11.090> gets<00:03:11.330> a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
like I said while a good set up gets a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.600 
like I said while a good set up gets a
little<00:03:11.780> too<00:03:12.080> complicated<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:13.040> think<00:03:13.070> even<00:03:13.459> for

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
little too complicated I think even for

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.490 
little too complicated I think even for
kids<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.120> follow<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.720> mean<00:03:14.989> they<00:03:15.170> can<00:03:15.350> get

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
kids to follow I mean they can get

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.650 
kids to follow I mean they can get
through<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.890> okay<00:03:15.980> but<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.030> specifics<00:03:17.540> are

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the movie is sort of a mixed bag there's

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.470 
the movie is sort of a mixed bag there's
some<00:04:34.980> stuff<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.430> really<00:04:35.610> like<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:35.940> lot<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.300> stuff

some stuff I really like a lot of stuff

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.030 
some stuff I really like a lot of stuff
I<00:04:36.630> don't<00:04:36.690> like<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.440> it's<00:04:37.560> hard<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.740> think<00:04:37.890> of

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
I don't like but it's hard to think of

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.250 
I don't like but it's hard to think of
anything<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.430> really<00:04:38.790> hate<00:04:39.450> some<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.200> the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
anything I really hate some of the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.170 
anything I really hate some of the
monsters<00:04:40.740> are<00:04:40.890> creative<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.790> be<00:04:41.910> fair<00:04:42.120> I

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
monsters are creative but to be fair I

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.310 
monsters are creative but to be fair I
think<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.510> could<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:42.720> been<00:04:42.810> more<00:04:43.020> creative

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
think that could have been more creative

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.440 
think that could have been more creative
on<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> designs<00:04:44.160> but<00:04:44.490> they<00:04:44.850> make<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.030> with<00:04:45.330> it

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450
