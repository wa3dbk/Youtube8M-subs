00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
go to how to make an origami crane this

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.530 
go to how to make an origami crane this
is<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:21.710> could<00:04:22.710> not<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:23.130> played<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.790> that's<00:04:24.300> one

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
another video this is a video that had

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.100 
another video this is a video that had

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
transferred from one of the max so

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.730 
transferred from one of the max so
videos<00:04:43.980> do<00:04:44.310> play<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:46.080> one<00:04:46.230> I<00:04:46.260> happen<00:04:46.710> to

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
videos do play just the one I happen to

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.580 
videos do play just the one I happen to
transfer<00:04:47.310> was<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.690> Apple<00:04:49.050> format<00:04:49.470> if

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
transfer was in the Apple format if

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.860 
transfer was in the Apple format if
therefore<00:04:49.940> would<00:04:50.940> not<00:04:50.970> work<00:04:51.330> now<00:04:51.480> I'm<00:04:51.570> Sugar's

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
therefore would not work now I'm Sugar's

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.390 
therefore would not work now I'm Sugar's
app<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.230> can<00:04:52.350> download<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:52.890> will<00:04:53.070> let<00:04:53.250> you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
app you can download that will let you

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.700 
app you can download that will let you
convert<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.060> file<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.350> would<00:04:55.500> work

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
convert the file so that it would work

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.530 
convert the file so that it would work
but<00:04:55.980> just<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.520> was<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:56.820> more<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.450> to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
but just this was this more of just to

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.350 
but just this was this more of just to
show<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.980> how<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.040> transfer<00:04:59.580> your<00:04:59.730> files<00:04:59.940> and

show you how to transfer your files and
then<00:05:00.450> where<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.780> find<00:05:01.050> them<00:05:01.290> afterward<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:02.850> I

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
then where to find them afterward so I

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.200 
then where to find them afterward so I
