and strike two vortex vortex high-tech

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.420 
and strike two vortex vortex high-tech
technology<00:00:17.869> from<00:00:18.869> nerve<00:00:19.260> there's<00:00:19.800> different

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

technology from nerve there's different
companies<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.300> dart<00:00:21.630> tag<00:00:22.340> vortex<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
companies like dart tag vortex and and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.209 
companies like dart tag vortex and and
strike<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:27.109> some<00:00:28.109> other<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.830> might<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
strike and some other you might know and

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.200 
strike and some other you might know and
it<00:00:32.219> also<00:00:32.430> says<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.270> alright<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:35.059> we're<00:00:36.059> going

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it also says here alright so we're going

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
it also says here alright so we're going
to<00:00:36.329> compare<00:00:38.840> vortex<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.460> stroke<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to compare vortex and and stroke but I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
to compare vortex and and stroke but I
don't<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:45.480> guns<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:47.329> hmm<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:48.590> don't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
don't have two guns because hmm i don't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.180 
don't have two guns because hmm i don't
have<00:00:49.920> enough<00:00:50.160> money<00:00:50.399> ok<00:00:52.280> don't<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.789> unstruck

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
have enough money ok don't the unstruck

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.639 
have enough money ok don't the unstruck
so<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.850> start<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:59.030> it's<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.149> very

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
so they you start so it's actually very

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.200 
so they you start so it's actually very
safer<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.989> doesn't<00:01:04.350> hurt<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:06.890> so

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
safer and it doesn't hurt that much so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:21.760 
safer and it doesn't hurt that much so
is<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.240> what<00:01:09.780> some<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> strike<00:01:12.630> guns<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
is it what some and strike guns use and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.569 
is it what some and strike guns use and
vortex<00:01:24.350> uses<00:01:26.150> these<00:01:27.470> which<00:01:28.470> gives<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.189> more

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
vortex uses these which gives a more

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.450 
vortex uses these which gives a more
hurt<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.240> hard<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
hurt you can actually get hard so I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.300 
hurt you can actually get hard so I
actually<00:01:35.729> kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.560> goes

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
actually kind of like it because it goes

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.740 
actually kind of like it because it goes
on<00:01:38.490> high<00:01:38.790> ranges<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.920> shot<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
on high ranges and you just get shot and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
on high ranges and you just get shot and
this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> frisbee<00:01:43.759> nerf<00:01:44.759> thing<00:01:45.149> looks

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this is what a frisbee nerf thing looks

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:55.160 
this is what a frisbee nerf thing looks
like<00:01:48.799> get<00:01:49.799> hit<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:53.180> they<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:54.420> different

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
like get hit and they are very different

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.880 
like get hit and they are very different
as<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.560> trued

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.490 
guns have like a hole in them but these
don't<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:13.739> end<00:04:14.040> strike<00:04:14.639> has<00:04:14.970> two<00:04:15.720> semi

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
don't and the end strike has two semi

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.750 
don't and the end strike has two semi
auto<00:04:16.889> guns<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:19.260> think<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.039> night<00:04:20.250> one<00:04:20.549> is

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
auto guns and I think the night one is

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.760 
auto guns and I think the night one is
semi<00:04:21.090> auto<00:04:21.389> not<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.469> sure<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.250> might

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.270 

and<00:04:27.660> one<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:30.699> clips<00:04:31.030> can<00:04:31.389> only<00:04:31.919> fit<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:33.099> in

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
and one the clips can only fit it in

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:50.119 
and one the clips can only fit it in
everything<00:04:39.479> can<00:04:40.479> see<00:04:40.900> have<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> recon<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.639> clip

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.869 

be<00:04:51.180> compatible<00:04:53.129> and<00:04:54.180> yeah<00:04:56.370> vortexes<00:04:57.370> green

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
be compatible and yeah vortexes green

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.770 
be compatible and yeah vortexes green
and<00:04:58.330> some<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.620> unstruck<00:05:00.340> guns<00:05:01.090> are<00:05:01.330> green

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
and some of the unstruck guns are green

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.230 
and some of the unstruck guns are green
and<00:05:03.810> yeah<00:05:04.979> some<00:05:05.979> go<00:05:06.430> on<00:05:06.580> very<00:05:07.060> long<00:05:07.419> ranges

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
and yeah some go on very long ranges

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.180 
and yeah some go on very long ranges
some<00:05:10.240> can<00:05:10.509> be<00:05:10.690> clicked<00:05:11.349> and<00:05:12.009> I<00:05:13.409> just<00:05:14.409> think<00:05:14.740> and

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
some can be clicked and I just think and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.320 
some can be clicked and I just think and
strike<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.240> little<00:05:16.750> cooler<00:05:17.080> but<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.009> one

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
strike is a little cooler but the one

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330 
strike is a little cooler but the one
the<00:05:19.330> thing<00:05:19.630> i<00:05:19.870> don't<00:05:19.930> like<00:05:20.199> about<00:05:20.349> and<00:05:20.860> strike

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340

if<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.849> they<00:05:22.360> can<00:05:22.599> be<00:05:22.780> cutted<00:05:23.169> easily<00:05:23.710> with

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
if that they can be cutted easily with

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.360
