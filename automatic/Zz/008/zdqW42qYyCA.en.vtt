00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.789
 I was vulnerable just like you 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.830
 uncertain he is afraid of death 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.820
 then everything has changed just before 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 by twelve hours 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:29.990
 I do not know I'm a begging them 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.730
 Bissel we have a packet with something 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.469
 very special in their too 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.420
 and they will transport it for us 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.520
 she wants to rejoice the rules and it will 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.360
 nobody hurt 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.360
 I am not in the mood 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.040
 It says we only use ten people 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:54.000
 percent of our cerebral skills 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.680
 but what if there is a way out 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.860
 to one hundred percent of our brain too 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.120
 gain 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.120
 what would we be capable of 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.679
 Professor Norman I have yours 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.149
 research interests 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.140
 human brain read there is one 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.909
 few gaps in what I am on the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 right track 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.270
 Thank you I am capable of doing you 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.369
 had never done before 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.750
 I feel everything and I can do that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.399
 Control elements around me 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.579
 We must be strong 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.579
 believe me 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 The chemical allows her new areale 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.920
 unlock your brain 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.119
 she has skills 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.400
 it must not fall into the wrong hands 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:51.920
 should we go until no movement 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.690
 please put the hands up, we 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.810
 include capacity grows with everyone 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.810
 minute 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.960
 what happens when you get the 100 percent 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.960
 reached 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.680
 I have no idea 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 she is the key to everything 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.720
 I drive 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.720
 no, this is a police car 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.470
 do not understand me you understand 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.870
 only if you send me to the hospital now 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.870
 dead someone has pressure on me
