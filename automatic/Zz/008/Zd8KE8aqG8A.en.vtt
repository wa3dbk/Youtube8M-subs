00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
for through neck are fairly obvious you

you have the central piece that runs all
the<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.420> through<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> wing<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the body of the guitar and you can see

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.399 
the body of the guitar and you can see
that<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> back<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.930> perhaps<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that on the back there perhaps not on

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.149 
that on the back there perhaps not on
video<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:29.940> Schecter<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
video and what Schecter have done is it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.030 
video and what Schecter have done is it
appears<00:01:32.369> they've<00:01:32.610> used<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.150> solid<00:01:34.049> laminate

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
appears they've used one solid laminate

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
appears they've used one solid laminate
of<00:01:35.190> Carina<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.030> front<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> does<00:01:36.750> give

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
of Carina on the front and it does give

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
of Carina on the front and it does give
the<00:01:37.200> impression<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.549> guitar<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.909> Hulme

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the impression that the guitar is Hulme

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.050 
the impression that the guitar is Hulme
from<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> solid<00:01:40.290> piece<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.500> Carina<00:01:41.040> again<00:01:41.880> it's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
from a solid piece of Carina again it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.030 
from a solid piece of Carina again it's
purely<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.420> cosmetic<00:01:43.020> thing<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> nice

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
purely a cosmetic thing but it is a nice

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
purely a cosmetic thing but it is a nice
one<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:46.500> neck<00:01:46.710> itself<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:48.030> quite

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
one the neck itself is actually quite

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.460 
one the neck itself is actually quite
chunky<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.549> guitar<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.780> certainly<00:01:52.290> not

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
chunky on this guitar it's certainly not

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
chunky on this guitar it's certainly not
a<00:01:52.530> skinny<00:01:52.920> speed<00:01:53.340> neck<00:01:53.610> though<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.150> have

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a skinny speed neck though it does have

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
a skinny speed neck though it does have
a<00:01:54.750> rather<00:01:55.080> pleasing<00:01:55.470> flat<00:01:55.979> back<00:01:56.310> section

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
a rather pleasing flat back section

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.060 
a rather pleasing flat back section
which<00:01:57.570> means<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.020> actually<00:01:58.290> remarkably

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
which means it's actually remarkably

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
which means it's actually remarkably
comfortable<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.820> playing<00:02:00.090> thumb<00:02:00.450> behind<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
comfortable on playing thumb behind and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
this is a snap open cover so you don't

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.170 
this is a snap open cover so you don't
have<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.109> go<00:04:20.260> diving<00:04:21.010> few<00:04:21.310> screwdrivers

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
have to go diving few screwdrivers

time you forgot and changed the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.159 
time you forgot and changed the
batteries<00:04:23.889> on<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.180> whole<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.539> construction

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169

on<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.320> guitar<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.740> fantastic<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.820> feels<00:04:28.660> more

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
on the guitar is fantastic it feels more

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.260 
on the guitar is fantastic it feels more
expensive<00:04:30.100> than<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.340> actually<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.789> and<00:04:31.180> is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
expensive than it actually is and is

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.240 
expensive than it actually is and is
surprisingly<00:04:31.960> comfortable<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.979> use

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
surprisingly comfortable to use

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.820 
surprisingly comfortable to use
considering<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.449> a<00:04:34.479> V<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.320> does<00:04:35.590> have

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
considering it is a V and it does have

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.870 
considering it is a V and it does have
quite<00:04:36.039> a<00:04:36.130> large<00:04:36.430> neck<00:04:37.289> so<00:04:38.289> that's<00:04:39.039> the<00:04:39.340> spec

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
quite a large neck so that's the spec

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.400 
quite a large neck so that's the spec
and<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.240> hardware<00:04:40.600> covered<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.139> think<00:04:41.320> it's

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
and the hardware covered I think it's

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.779 
and the hardware covered I think it's
time<00:04:41.530> we<00:04:41.590> took<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.919> listen<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.460> some<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.699> the

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
time we took a listen to some of the

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.029 
time we took a listen to some of the
sounds<00:04:43.210> here<00:04:43.389> so<00:04:44.199> let's<00:04:44.380> start<00:04:44.680> off<00:04:44.770> with<00:04:44.830> the

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
sounds here so let's start off with the

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.740 
sounds here so let's start off with the
clean<00:04:45.340> sounds<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.270> get<00:04:46.449> from<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
clean sounds that you get from the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:06:30.900 
clean sounds that you get from the
Schecter<00:04:47.110> v7

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.180 

and<00:06:31.910> now<00:06:32.270> let's<00:06:32.660> move<00:06:33.050> on<00:06:33.260> to<00:06:33.470> some<00:06:33.680> over

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
and now let's move on to some over

00:06:34.190 --> 00:07:44.850 
and now let's move on to some over
driven<00:06:34.550> and<00:06:34.700> dirty<00:06:35.180> sounds

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.470

something that looks with a nod to the

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.520 
something that looks with a nod to the
past<00:08:03.890> but<00:08:04.490> is<00:08:04.610> definitely<00:08:05.210> very<00:08:05.240> modern<00:08:05.780> you

past but is definitely very modern you

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.650 
past but is definitely very modern you
could<00:08:06.680> do<00:08:06.830> far<00:08:07.130> worse<00:08:07.190> and<00:08:08.060> get<00:08:08.210> yourself<00:08:08.540> on

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:08.660 
could do far worse and get yourself on

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.470 
could do far worse and get yourself on
one<00:08:08.810> of<00:08:08.840> these<00:08:08.960> V<00:08:09.200> sevens<00:08:10.030> okay<00:08:11.030> that<00:08:11.270> brings

one of these V sevens okay that brings

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.670 
one of these V sevens okay that brings
us<00:08:11.600> to<00:08:11.720> the<00:08:11.810> end<00:08:11.840> of<00:08:12.020> the<00:08:12.080> review<00:08:12.350> I<00:08:12.380> hope
