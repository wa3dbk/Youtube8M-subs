00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.730 
out of the tanker to come in right here
and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.600> those<00:01:54.810> will<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.079> my<00:01:55.229> three<00:01:55.409> lines

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and then those will be my three lines

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
and then those will be my three lines
this<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> first<00:01:56.969> line<00:01:57.590> second<00:01:58.590> line

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
this will be the first line second line

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190 
this will be the first line second line
and<00:01:59.189> third<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.030> sit<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.390> level<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> way

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and third you sit this level that way

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
and third you sit this level that way
it's<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.710> read<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.250> three<00:02:02.729> lines

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it's just you read it to all three lines

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.149 
it's just you read it to all three lines
evenly<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:04.649> our<00:02:04.680> here's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> little

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
evenly that's when our here's a little

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.859 
evenly that's when our here's a little
bit<00:02:05.250> higher<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.460> it'll<00:02:05.939> never<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.360> flow<00:02:06.600> plus

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
bit higher so it'll never back flow plus

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.749 
bit higher so it'll never back flow plus
you<00:02:07.049> got<00:02:07.229> fall<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.149> house

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
you got fall from the house

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.309 
you got fall from the house
I<00:02:10.019> made<00:02:11.019> about<00:02:11.110> 160<00:02:11.890> foot<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:12.250> PVC<00:02:12.879> pipe<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
I made about 160 foot of PVC pipe the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.479 
I made about 160 foot of PVC pipe the
first<00:02:14.590> line<00:02:14.829> comes<00:02:15.189> all<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.489> way<00:02:15.519> down<00:02:15.579> here

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
first line comes all the way down here

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.289 
first line comes all the way down here
starts<00:02:18.489> right<00:02:18.730> there<00:02:18.939> and<00:02:19.239> just<00:02:20.079> kind<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.409> at<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
starts right there and just kind of at a

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.530 
starts right there and just kind of at a
45<00:02:22.299> degree<00:02:22.329> angle<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.790> got<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:25.000> be<00:02:25.090> at<00:02:25.150> least<00:02:25.209> 9

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
45 degree angle you got to be at least 9

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.780 
45 degree angle you got to be at least 9
foot<00:02:25.780> apart<00:02:26.079> so<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.349> think<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.739> did<00:02:26.920> him<00:02:27.010> 10<00:02:27.250> or<00:02:27.370> 11

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
foot apart so I think I did him 10 or 11

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.539 
foot apart so I think I did him 10 or 11
so<00:02:28.060> whatever<00:02:28.450> worked<00:02:28.690> out<00:02:28.950> I'll<00:02:29.950> recheck<00:02:30.370> it

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
so whatever worked out I'll recheck it

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.800 
so whatever worked out I'll recheck it
before<00:02:30.819> they<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:33.030> well<00:02:34.030> that's<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.360> start<00:02:34.629> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
before they get well that's the start of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.589 
before they get well that's the start of
it<00:02:35.670> wait<00:02:36.670> till<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:36.879> day<00:02:37.030> when<00:02:37.239> we<00:02:37.299> won't<00:02:37.420> have<00:02:37.540> a

where these ends are ever got to be
pumped<00:03:07.329> out<00:03:07.389> if<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.900> will<00:03:08.049> never<00:03:08.230> have<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:08.349> be

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
pumped out if it will never have to be

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.089 
pumped out if it will never have to be
pumped<00:03:08.709> out<00:03:08.889> but<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.790> will<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.620> I'm<00:03:11.799> gonna<00:03:11.980> go

pumped out but it will so I'm gonna go

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.789 
pumped out but it will so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.780> upload<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:14.049> off<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.410> trailer

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
ahead and upload this off the trailer

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.849 
ahead and upload this off the trailer
and<00:03:14.829> get<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.810> stacked<00:03:16.810> up<00:03:17.049> he<00:03:17.290> said<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.620> stack

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
and get it stacked up he said just stack

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.460 
and get it stacked up he said just stack
it<00:03:17.889> up<00:03:18.040> inside<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.639> trailer<00:03:18.849> that<00:03:19.030> way<00:03:19.470> good

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
it up inside the trailer that way good

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.800 
it up inside the trailer that way good
guess<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.859> wind<00:03:21.069> come<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.489> won't<00:03:21.579> go<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.000> blow

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
guess the wind come it won't go and blow

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.620 
guess the wind come it won't go and blow
it<00:03:22.989> all<00:03:23.079> over<00:03:23.349> the<00:03:23.440> place
