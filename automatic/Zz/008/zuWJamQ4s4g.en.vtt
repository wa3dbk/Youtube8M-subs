00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.810> think<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.140> started<00:00:01.530> going<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.770> be

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I think I think I started going to be

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.470 
I think I think I started going to be
frustrated<00:00:02.460> with<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:02.669> guy<00:00:02.879> essential

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
frustrated with this guy essential

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.800 
frustrated with this guy essential
central<00:00:04.259> image<00:00:05.120> that<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.150> was<00:00:06.330> getting<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.629> lot

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
central image that I was getting a lot

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.759 
central image that I was getting a lot
and<00:00:07.220> so<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.929> started<00:00:09.929> thinking<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.530> I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and so I started thinking about how I

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
and so I started thinking about how I
could<00:00:12.920> instead<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.099> formally<00:00:14.610> composing<00:00:15.179> an

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
could instead of formally composing an

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.800 
could instead of formally composing an
image<00:00:15.949> if<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.130> could<00:00:17.190> set<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.180> procedure<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
image if I could set up a procedure of

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.290 
image if I could set up a procedure of
jewelry<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.470> will<00:00:19.890> create<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:21.150> would

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
jewelry that will create that would

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.750 
jewelry that will create that would
create<00:00:21.449> its<00:00:21.750> own<00:00:21.869> composition<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.730> I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
create its own composition so what I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460 
create its own composition so what I
mean<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.570> certain<00:00:24.930> rules<00:00:25.109> where

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
mean is I with have certain rules where

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250 
mean is I with have certain rules where
I'll<00:00:25.949> cross<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.820> trust<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.720> will

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I'll cross it here trust there will

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.720 
I'll cross it here trust there will
always<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> other<00:00:29.849> side<00:00:30.380> and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
always be going to the other side and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
always be going to the other side and
trying<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.910> form<00:00:33.210> images<00:00:33.690> within<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
trying to form images within my just a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.549 
trying to form images within my just a
set<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.149> logical<00:00:36.899> procedure<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
set of logical procedure and then I

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
set of logical procedure and then I
moved<00:00:40.559> from<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:42.020> something<00:00:43.020> else

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
moved from that because something else

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.770 
moved from that because something else
interesting<00:00:43.350> start<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> happen<00:00:44.780> which

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
interesting start to happen which

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
interesting start to happen which
probably<00:00:46.110> informs<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.489> work<00:00:47.640> left

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
probably informs all the work left

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.720 
probably informs all the work left
really<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> thing<00:00:49.500> where<00:00:49.770> these

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
really this kind of thing where these

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.490 
really this kind of thing where these
lines<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.570> formed<00:00:51.840> stars<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:53.180> and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
lines that have formed stars here and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.209 
lines that have formed stars here and
behind<00:00:56.390> which<00:00:57.469> seemed<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> me<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.829> you've

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
behind which seemed to me like you've

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
behind which seemed to me like you've
got<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.460> big<00:00:59.730> line<00:01:00.030> above<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.289> star

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
got this big line above and in this star

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.100 
got this big line above and in this star
in<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> background<00:01:02.280> you're<00:01:02.430> always<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
in the background you're always kind of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.130 
in the background you're always kind of
seeing<00:01:04.110> these<00:01:04.379> black<00:01:05.250> lines<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.510> I'll

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
seeing these black lines and I'll

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.570 
seeing these black lines and I'll
starting<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:07.710> about<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> cliche

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
starting to think about that cliche

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
starting to think about that cliche
gospel<00:01:09.000> well<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.869> staying<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gospel well think about like staying the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
gospel well think about like staying the
critical<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> stars<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.360> of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
critical if it stars and that kind of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
critical if it stars and that kind of
played<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.200> mind<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.590> lot<00:01:13.619> i'm<00:01:13.950> still

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
played on my mind a lot i'm still

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.510 
played on my mind a lot i'm still
available<00:01:14.729> Barton<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.930> able<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.920> be

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
available Barton would be able to be be

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
available Barton would be able to be be
here<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.390> gutters<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.049> look<00:01:19.229> through

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
here with these gutters but look through

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.120 
here with these gutters but look through
these<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> stop<00:01:20.430> stop<00:01:21.299> forms<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
these kind of stop stop forms and so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.810 
these kind of stop stop forms and so
then<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.759> started<00:01:24.750> focusing<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:26.070> these<00:01:26.369> star

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
then I started focusing on these star

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.069 
then I started focusing on these star
forms<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.750> make<00:01:27.990> compositions<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.750> these<00:01:30.750> are

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
forms to make compositions so these are

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.340 
forms to make compositions so these are
all<00:01:31.110> made<00:01:31.530> based<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.490> start<00:01:32.880> forms<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
all made based on start forms and the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.210 
all made based on start forms and the
same<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.450> originally<00:01:39.860> as<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:41.070> as

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
same that this was originally as much as

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.400 
same that this was originally as much as
the<00:01:41.340> star<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.509> then

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
the star and then

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.590 
the star and then
looking<00:01:46.410> through<00:01:46.640> through<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.910> but<00:01:48.450> then

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
looking through through that but then

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.990 
looking through through that but then
again<00:01:50.450> maybe<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:51.900> of<00:01:52.340> fell<00:01:53.340> into<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.760> idea

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
again maybe kind of fell into this idea

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.840 
again maybe kind of fell into this idea
of<00:01:54.420> having<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:55.110> formal<00:01:56.100> foreground<00:01:56.550> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
of having a formal foreground and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.800 
of having a formal foreground and
background<00:01:56.910> by<00:01:57.600> putting<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.110> forms<00:01:58.470> here

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
background by putting these forms here

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.110 
background by putting these forms here
well<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:01.080> what<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> gave<00:02:01.650> me<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.120> it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
well think what this gave me was it

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.000 
well think what this gave me was it
started<00:02:04.020> again<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.440> interesting

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
started again that interesting

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.860 
started again that interesting
perspective<00:02:05.610> about<00:02:05.760> be<00:02:06.180> able<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.510> look<00:02:06.660> up<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
perspective about be able to look up to

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.080 
perspective about be able to look up to
something<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.670> an<00:02:08.790> interesting

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
something and that was an interesting

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.060 
something and that was an interesting
that's<00:02:09.330> kind<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.660> followed<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.890> also

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
that's kind of followed up and also

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.340 
that's kind of followed up and also
interested<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.690> cuttings<00:02:13.110> we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
interested it's like your cuttings we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.100 
interested it's like your cuttings we
provide<00:02:13.560> solid<00:02:14.270> having<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.360> form<00:02:15.660> that's<00:02:15.840> quite

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
provide solid having a form that's quite

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.040 
provide solid having a form that's quite
solid<00:02:16.560> d<00:02:17.040> else<00:02:17.220> interested<00:02:17.760> he's<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> fan<00:02:19.020> of

solid d else interested he's a fan of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.650 
solid d else interested he's a fan of
own<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.520> time<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.150> thought<00:02:21.360> about

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
own the first time that I thought about

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.710 
own the first time that I thought about
this<00:02:21.990> idea<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.500> canopy<00:02:23.240> again<00:02:24.240> because

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
this idea of a canopy again because

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.040 
this idea of a canopy again because
thinking<00:02:25.620> about<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.700> physical<00:02:27.540> canopy<00:02:27.960> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
thinking about a physical canopy and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.840 
thinking about a physical canopy and
also<00:02:28.290> things<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.560> can't<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.100> stars<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
also things that can't be the stars and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.090 
also things that can't be the stars and
again<00:02:30.510> plate<00:02:30.870> these<00:02:31.110> thinking<00:02:31.620> about<00:02:31.830> words

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
again plate these thinking about words

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.300 
again plate these thinking about words
and<00:02:32.840> being<00:02:33.840> able<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.860> something<00:02:35.040> quite

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and being able to get something quite

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.800 
and being able to get something quite
physical<00:02:36.170> fighting<00:02:37.170> quite<00:02:37.650> object<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.810> but

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
physical fighting quite object like but

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.020 
physical fighting quite object like but
being<00:02:40.020> able<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.440> through<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.760> pretty<00:02:41.760> much

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
being able to see through it pretty much

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.420 
being able to see through it pretty much
the<00:02:42.300> same<00:02:42.480> as<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.870> room<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.650> beyoncé's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the same as this room but beyoncé's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.450 
the same as this room but beyoncé's
against<00:02:45.300> get<00:02:46.050> something<00:02:46.080> quite<00:02:46.470> physical<00:02:47.010> but

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460

the sky and be able to contain something

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.690 
the sky and be able to contain something
quite<00:02:54.360> physical<00:02:54.900> which<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.580> what<00:02:56.580> I'm

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
quite physical which is what I'm

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.180 
quite physical which is what I'm
interested<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.240> really<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:59.010> like

you the ephemeral of this idea that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360 
you the ephemeral of this idea that
that's<00:03:01.230> why<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.470> was<00:03:01.500> useful<00:03:01.770> these<00:03:02.040> gutters

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
that's why it was useful these gutters

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.920 
that's why it was useful these gutters
and<00:03:02.550> stars<00:03:02.790> thing<00:03:03.030> interested<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.720> love

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
kind of floaty and that's okay and I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.380 
kind of floaty and that's okay and I
wanted<00:03:22.950> better<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.610> wanted<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.209> somehow

combination freakin if you can hold that
FEM<00:03:30.600> reality<00:03:31.080> into<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.770> question<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.670> think

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
FEM reality into the question I think

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.370 
FEM reality into the question I think
the<00:03:33.090> thing<00:03:33.120> was<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.660> was<00:03:33.780> getting<00:03:33.900> involved<00:03:34.170> in

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
the thing was I was getting involved in

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.130 
the thing was I was getting involved in
formal<00:03:34.709> things<00:03:35.239> but<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.690> has<00:03:36.959> to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
formal things but I think that has to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.110 
formal things but I think that has to
have<00:03:37.320> more<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.860> you're<00:03:38.010> going<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.580> it

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
have more if you're going to do that it

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.729 
have more if you're going to do that it
has<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.390> go<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:39.690> way<00:03:39.870> they're<00:03:40.110> very<00:03:40.380> has<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
has to go one way they're very has to

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.670 
has to go one way they're very has to
have<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> kind<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.400> mathematical<00:03:41.940> rigor<00:03:42.630> or<00:03:42.989> it

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
have a kind of mathematical rigor or it

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.400 
have a kind of mathematical rigor or it
or<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.430> has<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.820> something<00:03:45.000> else<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.540> felt<00:03:46.290> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
or it has to be something else I felt I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.400 
or it has to be something else I felt I
was<00:03:46.560> falling<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:47.220> between<00:03:48.060> two<00:03:48.510> stalls<00:03:48.870> with

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
was falling in between two stalls with

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.860 
was falling in between two stalls with
some<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.040> also<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.820> felt<00:03:51.470> will<00:03:52.470> get

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
some of it and also I felt will get

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.809 
some of it and also I felt will get
made<00:03:53.049> in<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.290> minute<00:03:53.560> but<00:03:53.709> i<00:03:53.739> felt<00:03:54.099> like<00:03:54.159> i<00:03:54.519> was

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
made in a minute but i felt like i was

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.820 
made in a minute but i felt like i was
playing<00:03:55.090> formal<00:03:55.659> games<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.470> could<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.709> gone

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.680 
playing formal games you could have gone
on<00:03:56.920> forever<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:57.519> i<00:03:57.730> didn't<00:03:58.239> really<00:03:58.360> feel<00:03:58.480> like

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
on forever and i didn't really feel like

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.860 
on forever and i didn't really feel like
that<00:03:59.379> was<00:03:59.590> getting<00:03:59.890> anywhere<00:04:00.330> with<00:04:01.330> both<00:04:01.840> of

them really off so even though the word
is<00:04:04.269> sitting<00:04:04.629> on<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.870> top<00:04:05.110> i<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:06.549> i<00:04:06.819> was<00:04:07.120> almost

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
is sitting on the top i was i was almost

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.110 
is sitting on the top i was i was almost
seeing<00:04:07.930> those<00:04:08.230> kind<00:04:09.069> of<00:04:09.159> i<00:04:09.370> was<00:04:09.610> playing<00:04:09.879> hot

seeing those kind of i was playing hot
okay<00:04:10.720> no<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.409> thinking<00:04:12.040> about<00:04:12.220> architecture<00:04:12.909> as

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
okay no I thinking about architecture as

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.379 
okay no I thinking about architecture as
indeed<00:04:13.690> structures<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:15.370> again<00:04:15.970> thinking

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
indeed structures but again thinking

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.939 
indeed structures but again thinking
about<00:04:16.660> them<00:04:16.870> being<00:04:17.079> structures<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.739> could

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
about them being structures you could

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.599 
about them being structures you could
see<00:04:18.130> through<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:19.299> seeing<00:04:19.780> semen<00:04:20.650> was<00:04:20.769> yes<00:04:21.250> as

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
see through so seeing semen was yes as

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.060 
see through so seeing semen was yes as
forms<00:04:22.060> but<00:04:22.240> also<00:04:22.389> as<00:04:22.630> windows<00:04:23.020> so<00:04:23.919> as

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
forms but also as windows so as

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.330 
forms but also as windows so as
buildings<00:04:24.490> but<00:04:24.610> also<00:04:24.699> as<00:04:25.000> windows<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:26.340> like

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
buildings but also as windows and like

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.090 
buildings but also as windows and like
portholes<00:04:27.910> for<00:04:28.210> something<00:04:28.539> I'm<00:04:29.070> dealing<00:04:30.070> with

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
portholes for something I'm dealing with

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.779 
portholes for something I'm dealing with
them<00:04:31.560> yeah<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.770> mean<00:04:32.830> may<00:04:33.100> try<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.430> make

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
them yeah I mean may try to make

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.980 
them yeah I mean may try to make
something<00:04:33.970> very<00:04:34.090> physical<00:04:35.010> that<00:04:36.010> also<00:04:36.220> has

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
something very physical that also has

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.590 
something very physical that also has
has<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.500> faraway<00:04:39.370> look<00:04:39.699> as<00:04:39.910> well<00:04:40.060> so<00:04:40.419> although

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
has a faraway look as well so although

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.330 
has a faraway look as well so although
it's<00:04:40.870> going<00:04:41.110> towards<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.740> also<00:04:42.070> looking

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
it's going towards you you also looking

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.639 
it's going towards you you also looking
through
