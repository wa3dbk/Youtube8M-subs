 Poker game rules For more information, see the ★ mark website 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 I will pass one by one and make it 5 per person. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Make sure that only you can see, and keep the same numbers. This time we are going face up for explanation 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:47.000
・ Take the number of cards you don't need as you can for the role.・ For the role, refer to the ★★ mark homepage for the explanation minutes ・ As there is “1 ・ 1” as the person under this time, discard 3 sheets and aim at 1 or a joker. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Since the other party has "flash", it can not be won by three cards next, so it aims at "Fourcard or Full House". 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 The other party wins * If there are more than one, the rest will finish after one week 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 2nd game 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 As there are two "K" as a lower person, I aim at "Three card" 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 The opponent is the last in the "straight" line, and the third card of [K] is aligned, but the lower person loses because "straight" is more useful. For detailed rules, please refer to the ★ mark homepage of the explanation. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 3rd game 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:43.066
 There are two [k] as a lower person, but I thought a little because the other party abandoned one K ^ ^; ※ I will not see the other party's hand, but I will be able to see the discarded card . 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I will aim straight with leaving "8 9 10". Because "8, 9, 10, 12," came out, I aim at "11" or "Joker". 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Since the other party has "three cards", it will be the last in the next. If it is "straight", it wins usefully, but I tried to put it all in order to explain the rules ^ ^; ※ You can discard all the cards and take! For more information, see ★ Mark Website
