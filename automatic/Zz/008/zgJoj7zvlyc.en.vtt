00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.900 

changing<00:00:04.630> the<00:00:04.720> square<00:00:05.080> into<00:00:05.830> an<00:00:06.069> octagon<00:00:06.640> is

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
changing the square into an octagon is

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.510 
changing the square into an octagon is
easy<00:00:07.270> once<00:00:07.569> you<00:00:07.689> understand<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:09.160> geometry

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.520 
easy once you understand the geometry

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.660 
easy once you understand the geometry
the<00:00:10.480> first<00:00:10.750> thing<00:00:11.019> to<00:00:11.170> do<00:00:11.350> is<00:00:11.920> we<00:00:12.279> have<00:00:12.459> our

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
the first thing to do is we have our

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.519 
the first thing to do is we have our
square<00:00:12.910> leg<00:00:13.270> here<00:00:13.600> at<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:13.809> top<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.910> have<00:00:16.529> found

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
square leg here at the top we have found

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.770 
square leg here at the top we have found
the<00:00:17.650> center<00:00:17.949> point<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.550> so<00:00:19.270> we<00:00:19.300> set<00:00:20.400> compasses

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
the center point and so we set compasses

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.330 
the center point and so we set compasses
to<00:00:22.780> the<00:00:23.440> radius<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:25.770> you<00:00:26.770> scribe<00:00:27.250> an<00:00:27.610> arc

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
to the radius and then you scribe an arc

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.200 
to the radius and then you scribe an arc
from<00:00:30.340> that<00:00:30.580> corner

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
from that corner

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.600 
from that corner
move<00:00:31.780> to<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.140> next<00:00:32.410> corner<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.860> do<00:00:33.219> the<00:00:33.370> same

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
move to the next corner and do the same

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:43.420 
move to the next corner and do the same
thing

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.970 

so<00:00:44.000> these<00:00:44.150> two<00:00:44.450> points<00:00:45.310> become<00:00:46.310> one<00:00:47.030> facet

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
so these two points become one facet

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.180 
so these two points become one facet
these<00:00:48.980> two<00:00:49.250> points<00:00:49.670> become<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.060> facet<00:00:51.190> these

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
these two points become a facet these

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.360 
these two points become a facet these
points<00:00:52.670> become<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:53.000> facet<00:00:53.830> these<00:00:54.830> points

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
points become a facet these points

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.970 
points become a facet these points
become<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.030> facet

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.940 

this<00:01:00.520> leg<00:01:00.820> is<00:01:01.090> an<00:01:01.239> inch<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.540> 5/8<00:01:02.200> inch<00:01:02.470> square

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
this leg is an inch and 5/8 inch square

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.130 
this leg is an inch and 5/8 inch square
and<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.700> tapers<00:01:03.910> from<00:01:04.659> an<00:01:04.780> inch<00:01:04.960> and

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
and it tapers from an inch and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.520 
and it tapers from an inch and
five-eighths<00:01:05.560> down<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.250> an<00:01:06.370> inch<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:08.290> just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
five-eighths down to an inch so we just

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.010 
five-eighths down to an inch so we just
set<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.010> combination<00:01:09.850> square<00:01:10.210> four<00:01:10.479> or<00:01:10.659> five

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
set the combination square four or five

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.460 
set the combination square four or five
sixteenths<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.640> will<00:01:15.909> give<00:01:16.150> us<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
sixteenths and that will give us in the

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.609 
sixteenths and that will give us in the
end

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.039 

the<00:01:23.130> inch<00:01:23.750> square<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.619> need<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:27.060> turn

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the inch square that we need to turn

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.859 
the inch square that we need to turn
into<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.619> octagon<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> once<00:01:30.390> again<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.840> have

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
into an octagon so once again we have

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.230 
into an octagon so once again we have
the<00:01:31.500> center<00:01:31.799> point<00:01:32.420> marked<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.729> then<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.939> set

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the center point marked and then we set

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.390 
the center point marked and then we set
the<00:01:36.950> compass<00:01:37.950> scribe

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.840 

the<00:01:42.940> radius<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.940> excellence<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
the radius out to the excellence of the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.800 
the radius out to the excellence of the
square

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.170 

the<00:01:57.350> next<00:01:57.650> step<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.490> taper<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.900> leg<00:02:00.110> blank

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
the next step is to taper the leg blank

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.060 
the next step is to taper the leg blank
not<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.450> an<00:02:02.540> octagon<00:02:03.080> but<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.619> tapered

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
not to an octagon but to a tapered

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.719 
not to an octagon but to a tapered
square<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.950> first<00:02:07.190> thing<00:02:07.369> I'm<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.549> to

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
square so the first thing I'm going to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.190 
square so the first thing I'm going to
do<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.319> Mark<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.530> taper<00:02:09.950> on<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:10.700> face<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.750> cut

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
do is Mark the taper on one face and cut

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.080 
do is Mark the taper on one face and cut
that<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.920> can<00:02:13.160> cut<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.580> either<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
that you can cut that either on the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.400 
that you can cut that either on the
bandsaw<00:02:15.160> or<00:02:16.160> using<00:02:16.910> playing<00:02:17.300> or<00:02:17.750> whatever<00:02:18.260> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
bandsaw or using playing or whatever you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.809 
bandsaw or using playing or whatever you
have<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:20.900> am<00:02:21.020> marking<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.770> taper<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.430> this

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
have here I am marking the taper on this

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.420 
have here I am marking the taper on this
face<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.959> wooden<00:02:24.140> straight<00:02:24.470> edge<00:02:24.709> so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
face with the wooden straight edge so

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.650 
face with the wooden straight edge so
you<00:02:25.459> go<00:02:25.700> from<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.400> excellence<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.300> small

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
you go from the excellence of that small

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.340 
you go from the excellence of that small
octagon<00:02:31.060> up<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.510> corner<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:36.080> do<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
octagon up to the corner and then do the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.750 
octagon up to the corner and then do the
same<00:02:36.560> thing<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:39.200> other<00:02:39.230> edge<00:02:39.650> now<00:02:40.610> I've

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
same thing on the other edge now I've

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.559 
same thing on the other edge now I've
tapered<00:02:41.350> two<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> faces<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
tapered two of the faces so I'm going to

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.840 
tapered two of the faces so I'm going to
taper<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.019> other<00:02:45.170> two<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.890> we'll<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.459> four

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
taper the other two so we'll have a four

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.530 
taper the other two so we'll have a four
sided<00:02:47.150> tape<00:02:47.569> or<00:02:47.780> leg<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.860> taper

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
sided tape or leg and then we can taper

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.740 
sided tape or leg and then we can taper
the<00:02:53.540> four<00:02:53.780> sided<00:02:54.050> leg<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.890> an<00:02:55.220> eight<00:02:55.459> sided

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the four sided leg into an eight sided

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.830 
the four sided leg into an eight sided
tapered<00:02:56.750> octagon<00:02:57.470> now<00:02:58.069> with<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> taper

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
tapered octagon now with the taper

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.270 
tapered octagon now with the taper
established<00:02:59.840> on<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.110> four<00:03:00.380> edges<00:03:00.500> it's<00:03:01.010> just

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
established on all four edges it's just

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.670 
established on all four edges it's just
a<00:03:01.430> matter<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:02.680> setting<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.959> eight<00:03:06.350> sided

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
a matter of setting the eight sided

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.880 
a matter of setting the eight sided
octagon<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:11.079> marking<00:03:12.280> those<00:03:13.280> facets<00:03:14.890> all

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
octagon and marking those facets all

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:30.240 
octagon and marking those facets all
around

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.220 

with<00:03:31.250> all<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.520> layout<00:03:31.820> lines<00:03:32.510> drawn<00:03:32.990> it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
with all the layout lines drawn it's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.750 
with all the layout lines drawn it's
just<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.470> matter<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.770> cleaning<00:03:34.220> down<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.610> them

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
just a matter of cleaning down to them
