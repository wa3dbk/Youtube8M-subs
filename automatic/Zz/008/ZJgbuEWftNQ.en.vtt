00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you see it actually got a little bit

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
you see it actually got a little bit
pink<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.350> during<00:01:31.680> shipping<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
pink out of it during shipping it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.980 
pink out of it during shipping it
doesn't<00:01:33.030> seem<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.420> made<00:01:33.750> any<00:01:33.930> difference

at<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.790> pilot<00:01:36.030> saying

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
at all all right so this is pilot saying

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
at all all right so this is pilot saying
this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> blue<00:01:36.750> black<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.100> see

this is blue black and as you can see

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
this is blue black and as you can see
here<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:39.229> good<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> focus<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.770> bit

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
here it's good to focus a little bit

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.730 
here it's good to focus a little bit
better<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:42.479> does<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.020> shading<00:01:43.590> which

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
better this does have some shading which
