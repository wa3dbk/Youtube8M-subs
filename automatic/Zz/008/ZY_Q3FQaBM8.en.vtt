00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
it's called deadheading which means you

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.129 
it's called deadheading which means you

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
seed pods from the plant the reason we

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.740 
seed pods from the plant the reason we
do<00:00:12.870> deadheading<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.769> because<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:14.750> flowering

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
do deadheading is because all flowering

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.140 
do deadheading is because all flowering
plants<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.470> supposed<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> produce<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.609> blossom

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
plants are supposed to produce a blossom

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.210 
plants are supposed to produce a blossom
which<00:00:18.630> then<00:00:18.869> turns<00:00:19.109> into<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> seed<00:00:19.740> head<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
which then turns into a seed head and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.490 
which then turns into a seed head and
once<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> puts<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:21.689> its<00:00:21.810> seed<00:00:22.080> head<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
once it puts out its seed head and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.070 
once it puts out its seed head and
recedes<00:00:23.250> itself<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.029> done<00:00:24.269> its<00:00:24.420> job<00:00:24.539> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
recedes itself it has done its job it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.259 
recedes itself it has done its job it
has<00:00:25.199> lived<00:00:25.470> its<00:00:25.650> life<00:00:25.710> expectancy<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
has lived its life expectancy so it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.589 
has lived its life expectancy so it
slows<00:00:27.599> down<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.519> gardeners<00:00:29.880> sometime

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
slows down so we as gardeners sometime

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.810 
slows down so we as gardeners sometime
back<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.170> realized<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.430> cut<00:00:32.790> off

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
back have realized that if we cut off

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 
back have realized that if we cut off
the<00:00:33.270> old<00:00:33.300> blossoms<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.649> cut<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.040> that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the old blossoms and we cut off that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.549 
the old blossoms and we cut off that
seed<00:00:35.579> head<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:36.059> tricking<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> flower<00:00:36.870> into

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
seed head we're tricking the flower into

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and make a cut this is going to promote

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.579 
and make a cut this is going to promote
new<00:00:59.100> growth<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.640> come<00:00:59.820> out<00:01:02.359> as<00:01:03.439> you're<00:01:04.439> going

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

through I'm deadheading you want to make

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
through I'm deadheading you want to make
sure<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> you'd<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> clean<00:01:07.710> cut<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.310> lot

sure that you'd make a clean cut a lot

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.830 
sure that you'd make a clean cut a lot
of<00:01:08.760> people<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:09.689> your

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
of people you know you can use your

pruning<00:01:12.869> device<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.729> helpful<00:01:15.030> in

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pruning device is really helpful in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
pruning device is really helpful in
making<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.630> clean<00:01:15.930> cut<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> don't<00:01:17.040> make

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
making that clean cut if you don't make

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.289 
making that clean cut if you don't make
a<00:01:17.220> clean<00:01:17.610> cut<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:18.439> asking<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.619> disease<00:01:20.299> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
a clean cut you're asking for disease to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.020 
a clean cut you're asking for disease to
enter<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> stem<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.610> when<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.729> dying

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
enter in the stem there when it's dying

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
enter in the stem there when it's dying
off<00:01:27.229> undercutting<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.890> really

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
off undercutting is also really

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.609 
off undercutting is also really
important<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:30.119> only<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.540> dead<00:01:30.810> heading<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
important not only is dead heading but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.130 
important not only is dead heading but
when<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> undercut<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> go

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
when you undercut you you want to go

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
when you undercut you you want to go
from<00:01:34.439> underneath<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.250> start<00:01:35.579> thinning<00:01:36.090> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
from underneath and start thinning that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
from underneath and start thinning that
out<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.259> happens<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> gets

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
out because what happens is it gets

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.749 
out because what happens is it gets
really<00:01:38.189> leggy<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
really leggy so if you go in and you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
really leggy so if you go in and you
kind<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.150> start<00:01:42.420> thinning<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.460> you're

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
kind of just start thinning out you're

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
kind of just start thinning out you're
also<00:01:44.729> promoting<00:01:45.210> more<00:01:45.720> growth<00:01:46.049> by<00:01:46.350> doing<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
also promoting more growth by doing that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.639 
also promoting more growth by doing that
and<00:01:46.950> sometimes<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.700> say<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.090> 25%<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.500> your

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and sometimes they say like 25% of your

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
and sometimes they say like 25% of your
basket<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.430> thinned<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.880> within<00:01:51.479> two<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
basket can be thinned out within two to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.620 
basket can be thinned out within two to
three<00:01:51.899> days<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> reproduce<00:01:53.970> new

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
three days it's going to reproduce new

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.929 
three days it's going to reproduce new
shoots<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:56.070> we've<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.640> beautiful

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
shoots here we've got this beautiful

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.149 
shoots here we've got this beautiful
sweet<00:01:57.479> potato<00:01:57.810> vine<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> grow

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
sweet potato vine and it's going to grow
