00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.069
 of the coordination exercise 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.060
 the exercise is now going to be the sequence 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:17.620
 it's going to be 14 2 3 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:20.480
 average angular wrist then 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.330
 It would be this way 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.250
 keeping remember all are all 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.020
 warned 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.020
 then it would be ningbo 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.370
 4 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.710
 two 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.079

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.740
 4 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.820
 two 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.900
 and that is to do it several times until 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.720
 this 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.030
 it's a little bit of learning improving 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.750
 achieving greater coordination with 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 one 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.250
 4 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.650
 two 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 as an additional comment to the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.710
 previous videos 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.830
 of this same exercise 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.659
 and you will feel value meaning unique 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.590
 that normal with working with 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.740
 your fingers in this sequence will feel 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.080
 the fatigue in this part is normal 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.640
 it means that your hands of you do not 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.890
 they are working properly 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.950
 just take care of no no as a 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 attention here if send feel that you 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.509
 it hurts here that you get tired that you have to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.509
 hurts you here better for the exercise 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.090
 because you should not hold here you should not 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.630
 You can hurt your wrist 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.910
 even then of the entities 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.220
 play totally relaxed and that is not 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.900
 with hand in a strange position with that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.200
 that's going to be that as an extension 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.900
 and it's going to hurt the little ones 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.069
 by way of 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.890
 work very relaxed and does this 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.540
 exercise remembers reaching the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.360
 Muscular exhaustion must be difficult 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.130
