all<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> calculations<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.680> there

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
all the calculations because I was there

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
all the calculations because I was there
with<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.009> crappy<00:01:41.520> piece<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.970> paper<00:01:42.420> sort<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
with this crappy piece of paper sort of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.120 
with this crappy piece of paper sort of
at<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.899> side<00:01:43.170> watching<00:01:43.380> trying<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> work<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
at the side watching trying to work it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
at the side watching trying to work it
all<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.280> never<00:01:45.119> your<00:01:45.329> math<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.509> appalling<00:01:45.960> so

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
all out never your math is appalling so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.120 
all out never your math is appalling so
that<00:01:46.290> doesn't<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.530> count<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that doesn't really count but I to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
that doesn't really count but I to
calculate<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> Stein<00:01:48.090> master<00:01:48.689> justice<00:01:49.049> Souter

and<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.250> added<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> thought

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and I added it all up and so I thought

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
and I added it all up and so I thought
it<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> case<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.579> I'm<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> talk<00:01:54.180> back
