00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 I do not 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
 wake 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.619
 is zelda the best unisex game that is 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.080
 It is the best game for men and women 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.570
 I do not think so and I would need 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.939
 investigate more days about it though 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.619
 It is a strong competitor and I would love it 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.410
 talk about why I think it's the is 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.000
 one of the best games my ex and for 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 that this is not seen only from the point of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.210
 view of a man 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.910
 I also have my point of view in this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.650
 video like this is zelda is one of the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.410
 most popular franchises in the world of 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.300
 the video games and personally one of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.220
 my favorite and if there is something that always 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.720
 it has caught my attention is how I 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.290
 like men and women 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.480
 women 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.519
 some usual with most of the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.019
 Nintendo games has always had the 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.790
 ability to play people from 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.019
 any age or gender is not 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.730
 be surprised that the gamers 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.800
 we like nintendo me in particular 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.690
 start playing video games because my 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.229
 lives taught me to play nintendo 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.700
 donkey kong mario bitch both all 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 these characters have something in 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 particular that can please any 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.539
 person but with zelda something happens in 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.460
 I started playing a special 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.780
 videogames that my dad bought but he 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 it was the first game that my sisters 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 and I longed after the announcements 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.850
 perfectly good advertising 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.950
 managed that allowed something too 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.960
 ethical you have all the elements 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 that can captivate anyone 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.979
 it has been to fiction and action but 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.720
 It also has a visual appeal and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.789
 very detailed musical that is difficult 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.440
 let go unnoticed I will not say 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.220
 what is zelda is the most purchased game 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.860
 by women 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.810
 more oriented to them tell me that it is 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.690
 the best games because a lot of people 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.300
 know through him and get married for his 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.900
 blame and for the case I would talk 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.790
 of second life go not the interesting thing in 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.250
 'cell is that it's a game that both 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.050
 twins we play for different reasons the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.490
 how we interpret the three characters 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.870
 main game won link and zelda 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.150
 since the strong relationship was announced 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.630
 that these three characters have in the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.950
 universe of zelda destined to compete 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.709
 eternally to change the destiny of 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.440
 world in a never ending cycle something reacted 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.720
 in fans has elements of a 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.270
 epic battle between parties that receive 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.610
 the fate of the earth an element that 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.860
 in particular we love men 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.840
 and on the other hand an element of a 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.240
 love triangle that in particular 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 it is usually to women's liking this 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.770
 specifically it happened from the game 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.780
 ocarina of time since to be honest 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.000
 in the previous three cells this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.800
 effect had not been noticed at all and 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.500
 the majority that we enjoy said games 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.280
 we were only men because if you think about it 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.890
 well mario 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.380
 has the same elements that zelda a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.180
 hero a princess and a villain but 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.010
 then because women like it 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.650
 more zelda than mario bros and when I 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.510
 I mean like I mean worship 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 obviously there are hundreds of women who 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.590
 they love mario bros but not the same 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.080
 amount that they are so passionate about 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.300
 level game that cell fans 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.190
 they do this this must be one of the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.750
 more interesting turns in the course 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.580
 of the franchise since certainly 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.650
 attracted a lot of audience 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.600
 a female type of game that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.519
 women usually did not feel 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.440
 attracted being that the main 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.019
 games in which they unfold 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.269
 Puzzle simulation is in play 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.220
 and of objects are together if it is known 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.840
 a cell fanatic you 'll know there's 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.700
 one thing that unites us and is the fact 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.950
 that rangel link link is a pure being 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.140
 brave and reserved that would give life 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.280
 for defending the most important person 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.500
 of the whole kingdom 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.390
 the princess will be what creates a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.430
 ambiguity quite interesting because 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.200
 some women can interpret this 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.000
 he looks like he wants them 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.950
 rescue them and some men 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.900
 just like this one the warrior 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.600
 that is willing to save the world and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.180
 by way of rescue 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.730
 and both can be the right thing to do 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.650
 the great thing about it being ambiguous and the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.770
 princess zelda ocarina of time is 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.730
 They determined to make a character quite 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.770
 characteristic that not simply 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.840
 rescued kidnapped cell 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.580
 continuously but that does not make it weak 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.500
 since most of his kidnappings are 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.820
 by very powerful forces which neither 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.770
 even the same link that would be 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.750
 prepared to face and this again and in 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.390
 the game what strengthens you to win 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.160
 in the end let's be honest if he spent it 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.590
 all the time the training as what 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 he does and in that dungeons 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.280
 surely kicked him and the ass 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.930
 perhaps the fact that the princess to 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.730
 despite having a brave hero and 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 delivered that will save it in the end 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.120
 is a helpless being that simply 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.190
 wait but it does the same for 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.800
 help that savior what makes us the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.540
 girl feel empathy for them and winner 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.090
 that villain that we all love 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.130
 hate an evil entity with such reasons 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.500
 great to be a villain that men and 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.200
 women we would not remove equally with this 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.970
 between to defeat then we have a 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.340
 incredibly strong base that we 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.200
 motivates to play every game of zelda and 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.150
 our wait is commonly fine 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.110
 rewarded with imaginative games 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.870
 simple 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.640
 games with excellent music with a 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.280
 pretty creative world in which 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.260
 anyone can lose reason 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.540
 in which only round the 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.690
 fanaticism of every person to this game 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.430
 be it man or woman I say to men in 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.560
 We really like all videogames 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.480
 we are easy in that aspect the 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.580
 point is that with such a strong base of 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.560
 these three characters in such an environment 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.630
 universal and so easy to create immersion 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.340
 it's easy to see why men and women 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.860
 equally we enjoy both and 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.890
 fanatized this game is the best 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.480
 unisex game I do not know but if it's one of 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.610
 the best and one of the most 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.280
 You can easily tell your friend 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.700
 fraill or have a great adventure what 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.290
 you think is the best game mi6 al 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.150
 least competes as one of the best 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.430
 for me if it 's the best for something has 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.800
 survived more than 25 years without changing 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.990
 too leave your comments down and 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.330
 do not forget to subscribe to the spec 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.330
