said just a bar chord and you're playing
the<00:00:15.480> D<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> G<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.420> you<00:00:18.420> live<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.600> these

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the D and the G and you live in these

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.730 
the D and the G and you live in these
two<00:00:19.050> streams<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> am<00:00:20.699> open<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
two streams the in the am open so it

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.359 
two streams the in the am open so it
starts<00:00:22.980> off<00:00:23.130> two<00:00:23.430> strikes<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> D<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:25.369> then

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
starts off two strikes on the D and then

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.620 
starts off two strikes on the D and then
it<00:00:26.519> moves<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.060> night<00:00:27.930> threat<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it moves to the night threat on the a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.209 
it moves to the night threat on the a
string<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:34.340> then<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> goes<00:00:35.579> back<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:36.180> two<00:00:37.219> on

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
string so then it goes back for two on

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.529 
string so then it goes back for two on
the<00:00:38.370> D<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.790> then<00:00:42.620> goes<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> knife<00:00:45.090> MA

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the D and then goes back to the knife MA

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
the D and then goes back to the knife MA
and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.520> one<00:00:47.700> more<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> D<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.579> then
