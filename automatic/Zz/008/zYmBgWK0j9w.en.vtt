00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
this mission so I tried to do something

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.160 
this mission so I tried to do something
a<00:04:06.319> little<00:04:06.349> bit<00:04:06.560> different<00:04:07.040> here<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:08.019> tried<00:04:09.019> to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
a little bit different here I tried to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.199 
a little bit different here I tried to
see<00:04:09.379> if<00:04:09.409> I<00:04:09.890> could<00:04:09.950> use<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.579> weapon<00:04:10.940> and

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
see if I could use the weapon and

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.339 
see if I could use the weapon and
sunfire<00:04:12.549> competitively<00:04:13.549> against<00:04:14.180> these<00:04:15.079> guys

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
sunfire competitively against these guys

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.250 
sunfire competitively against these guys
feel<00:04:15.650> I<00:04:16.579> wasn't<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.269> best<00:04:17.419> idea<00:04:17.600> it's<00:04:18.049> very

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
feel I wasn't the best idea it's very

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.550 
feel I wasn't the best idea it's very
hard<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.709> judge<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.430> new<00:04:20.269> character<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:21.199> a

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
hard to judge a new character in a

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.560 
hard to judge a new character in a
team-up<00:04:21.889> mission<00:04:22.280> when<00:04:23.060> they<00:04:23.180> haven't<00:04:23.449> got

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
team-up mission when they haven't got

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.020 
team-up mission when they haven't got
there<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.780> so's<00:04:24.260> or<00:04:24.710> anything<00:04:25.250> useful<00:04:25.669> on<00:04:25.789> them

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
there I so's or anything useful on them

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.320 
there I so's or anything useful on them
I<00:04:26.289> do<00:04:27.289> see<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> lot<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:28.039> potential<00:04:28.520> for<00:04:28.850> sunfire

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
I do see a lot of potential for sunfire

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.670 
I do see a lot of potential for sunfire
so<00:04:29.720> far<00:04:30.050> he<00:04:30.650> just<00:04:30.889> needs<00:04:31.250> more<00:04:31.490> stat<00:04:32.180> I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
so far he just needs more stat I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.740 
so far he just needs more stat I
consider<00:04:33.680> using<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.310> new<00:04:34.970> weapon<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:35.570> I

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
consider using the new weapon but I

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.930 
consider using the new weapon but I
didn't<00:04:36.260> end<00:04:36.350> up<00:04:36.470> doing<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:36.949> Coulson's<00:04:37.550> revenge

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
didn't end up doing it Coulson's revenge

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.240 
didn't end up doing it Coulson's revenge
was<00:04:38.300> just<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.810> better<00:04:39.020> option<00:04:39.289> especially

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
was just the better option especially

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.250 
was just the better option especially
when<00:04:40.729> sunfire<00:04:41.240> still<00:04:41.599> gets<00:04:41.810> his<00:04:41.930> heated

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
when sunfire still gets his heated

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.650 
when sunfire still gets his heated
plasma<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.130> still<00:04:43.400> triggers<00:04:43.849> that<00:04:44.060> extra

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
plasma and it still triggers that extra

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.990 
plasma and it still triggers that extra
damage<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:45.229> thought<00:04:45.590> Human<00:04:46.010> Torch<00:04:46.190> should<00:04:46.490> be<00:04:46.699> a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
damage I thought Human Torch should be a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.080 
damage I thought Human Torch should be a
pretty<00:04:47.539> appropriate<00:04:48.110> ally<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:49.639> sunfire

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
pretty appropriate ally for the sunfire

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.540 
pretty appropriate ally for the sunfire
getting<00:04:50.570> those<00:04:50.720> burns<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.349> there<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.830> was<00:04:52.340> also

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
getting those burns in there I was also

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.610 
getting those burns in there I was also
considering<00:04:53.120> Red<00:04:53.419> Hulk<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:54.020> I<00:04:54.169> have<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> bit<00:04:54.590> of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
considering Red Hulk but I have a bit of

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.189 
considering Red Hulk but I have a bit of
a<00:04:54.740> soft<00:04:55.010> spot<00:04:55.130> for<00:04:55.669> Human<00:04:56.150> Torch<00:04:56.360> he<00:04:56.780> won<00:04:56.990> me<00:04:57.169> a

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
a soft spot for Human Torch he won me a

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.560 
a soft spot for Human Torch he won me a
lot<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.500> PvP<00:04:57.949> battles<00:04:57.979> in<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.550> early<00:04:58.940> days<00:04:59.150> so

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
lot of PvP battles in the early days so

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.779 
lot of PvP battles in the early days so
human<00:05:00.020> torture<00:05:00.320> was<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:01.070> this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.639> low

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
human torture was and this is the low

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.820 
human torture was and this is the low
point<00:05:01.820> for<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.300> battle<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:02.780> forgot<00:05:03.470> about<00:05:03.530> the

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
point for the battle I forgot about the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.089 
point for the battle I forgot about the
proximity<00:05:04.190> mines<00:05:04.610> on<00:05:05.060> sun<00:05:05.690> fire<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:07.270> well<00:05:08.270> and

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
proximity mines on sun fire and well and

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.810 
proximity mines on sun fire and well and
bam<00:05:10.099> Sun<00:05:10.940> fires<00:05:11.240> down

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.030 

I<00:05:13.880> keep<00:05:14.390> using<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.810> hand<00:05:15.230> to<00:05:15.410> try<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.680> make<00:05:15.890> it

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
I keep using that hand to try to make it

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.630 
I keep using that hand to try to make it
useful<00:05:16.280> but<00:05:16.910> it's<00:05:17.450> just<00:05:17.990> really<00:05:18.500> not<00:05:19.010> doing<00:05:19.340> it

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
useful but it's just really not doing it

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.780 
useful but it's just really not doing it
for<00:05:19.670> me<00:05:20.140> Human<00:05:21.140> Torch<00:05:21.170> takes<00:05:21.650> out<00:05:21.830> fixer<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.550> I

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
for me Human Torch takes out fixer and I

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.610 
for me Human Torch takes out fixer and I
completely<00:05:23.150> forgot<00:05:23.690> that<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.960> main<00:05:24.170> boss<00:05:24.410> is

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
completely forgot that the main boss is

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.530
