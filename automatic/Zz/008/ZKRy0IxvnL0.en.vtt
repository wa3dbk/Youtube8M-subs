workhorse that will keep running to the

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.550 
workhorse that will keep running to the
day<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.659> die

you

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.710 

and<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:26.199> says<00:00:26.380> RS<00:00:26.890> on<00:00:27.160> there<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.610> that<00:00:28.480> means

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
and it says RS on there and that means

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.320 
and it says RS on there and that means
round<00:00:29.080> shader<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.099> that's<00:00:30.759> what<00:00:30.939> you<00:00:31.060> want<00:00:31.240> to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
use the round shader that's going to be

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.280 
use the round shader that's going to be
shading<00:00:33.850> that's<00:00:34.030> for<00:00:34.180> shading<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.840> for<00:00:35.140> your

kit but you'll have to have a couple of
rubber<00:02:29.920> bands<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.549> just<00:02:31.480> slide<00:02:31.720> them<00:02:31.930> up<00:02:32.080> over

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
rubber bands and just slide them up over

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.890 
rubber bands and just slide them up over
like<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:33.579> holds<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.060> bar<00:02:34.239> down<00:02:34.569> on<00:02:34.779> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
like so that holds the bar down on the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110 
like so that holds the bar down on the
armature<00:02:35.290> bar<00:02:35.469> and<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:36.370> creates<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.849> shock

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
armature bar and it creates like a shock

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.280 
armature bar and it creates like a shock
absorber<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:37.689> that<00:02:37.810> when<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.019> needles

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
absorber so that when the needles

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.450 
absorber so that when the needles
hitting<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.560> skin<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:38.980> stays<00:02:39.219> in

hitting the skin it stays in

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.750 
hitting the skin it stays in
nice<00:02:39.610> smooth<00:02:40.120> motion<00:02:40.890> now<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.490> want<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
nice smooth motion now you want to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.150 
nice smooth motion now you want to
adjust<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.270> needles<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.710> how<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.920> do

this<00:02:45.520> I'll<00:02:45.880> usually<00:02:46.150> bring<00:02:46.510> them<00:02:46.630> out<00:02:46.720> just

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
this I'll usually bring them out just

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.950 
this I'll usually bring them out just
about<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:49.120> where<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.360> can't<00:02:49.570> barely

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.220 
pieces on you go to a piece like this
size<00:04:14.080> right<00:04:14.410> here<00:04:14.880> okay<00:04:15.880> now<00:04:16.450> something<00:04:17.080> like

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
size right here okay now something like

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.380 
size right here okay now something like
that<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.799> would<00:04:17.860> outline<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.730> with<00:04:18.940> probably

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
that I would outline that with probably

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.950 
that I would outline that with probably
a<00:04:19.420> seven<00:04:19.989> round<00:04:20.650> liner<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.300> then<00:04:22.300> fill<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.810> in

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
a seven round liner and then fill it in

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.040 
a seven round liner and then fill it in
well<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.950> after<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.970> retrospect<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.900> could

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
well and after a retrospect I could

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.320 
well and after a retrospect I could
probably<00:04:26.230> use<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:26.770> get<00:04:27.640> away<00:04:27.790> with<00:04:28.030> using

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
probably use and get away with using

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.170 
probably use and get away with using
about<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.570> 9<00:04:28.900> mag<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:30.010> fill<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.460> all<00:04:30.730> in<00:04:30.970> and

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
about a 9 mag to fill this all in and

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.780 
about a 9 mag to fill this all in and
get<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.780> colors<00:04:32.080> all<00:04:32.260> blended<00:04:32.680> in<00:04:32.800> with<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.250> so

get the colors all blended in with so so
