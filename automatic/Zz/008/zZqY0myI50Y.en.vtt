and then I'm going to cut this in half

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.910 
and then I'm going to cut this in half
now<00:04:31.860> when<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.670> bottom<00:04:32.880> layer<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.800> want<00:04:34.800> to

now when I do the bottom layer I want to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.040 
now when I do the bottom layer I want to
use<00:04:35.070> ten<00:04:35.520> feet<00:04:35.940> lows<00:04:36.120> for<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.420> bottom<00:04:36.930> and
