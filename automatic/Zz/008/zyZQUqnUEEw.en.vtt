have<00:02:33.519> this<00:02:33.640> figure<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.300> wireless<00:02:34.510> thing

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.650 
have this figure on the wireless thing
and<00:02:35.500> once<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.459> does<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.640> full<00:02:36.850> cycle<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.600> have

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660
