00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello my name is the thing that comes in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.290
 China Overview on the cube 7 7 let alone my 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.759
 the cube came out relatively recently in summer 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.040
 that is, 2014, why is there an end 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.779
 lanaform to friends about this i will tell 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.340
 a little later on the same cubes pasted 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.990
 fluorescent stickers they are very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 high-quality bright but they have and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.019
 nozzles they move out easily so when 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 you transport it 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.719
 jackets neatly sim professions can 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.380
 go stickers have already removed a few 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.469
 times and sent here even have some 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 which people corrected well initially 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.890
 not stuck 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 ideally exactly so torsion cubito 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.239
 very similar to the cube cheater pin my 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 hair 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.489
 he is also in charge 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:02.510
 well controlled and no different 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.510
 high speed of course turns easily 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.369
 our show me which is now 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 top they top up faster as 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.830
 time I took the suction to the skill let's 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.869
 compare the size and visually 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.140
 and ufa is not much bigger than a tire 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.900
 one feels that we are more so 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.000
 distance from center to center died by 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 great mood between corners 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.829
 about the same so now let's 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.829
 show it by structure 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.020
 here compared sheng shou introduced 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.650
 innovations can be said added here 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.730
 These are the torpedo ki 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:02:00.840
 that is, on the corner here it is this element 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:04.890
 here it is immediately visible and here now 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.980
 looking for a syndrome show how it looks in 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.980
 compilation 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:16.080
 here we see such a line thanks 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.650
 this line 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.690
 cube less than a speech therapist under the well and also 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.560
 there is okushok what blocker so 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:36.990
 central 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:41.270
 the elements are also a thoughtful structure in 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:48.410
 corners there is such a notch 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:51.410
 this is done for this 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.410
 connects 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.740
 you keep very well as in all 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.650
 clubs in my club and I have frogs and 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.840
 the seven is arranged in no way control 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.120
 that is, the show noise on to the union puts on 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.250
 first the central elements are the corners and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.480
 then on all this construct he dresses 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.670
 central ribs right there caffeine 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.710
 first worn rib clamped 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.140
 central then before rib then 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.090
 corners and so on 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.890
 thanks to this design, the cube can 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.000
 explode 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.600
 so I advise you not particularly 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.470
 stretch to prevent this from happening 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:41.570
 On my cube who already set up such 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.540
 there is no setup process such 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.370
 happened a couple of times I am very pleased 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:54.380
 phenomenon so now let me compare it 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:57.170
 Fuzhou semicircle, if not so hidden 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.900
 how these two elements come in 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.220
 edge 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:10.510
 here and so we have to get and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:14.320
 fibro rather even two ribs because 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:18.280
 one can not be removed 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.280
 everything needs to be corrected here 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:32.470
 far long period 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.470
 but fulgar who can't sang 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.979
 Cuba as unstable of course Monica 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.740
 lookup how here such will be responsible for 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:53.919
 snails 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:58.849
 well tried to expose but a 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:02.780
 so about K-pop is much less and its simpler 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.539
 set up so now about how 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.090
 aig remove shock show or raf I you 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.729
 I advise you to take it and if you are a beginner and not 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.599
 know which club to take because he 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.000
 turns very nicely he does not require 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.550
 special knowledge in settings also on it 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.449
 pasted very nice stickers our 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.280
 the show goes terrible stickers at the beginning 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:29.780
 Blue can create new recipes 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:35.060
 out of the box is very nice so with regards to 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.699
 me and I screwed in about a week my 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.550
 the time was originally it was 310 now 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.780
 255 while our show I'm going 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.099
 it's over 250 253 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.099
 this is my average 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:56.000
 On Ufa, I occasionally do do the assembly 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.750
 and the time falls i mean i think soon 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.389
 time, time will be the best of our show I 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.289
 go to this injection and for now 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:10.120
 my own cube is the noise of the show so now 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:14.330
 Finally, I will touch on the disc of angles on the seven 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.630
 so that's cutting corners like let's say 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.630
 angle 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:33.840
 our shows he jams 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:34.350
 spouse, and even now this is now like 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.980
 ancient 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:42.530
 Olaf has a small GUION 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.530
 after them cuts and very nice experience 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.490
 at this all thank you all for your attention 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.490
 until
