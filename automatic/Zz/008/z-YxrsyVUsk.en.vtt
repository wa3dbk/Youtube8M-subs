00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I'm I've decided to redo my steering

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.230 
I'm I've decided to redo my steering
system<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.770> kart<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.090> bit

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
system on my go kart because it's a bit

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.950 
system on my go kart because it's a bit
dodgy<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.400> when<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> turned<00:00:23.699> corners<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.330> it's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
dodgy and when I turned corners the it's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.640 
dodgy and when I turned corners the it's
not<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> steering<00:00:25.710> wheel<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:27.650> goes

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
not like a steering wheel it's it goes

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
not like a steering wheel it's it goes
into<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:29.010> leg<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.400> sort<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.789> yeah<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.599> not

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
into my leg in sort of yeah it's not

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.319 
into my leg in sort of yeah it's not
very<00:00:30.990> good<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.439> also<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.520> area<00:00:33.090> down<00:00:33.300> here

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
very good and also this area down here

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.430 
very good and also this area down here
isn't<00:00:33.930> very<00:00:33.989> good<00:00:34.350> either<00:00:35.149> I<00:00:36.170> mean<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.230> works

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
isn't very good either I mean it works

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.360 
isn't very good either I mean it works
but<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.600> safe<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but it's not very safe so I'm going to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.060 
but it's not very safe so I'm going to
redo<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:42.559> first<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.920> make

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
redo it all first I'm going to make

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000 
redo it all first I'm going to make
these<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.340> T<00:00:44.730> sort<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> things<00:00:46.010> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
these little T sort of things but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.880 
these little T sort of things but
they'll<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.399> angles<00:00:48.090> like

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.139 

like<00:00:55.520> it<00:00:55.790> will<00:00:55.940> be<00:00:55.970> like<00:00:56.210> this<00:00:57.309> up<00:00:58.309> I'm<00:00:59.030> going

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
like it will be like this up I'm going

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.069 
like it will be like this up I'm going
to<00:00:59.239> change<00:00:59.450> the<00:00:59.600> color<00:01:01.510> change<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.720> green

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
to change the color change the green

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.000 
to change the color change the green
that<00:01:03.410> will<00:01:03.530> do<00:01:04.780> it's<00:01:05.780> going<00:01:06.020> very<00:01:06.500> slow

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
that will do it's going very slow

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that will do it's going very slow
because<00:01:07.220> i'm<00:01:07.520> running<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.290> screen<00:01:09.290> video<00:01:09.560> here

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
because i'm running a screen video here

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.890 
because i'm running a screen video here
so<00:01:11.030> be<00:01:12.250> I'll<00:01:13.250> do<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.640> from<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:14.030> angle<00:01:14.210> be<00:01:14.720> like

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
so be I'll do it from this angle be like

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.390 
so be I'll do it from this angle be like
that<00:01:15.110> no<00:01:16.900> here<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:17.930> let<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:19.720> are<00:01:20.720> on

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
that no here we let that are on

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.240 
that no here we let that are on
confusing<00:01:22.400> myself<00:01:22.580> now<00:01:23.380> no<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.920> will<00:01:25.100> be<00:01:25.130> like

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
confusing myself now no it will be like

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.560 
confusing myself now no it will be like
that<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.140> bearing<00:01:30.440> block<00:01:30.619> will<00:01:30.830> sit<00:01:31.190> here

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.719 

this<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> side<00:01:36.140> view<00:01:36.170> over<00:01:36.649> to<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:37.009> shaft

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
this is a side view over to the shaft

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.210 
this is a side view over to the shaft
will<00:01:37.940> come<00:01:38.410> through<00:01:39.410> here<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.690> out<00:01:41.810> there

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
will come through here and out there

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.850 
will come through here and out there
this<00:01:43.220> thing<00:01:43.399> will<00:01:43.700> be<00:01:44.000> there<00:01:44.929> ish<00:01:45.289> and<00:01:45.649> then

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
this thing will be there ish and then

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.690 
this thing will be there ish and then
there'll<00:01:46.009> be<00:01:46.039> another<00:01:46.340> T<00:01:46.780> down<00:01:47.780> here<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:52.550> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
there'll be another T down here that the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.109 
there'll be another T down here that the
bearing<00:01:53.030> block<00:01:53.240> will<00:01:53.479> obviously<00:01:53.960> sit<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:56.470> and

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
bearing block will obviously sit on and

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.990 
bearing block will obviously sit on and
that<00:01:59.119> shaft<00:01:59.450> if<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.840> was<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> straight<00:02:00.530> one

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
that shaft if it was a straight one

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.999 
that shaft if it was a straight one
would<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:02.210> like<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.380> yeah<00:02:06.770> be

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
would go like so and then so yeah be

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.919 
would go like so and then so yeah be
like<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:07.790> those<00:02:08.149> teas<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.810> make

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
like that and then those teas I can make

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.419 
like that and then those teas I can make
with<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.170> same<00:02:09.350> metal<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.739> didn't<00:02:10.009> miss<00:02:10.250> I

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
with the same metal I didn't miss I

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.310 
with the same metal I didn't miss I
don't<00:02:10.459> after<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.910> any<00:02:11.090> fancy<00:02:11.959> metal<00:02:12.230> I

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
don't after you any fancy metal I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.720 
don't after you any fancy metal I
already<00:02:12.530> got<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.829> laying<00:02:13.130> around<00:02:13.459> which<00:02:13.610> is

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
already got that laying around which is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.940 
already got that laying around which is
good<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.510> shaft<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.140> probably<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.739> buy

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
good the shaft I probably have to buy

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.800 
good the shaft I probably have to buy
but<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.549> can<00:02:16.820> just<00:02:16.940> get<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.150> from<00:02:17.269> Bunning<00:02:17.660> so

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
but I can just get it from Bunning so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.860 
but I can just get it from Bunning so
it's<00:02:17.989> not<00:02:18.170> much<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.250> deal<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:20.570> square

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
it's not much of a deal that square

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.199 
it's not much of a deal that square
piece<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.170> metal<00:02:21.290> there<00:02:21.560> I'll<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.400> either

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
piece of metal there I'll have to either

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.259 
piece of metal there I'll have to either
buy<00:02:23.600> or<00:02:23.930> try<00:02:24.829> to<00:02:24.890> scavenge<00:02:25.640> from<00:02:25.850> something

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
buy or try to scavenge from something

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.800 
buy or try to scavenge from something
because<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.290> don't<00:02:27.320> really<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.510> yet<00:02:29.510> but

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
because I don't really have that yet but

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.330 
because I don't really have that yet but
i<00:02:30.049> can<00:02:30.560> probably<00:02:30.709> get<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.010> pretty<00:02:31.190> easily

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
i can probably get that pretty easily

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.220 
i can probably get that pretty easily
anyway<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.060> then<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.570> need<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> steering<00:02:33.110> wheel

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
anyway and then I need a steering wheel

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.300 
anyway and then I need a steering wheel
also<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:35.110> I'll<00:02:36.110> gather<00:02:36.350> all<00:02:36.560> my<00:02:36.680> parts<00:02:37.010> first

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
also so I'll gather all my parts first

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.580 
also so I'll gather all my parts first
and<00:02:37.670> then<00:02:37.940> fit<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.510> all<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.930> day<00:02:39.140> because<00:02:39.410> I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
and then fit it all in a day because I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.100 
and then fit it all in a day because I
don't<00:02:39.860> want<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.100> have<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.519> nonworking<00:02:41.510> go<00:02:41.840> kart

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
don't want to have a nonworking go kart

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.020 
don't want to have a nonworking go kart
for<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.380> week<00:02:42.590> while<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.370> get<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> steering<00:02:44.000> wheel

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
for a week while I get a steering wheel

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.620 
for a week while I get a steering wheel
so<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.720> might<00:02:45.650> gather<00:02:46.519> all<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.820> parts<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
so I might gather all the parts in a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.170 
so I might gather all the parts in a
week<00:02:48.140> or<00:02:48.320> two<00:02:48.500> weeks<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:49.100> like<00:02:49.820> over<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
week or two weeks and then like over a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.060 
week or two weeks and then like over a
period<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.630> two<00:02:50.810> weeks<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:51.440> fit<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.040> all

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
period of two weeks and then fit it all

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.160 
period of two weeks and then fit it all
in<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.400> day<00:02:52.579> because<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.750> won't<00:02:53.900> take<00:02:54.049> very

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
in a day because this won't take very

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.990 
in a day because this won't take very
long<00:02:54.350> I'll<00:02:54.560> have<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.769> do<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.040> weld<00:02:55.400> up<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.730> tease

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
long I'll have to do is weld up to tease

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.500 
long I'll have to do is weld up to tease
the<00:02:56.359> bearing<00:02:56.989> blocks<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:58.370> weld<00:02:58.579> them<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.880> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
the bearing blocks and weld them on the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.960 
the bearing blocks and weld them on the
bearing<00:02:59.780> blocks<00:02:59.930> would<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.230> bolt<00:03:00.470> on

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
bearing blocks would just bolt on

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.120 
bearing blocks would just bolt on
that'll<00:03:01.970> world<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:03.230> will<00:03:03.349> world<00:03:03.560> on
