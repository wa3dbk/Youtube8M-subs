this<00:00:21.720> video<00:00:21.990> we're<00:00:22.109> gonna<00:00:22.170> break<00:00:22.470> down<00:00:22.740> both

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
this video we're gonna break down both

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.920 
this video we're gonna break down both
but<00:00:23.490> let's<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> usage<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
but let's start out with the usage and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
but let's start out with the usage and
why<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.230> would<00:00:25.650> choose<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.160> climb<00:00:26.430> storm

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
why you would choose the climb storm

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.400 
why you would choose the climb storm
really<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.050> shell<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
really it's going to be a shell a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
really it's going to be a shell a
gore-tex<00:00:28.800> performance<00:00:29.760> shell<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.359> there's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
gore-tex performance shell and there's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.690 
gore-tex performance shell and there's
no<00:00:31.080> insulation<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.309> means<00:00:32.550> is

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
no insulation here so what that means is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
no insulation here so what that means is
typically<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.870> designed<00:00:34.200> for

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

more powder oriented temperatures a lot

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470 
more powder oriented temperatures a lot
of<00:00:40.410> times<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.190> guys<00:00:41.640> want<00:00:41.940> big-time

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of times we see guys want big-time

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
of times we see guys want big-time
insulation<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.379> icier<00:00:43.829> humid

are<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.620> designed<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.579> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730

powder<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> same<00:00:50.820> note<00:00:51.270> you're<00:00:51.629> going

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
powder now on the same note you're going

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
powder now on the same note you're going
to<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> both<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> jacket<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to see that in both the jacket and the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
to see that in both the jacket and the
pant<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.910> climb<00:00:54.270> storm<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.739> actually

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
pant the climb storm is actually

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.619 
pant the climb storm is actually
designed<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.670> tremendous<00:00:57.030> breathability

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
designed for tremendous breathability

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
designed for tremendous breathability
and<00:00:57.899> airflow<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> remember<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.920> gore-tex

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and airflow and remember it is gore-tex

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
and airflow and remember it is gore-tex
in<00:00:59.640> both<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.510> waterproof<00:01:00.840> breathable

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in both so it's waterproof breathable

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
in both so it's waterproof breathable

there's no moisture that gets in but as

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
there's no moisture that gets in but as

note<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.920> fitment<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:15.240> before<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
note on fitment and actually before I

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.670 
note on fitment and actually before I
dive<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.869> fitment<00:01:16.200> let's<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.500> talk<00:01:16.650> about

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
dive into fitment let's just talk about

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.560 
dive into fitment let's just talk about
where<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> falls<00:01:17.340> within<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> line<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.210> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
where it falls within the line if you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.969 
where it falls within the line if you
want<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> Gore<00:01:19.140> Pro<00:01:19.409> shell<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> you're

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
want to go to Gore Pro shell and you're

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
want to go to Gore Pro shell and you're
looking<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> shell<00:01:20.970> side<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> things

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
looking at just the shell side of things

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.330 
looking at just the shell side of things
that<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> pick<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.560> own<00:01:22.650> base<00:01:22.890> layers<00:01:23.159> with

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that you pick your own base layers with

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460 
that you pick your own base layers with
I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> Valdez<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> next<00:01:24.990> step<00:01:25.290> in

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
I think the Valdez is the next step in

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260 
I think the Valdez is the next step in
this<00:01:25.560> journey<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.250> climb<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.150> know

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this journey from climb you know

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.030 
this journey from climb you know
incrementally<00:01:27.780> invent<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> an

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
incrementally invent more of an

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.590 
incrementally invent more of an
investment<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.000> you're<00:01:30.119> looking<00:01:30.299> for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
investment and if you're looking for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.670 
investment and if you're looking for
something<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> equivalent

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
something that's really the equivalent

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
something that's really the equivalent
but<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> has<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
but it has but it's going to have a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
but it has but it's going to have a
heavy-duty<00:01:34.320> insulative<00:01:35.130> quality<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> like

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
heavy-duty insulative quality to it like

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
heavy-duty insulative quality to it like
