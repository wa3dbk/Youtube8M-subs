00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
supposed to stand like that way but I've

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.220 
supposed to stand like that way but I've
just<00:02:31.890> turned<00:02:32.130> them<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.519> other<00:02:32.640> way<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.989> they

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
just turned them the other way and they

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.620 
just turned them the other way and they

them<00:03:31.640> into<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:32.030> wood<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:32.959> can<00:03:33.140> dangle<00:03:33.560> some

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
them into the wood so I can dangle some

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.220 
them into the wood so I can dangle some
stuff<00:03:34.220> off<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:34.790> it's<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.540> bit<00:03:35.660> more<00:03:35.840> like
