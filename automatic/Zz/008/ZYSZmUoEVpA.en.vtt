that<00:05:45.840> alone<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.139> mean<00:05:46.380> getting<00:05:46.710> combos<00:05:47.190> on<00:05:47.340> this

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
that alone I mean getting combos on this

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.180 
that alone I mean getting combos on this
is<00:05:48.330> possible<00:05:49.020> with<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.350> tard<00:05:49.560> rank<00:05:49.950> higher

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
is possible with the tard rank higher

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.260 
is possible with the tard rank higher
and<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.639> minecart<00:05:51.120> but<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:52.080> mean<00:05:52.980> it<00:05:53.190> it's<00:05:54.030> not

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
and the minecart but I mean it it's not

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.409 
and the minecart but I mean it it's not
really<00:05:54.450> good<00:05:54.810> realistic<00:05:55.620> ah<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:56.880> trap<00:05:57.150> 'less

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
really good realistic ah the trap 'less

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.840 
really good realistic ah the trap 'less
the<00:05:58.200> trap<00:05:58.470> list<00:05:58.680> is<00:05:58.770> going<00:05:58.950> too<00:05:59.010> far<00:05:59.040> outweigh

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
the trap list is going too far outweigh

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.210 
the trap list is going too far outweigh
any<00:05:59.880> any<00:06:00.630> amount<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.050> combos<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:01.500> think<00:06:01.650> you<00:06:01.740> can
