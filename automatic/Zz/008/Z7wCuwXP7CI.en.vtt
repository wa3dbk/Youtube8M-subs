00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.511
 How to have a rainbow 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.811
 How to hug a summer wind 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.981
 The stars in the sky laugh at the people on the ground 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.481
 I can’t always understand and can’t feel enough 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.701
 If I fall in love with your smile 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.951
 How to collect how to have it 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.191
 If you are happy, not for me. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.601
 Will you let go? 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.241
 When a gust of wind blows a kite to the sky 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.251
 Moved to bless you for your blessing 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.021
 Finally, your figure disappears at the end of the sea. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.541
 I found that laughing and crying hurts the most. 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.151
 That day you and my hill 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.241
 That singing the song of that year 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.871
 That kind of memory is enough 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.371
 Enough for me to taste loneliness every day. 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.791
 When a gust of wind blows a kite to the sky 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.761
 Moved to bless you for your blessing 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.831
 Finally, your figure disappears at the end of the sea. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.251
 I found that laughing and crying hurts the most. 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.801
 When a gust of wind blows a kite to the sky 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.941
 Moved to bless you for your blessing 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.881
 Finally, your figure disappears at the end of the sea. 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:01.821
 I found that laughing and crying hurts the most. 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.161
 If I fall in love with your smile 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.671
 How to collect how to have it 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.831
 If you are happy, then not for me. 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.011
 Will you let go? 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.491
 Happy contentment makes me suffer heartache 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500
 Happy contentment makes me suffer heartache
