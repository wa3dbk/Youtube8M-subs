 welcome to arvida kitchen today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.490
 I will show you how to make a 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.980
 very easy chocolate sponge cake go 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 Let's go 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.180
 so for the Genoese recipe 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.330
 we will need 250 g of sugar 5 th 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.519
 whole 250 g flour 1 sachet of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.599
 baking powder and 2 tablespoons 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.080
 cocoa powder then in a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.250
 bowl 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:39.930
 I break but uh here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.820
 I add my sugar and I will whip 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.820
 to make everything sparkling 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.220
 here it is necessary that its double volume 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:14.270
 that's it now so I'm not going to 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:18.380
 so say my flour with cocoa 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.990
 in powder and my bag of yeast 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 chemical 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 here 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.610
 Here I can mix that one 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.820
 So, but here I am incorporating powder 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.360
 so in two or three times to my mix 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.460
 previous 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.390
 finally I go but both times and I 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.610
 go gently 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.660
 here I go below and I raise 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.660
 the recipe is really easy huh 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:08.350
 here I am putting powder and I believe 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:11.140
 that he had so on now that I put 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.260
 that aside and then I go so 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.030
 butter a silicone mold 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.840
 to make sure that the mold is 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.840
 go great 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.040
 so I said my oven to preheated to 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.239
 160 Â° here is where I pour all my 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.239
 paw in my mill 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.110

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.320
 in that bake for about 20 to 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.390
 25 minutes so at 160 degrees go this is 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.430
