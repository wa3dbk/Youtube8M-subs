00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.280
 it is true as the elements said 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 of a meaningful life for each one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 we are going to have different elements 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.320
 different things that are going to be 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.119
 meaning in life I have one of the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.560
 basic things is how can we be 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 happy if we have a life 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 meaningful we can be very happy 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.949
 around this and what this entails 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 it is therefore to first have an occupation one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 structured activity that makes us 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.469
 feel productive in life not 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.510
 I necessarily want to say produce 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.640
 money well they said it not for all the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.530
 money is like the essential thing but feeling 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.270
 productive and feel useful to feel 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 part of a system where my 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.780
 collaboration contributes to the well-being of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.730
 others and of course also at 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 welfare of mine not this would be like one of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 the first elements to consider as 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.850
 we can be part of the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.949
 family of a work system with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 companions in addition to the community 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.910
 also with the neighbors themselves not what 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 is my place in this in this space and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 what would happen if I was not around 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 course that feeling that we are not 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.540
 indispensable but nevertheless we are 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.580
 required 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.350
 as for these human interactions 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.540
 that we all have because the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 we are a significant life too 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.010
 It comes from knowing that we are valuable because 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 ask us when 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.130
 we see a baby we think he is valuable 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.420
 and good or not good and why then in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.670
 certain moment of life 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 we think we stopped doing it because 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 suddenly we feel as empty as 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.180
 meaningless like we do not matter without 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 that the essence of every human being is to be 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 important is for the mere fact of being 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.520
 a living being and being in this world is already 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 an achievement then that we do not forget 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.170
 that we once were for someone 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.330
 we had very important 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.890
 good people and that little by little good 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.200
 the experiences are transforming us 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.920
 times intolerance impatience 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.840
 sometimes the experiences with other people 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.580
 they are making us hard as they are going 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.350
 doing how inflexible but that is not 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.810
 forget us that down there is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.430
 a significant essence for all of me 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 I think if we give a lot of priority 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.450
 the one that pulls the people the common one is going to me 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.000
 see people if the circumstances that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.780
 they mark us the life that sad suddenly 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.540
 is to want to give 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.240
 to others losing our own 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.130
 clear value but understand the elements 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.530
 it is very important this 1 when 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.970
 we think about self-esteem there 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.610
 than to think what is self-esteem and be 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.220
 estimated and in the estimated being there are two 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.650
 elements one who esteems and another is 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.510
 what is esteemed or is I the one 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 esteem the one who estimates me can have me 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.290
 distortions may be that for that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.480
 person what I do is not so 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.190
 estimable as I see myself I do not know so 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.410
 estimable but that nothing is going to 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.050
 demerit who I am my essence 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 meaningful is to say someone could not 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.890
 to like him but that does not make me 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.750
 a bad person there I can fall very 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.580
 well and may adore my tell you that I am 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.709
 the most that's why it does not make me 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.780
 in a wonderful person I am like I am 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.790
 because who I am is becoming a 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.950
 through my actions my actions from 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.450
 day by day the sum of my actions the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.069
 sum of my interactions with the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.230
 people are what they constitute 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.459
 as people so I know there are 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.050
 people who will not fall very 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.790
 well I know that there are people who are 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.220
 it's going to fall pretty well and yet my 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.019
 essence remains if I'm going to leave 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.240
 carry what I'm told by those who do not 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.250
 I like them, I'm going to make changes 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.050
 to fall well maybe those people for the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.910
 that before and now no longer and if you leave me 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.920
 carried away by praise and flattery 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.590
 Well, I'm going to trust and I'll say look 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.630
 How good I am and I do not look for change anymore 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 I look for evolution then know who 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.650
 I am having a sense of identity that is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 basic to a meaningful life is 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.660
 also that you are constituting yourself with 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.310
 your thoughts and with your beliefs more 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.260
 with this you were saying is , 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.400
 that maybe with people think 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.380
 good of you that other people think 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.160
 Aunt mother in the end what they think 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.110
 this on your roll 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.580
 that 's what they see from me for the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.530
 topics that they will also bring for 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.300
 chips for all the things they expect in 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.310
 their little heads but I am who I am 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.050
 so I think I'm clear so 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.030
 that I believe and what I believe leads me to 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.370
 do things to the actions that I already do 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.350
 the inverse is true because I make certain 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.330
 things and certain things not good certain 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.160
 things and certain things not for the things 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.500
 that I think about the things that he believes in or 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.730
 for the values ​​that I have the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.440
 beliefs and values are 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.510
 fundamental are our engine for 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.370
 our act then when we 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.010
 we have some beliefs and values 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.510
 that go according to a social system a 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.150
 family system we are going to 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.080
 much better than when we have beliefs 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.300
 and values ​​that are crashing 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.520
 continuously with others when you say 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.350
 I am me and I do not care what 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.060
 think us it's true that we 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.530
 they do not constitute us but it is true 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.100
 also that we are social beings in 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.050
 scale 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.240
 we have to adapt and that is also 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.550
 a form of flexibility with the current 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.840
 environment with a current everton in exchange for 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.430
 Sometimes you are in a place where you are with 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.410
 more relaxed friends and we are counting 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.940
 jokes now improvements to rises of pitch 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.770
 sometimes you are in a work meeting 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.240
 where you have to keep your composure or 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.740
 Sometimes there is a place where you are in a 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.600
 wake for example or a party 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.640
 childish then it can not be all the 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.590
 time and that's not all the time thrown away 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.690
 playing on the ground and it depends where 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.000
 I am the way that I also have 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.110
 be able to adapt to those contexts without 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.450
 lose my essence 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.980
 many rigid people say daily 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.050
 of another we have playing with children in the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.400
 I 'm on the ground and you're going to go in a good suit 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.290
 because at the time the children wanted 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.880
 play and I gave myself the opportunity to 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.680
 doing that does not make me a 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.720
 immature simply turns me into a 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.880
 adult who can contextualize is 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.890
 with children if you are with elderly people 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.990
 also if we have to read or there is 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.610
 to put them serious and that does not take away my 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.050
 I can do many things 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.509
 simultaneously 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.090
 without losing who I am, that is, this 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.800
 identity that makes me believe 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.659
 Mario that is part of the personality 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.849
 from each one of us that leaves us 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.940
 It is not that we stop importing but that 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.710
 let's learn to live with him I do not know with 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.840
 which if I like him or do not fall 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.460
 I'm telling you this because I think that 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.470
 before good for example in my childhood 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.080
 I did not worry so much now about my 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.310
 sisters who care a little more about 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.479
 My level 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.180
 how they get involved or how 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.680
 they will say their companions I do not know if to me 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.370
 worried about the level as much as they 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.419
 do I feel that it is becoming more noticeable 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.069
 is that they are entering as in the 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.199
 exact adolescence I think that he and when 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.490
 you're a teenager I do not know if it hits me or 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.319
 If I think it's also a matter of 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.180
 personality of each one of us 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:22.229
 I know that adolescence is tolerance 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.240
 presence many say no because it is a 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.560
 suffer so much from the person who is 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.690
 living as of the people who 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.849
 we interact with them but I do not know if 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.680
 Now give him everything to take more to heart 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.419
 still the situation is that now now 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.069
 I 'm seeing it differently if I 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.440
 we have given a lot of weight to the question 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.810
 social the question of acceptance 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.300
 however we should not lose track 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.490
 that is not the only thing that constitutes us 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.200
 As we said earlier, others have 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.110
 an opinion but it is not the same opinion 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.210
 that to know the one that thinks about of me will be 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.370
 what that person sees what I give him 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.200
 project what that person has in 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.180
 As far as knowledge is concerned there is more 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.220
 people who can and can not see 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.200
 certain things about me like me there are also 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.150
 certain things that I do not see of myself but to 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.790
 through other people to me it seems to me 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.800
 very interesting to know what the others 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.780
 they think of me because it allows me variety 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.460
 and it allows me to review me if after 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.500
 a continuous and constant review and 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.820
 deep I say man this opinion that 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.740
 has that person does not go according to what 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.510
 that I feel I will take into account in case 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.670
 there is some other one to join but 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.100
 if I see that I appreciate that, it's also 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.660
 important to me I would like to say it 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.670
 in a strong way you know the opinion 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.410
 of my enemies that have of me because 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.450
 it's a big help because they're going to 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.980
 point out they're going to be grade 3 my mistakes and 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.900
 that will allow me to correct them before 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.790
 that they become overwhelmed then 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.290
 know the opinion of friends of not so 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.940
 friends people that I like and that 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.770
 I do not like them, it 's just a 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.729
 parameter should not be my reference 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.960
 to exist that definitely 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:49.210
 and if I have to keep practicing but 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.979
 I do and if it differs a little bit with you 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:54.180
 March, but right now, it does not focus on the 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:54.180
 theme that we have things
