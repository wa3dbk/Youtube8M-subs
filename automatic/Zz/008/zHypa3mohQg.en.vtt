that were coming out at that time it's
not<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.990> worst<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:01.650> definitely<00:04:01.830> one<00:04:02.130> of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
not the worst but it's definitely one of

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800 
not the worst but it's definitely one of
the<00:04:02.250> lower<00:04:02.430> ones<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.270> i<00:04:03.390> said<00:04:03.420> the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
maybe there is something there that can

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.830 
maybe there is something there that can
grab<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> certain<00:04:11.430> group<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.730> people<00:04:11.790> but<00:04:12.600> it

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
grab a certain group of people but it

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.210 
grab a certain group of people but it
certainly<00:04:13.200> didn't<00:04:13.530> grab<00:04:13.709> me<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:14.100> it

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
certainly didn't grab me and it

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.710 
certainly didn't grab me and it
certainly<00:04:14.430> didn't<00:04:14.760> grab<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.940> lot<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.270> audiences

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
certainly didn't grab a lot of audiences

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.660 
certainly didn't grab a lot of audiences
at<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.019> time<00:04:16.230> Black<00:04:16.709> Cauldron<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.340> often

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
at the time Black Cauldron is often

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.400 
at the time Black Cauldron is often
called<00:04:17.880> one<00:04:18.090> of<00:04:18.180> Disney's<00:04:18.540> biggest<00:04:18.989> failures

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
called one of Disney's biggest failures

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.340 
called one of Disney's biggest failures
I<00:04:19.650> think<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.430> kind<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:20.940> bad<00:04:21.200> not<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
I think it's just kind of a bad not the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.760 
I think it's just kind of a bad not the
worst<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:22.950> probably<00:04:23.250> skip
