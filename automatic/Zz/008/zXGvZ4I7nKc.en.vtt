00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
you get with this kit is you get the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.970 
you get with this kit is you get the
camera<00:01:00.460> which<00:01:00.670> as<00:01:01.450> I<00:01:01.720> stated<00:01:01.990> earlier<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.770> does

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
camera which as I stated earlier it does

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.190 
camera which as I stated earlier it does
have<00:01:03.220> 12<00:01:04.530> infrared<00:01:05.530> LEDs<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.789> also<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.630> capable

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
have 12 infrared LEDs it also is capable

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.630 
have 12 infrared LEDs it also is capable
of<00:01:08.439> recording<00:01:08.799> audio<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.590> has<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> CMOS

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
of recording audio so it has a CMOS

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.679 
of recording audio so it has a CMOS
sensor<00:01:13.539> inside<00:01:13.929> in<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:15.299> resolution<00:01:16.299> of<00:01:16.600> the

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
sensor inside in the resolution of the

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.679 
sensor inside in the resolution of the
video<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.140> 656<00:01:18.100> by<00:01:18.310> 492<00:01:19.240> pixels<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.569> what<00:01:22.569> you

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
video is 656 by 492 pixels so what you

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.679 
video is 656 by 492 pixels so what you
also<00:01:22.869> get<00:01:23.319> is<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.979> hundred<00:01:25.079> feet<00:01:26.079> of<00:01:26.439> cable<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
also get is a hundred feet of cable to

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.889 
also get is a hundred feet of cable to
set<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.520> camera<00:01:30.520> up<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.109> you<00:01:32.109> get<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:33.899> power

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
set the camera up and you get the power

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.069 
set the camera up and you get the power
cord<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.840> get<00:01:38.049> mounting<00:01:38.859> hardware<00:01:40.079> it's

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
cord and you get mounting hardware it's

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.899 
cord and you get mounting hardware it's
really<00:01:41.259> easy<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.619> use<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.009> just<00:01:42.520> plug<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909
