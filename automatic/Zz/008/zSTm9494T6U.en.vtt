00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
scoring but I think we're just a little

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.640 
scoring but I think we're just a little
stagnant<00:00:09.269> right<00:00:09.780> now<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.200> not<00:00:10.320> not<00:00:10.530> not

but<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:24.020> i<00:01:24.050> think<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.800> bell<00:01:24.920> was<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.190> very

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
but so i think that the bell was a very

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.890 
but so i think that the bell was a very
effective<00:01:25.640> way<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.940> play<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.300> team<00:01:26.480> hey

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900
