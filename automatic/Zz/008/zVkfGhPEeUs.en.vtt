00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.839
 the bike that we present today is the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.180
 third generation of the model more 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.549
 iconic ducati the monster to medium 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.080
 way between 6 and 69 1200 hard 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.660
 fully in the rising segment of the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.279
 800 is now the new access bike 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.279
 to the monster range the 821 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.440
 aesthetically and technologically benefited 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.300
 of his older sister the monsters 1200 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.789
 presented in the past room of Milan 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.469
 its powerful engine shares it with others 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.510
 brand models as hyper engine 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.489
 or the hyper estrada this engine is a 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.079
 bicilÃ­ndrico of this star with four 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.690
 valves per cylinder and refrigeration 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.670
 liquid delivers 112 nervous horses 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.860
 we can regulate this power 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 through three modes of sport driving 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.909
 touring with 112 horses its power 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.799
 total but with a little delivery 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.799
 different between one and another and urban 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.659
 reducing the power to 75 horses its 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.300
 clutch is bathed in oil and has 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.429
 an anti-rebound system thanks to this 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.350
 motor that is self-supporting the design of 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.720
 its tubular chassis is tiny gaining 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.789
 very lightness and rigidity and it goes 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.820
 anchored to the cylinder heads forming the motor 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.280
 part of the frame 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.080
 its part cycle guarantees us a touch 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 very sporty thanks to a fork 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.340
 inverted 43 millimeters but yes 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.020
 does not have any adjustment anymore 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.270
 rear monoshock that this one that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.710
 this monoshock is adjustable 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.630
 attached to a conventional swingarm of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.610
 steel this is one of the big 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.640
 differences with his older sister the 1200 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.840
 riding a lovely monkey arm 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.850
 continuing with the cycle part the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.550
 brakes are composed of two huge 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.110
 320 mm discs with a clamp 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.750
 of radial anchor of the brembo brand 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.220
 four-piston monoblock while 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 that in the rear train we found a 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.479
 single disk of 245 millimeters all 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 assisted by a series abs system 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.410
 with three levels of action that will go 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.570
 associated with the driving mode that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.040
 we have selected comes equipped with 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.350
 some very soft pirelli tires 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.060
 diablo rosso 2 that will keep us 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.500
 Monsters stuck to the ground besides 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.570
 also has a control of 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.610
 adjustable traction in five positions 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.870
 also associated with the driving mode 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 that we have selected in all 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.070
 moment what will maintain the atmosphere 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.720
 on rails your instrument cluster 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.980
 It is totally digital and shows 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.510
 a lot of information about 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.519
 engine parameters or set up 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.750
 selected but we miss something 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.670
 as simple as a indicated 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 of fuel level or the indicator 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.190
 of gear engaged his weight is 179 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.310
 kilos dry and 205 in running order 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.930
 being its deposit of 17.5 liters the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.520
 distance from the seat to the floor are 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.150
 seven hundred eighty-five millimeters 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.950
 in its low position and 810 in its high it is 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.780
 adjustable in two positions with it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.120
 ducati wants to reach a greater number 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.010
 of users we can only try it 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.320
 When I went to look for it, I could see how 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.910
 I was going by city now we're going to put it in 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.209
 its natural habitat the roads of 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.209
 curves 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.880
 let's test how it goes in your habitat 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.950
 we sang 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.860
 sound of ducati sound super 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.780
 blunt enough rugged 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.940
 I give four touches of gas and it seems that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.100
 let's have a good storm comment that 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.920
 in this third generation the ergonomics 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.960
 is much improved compared to the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.760
 second generation have served the 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.560
 handlebar 40 millimeters and they have also 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.990
 successful another 40 millimeters to the body 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.470
 with which we adopted a position a 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.670
 little natural to me that I like 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.060
 I'm on tiptoe when I do 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.280
 more in this educational encounter with 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.910
 some difficulty because if I get to 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.730
 tiptoes 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.170
 I have a little space the heels of 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.650
 the boots touch me in the writings 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:11.680
 but everything is getting used to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.680
 but we started with the sport mode 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.209
 a very aggressive direct power kiss 102 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.450
 horses but instant to the bottom 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.450
 Of gas 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.940
 with this mode 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.030
 Abs adjustments traction control 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.220
 are adjusted to the minimum right now it has 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.680
 pre-selected at a time level 1 of 3 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.110
 and the level of this control point of 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.820
 traction which means that the two 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.820
 cases will allow us a little 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.090
 engine very well or very well an answer 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.040
 very good what we do not have to leave 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.560
 to fall is the engine below three thousand 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.560
 laps because for everything quite 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.750
 despite having a suspension is a 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.280
 front fork to action 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.500
 regulation 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.660
 the hostel is both very good bush 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.040
 both direction changes 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.040
 spectacular is that neither is unchanging 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.490
 fork up very well the enormous 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.960
 braking of the front train because it brakes 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.020
 really good 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.479
 but nevertheless the rear brake of 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.389
 lack of lack of power power at 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.520
 touch if we want to get braking 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.500
 you have to press with luck with your foot 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.500
 so we will lose all touch 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.039
 spectacular moves 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.370
 the durable tires reserved a 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.139
 once they are warm 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.740
 they stick to the ground and it's a pass 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.740
 good 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.700
 bestial sound 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.210
 Y 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.210
 do not 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.150
 very funny 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.559
 or not 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.559
 spectacular 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.740
 we liked the behavior of his 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.139
 part cycle its aggressive aesthetics and its 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.340
 rabid engine would improve the absence 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.379
 of basic indicators such as 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.330
 fuel the contact of the leg with 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:17.250
 the collector if we neglect and the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.819
 extreme right as the foot rubs sometimes 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.819
 with the escape 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.770
 simply spectacular if you like 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.240
 Enjoy making curves road 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.240
 the 821 is your motorcycle
