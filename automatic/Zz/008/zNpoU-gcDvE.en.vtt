00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
when railway items from borders they

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.370 
when railway items from borders they
usually<00:01:05.549> actually<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.299> books<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.810> but

usually actually do get books there but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.990 
usually actually do get books there but
it<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> those<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:11.790> weird

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it was just in one of those really weird

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.260 
it was just in one of those really weird
cases<00:01:12.659> where<00:01:12.930> they<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.979> hadn't<00:01:14.280> sold<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
cases where they just hadn't sold it and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
cases where they just hadn't sold it and
so<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> decided<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.890> let's<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
so I decided to get it and let's see I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
so I decided to get it and let's see I
think<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.549> looked<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.150> Wilbur<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.869> it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
think I looked at this Wilbur and it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.770 
think I looked at this Wilbur and it's
from<00:01:23.509> 2003<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.720> sure

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
from 2003 I think I'm actually not sure

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770 
from 2003 I think I'm actually not sure
so<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:29.400> actually<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.150> check<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> here

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so I'm actually just gonna check it here

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410 
so I'm actually just gonna check it here
very<00:01:31.110> very<00:01:31.170> quick<00:01:31.590> turning<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> wheels<00:01:32.610> yeah

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
very very quick turning the wheels yeah

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.660 
very very quick turning the wheels yeah
it<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.659> from<00:01:33.810> 2003<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it is from 2003 that was actually a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.649 
it is from 2003 that was actually a
really<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.329> lucky<00:01:36.509> guess<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.210> makes

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
really really lucky guess but that makes

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.100 
really really lucky guess but that makes
sense<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.310> only<00:01:41.549> made<00:01:41.880> Wilbur<00:01:42.270> for

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
sense because they only made Wilbur for

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.490 
sense because they only made Wilbur for
about<00:01:43.380> two<00:01:43.680> years<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:48.659> 2000

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
about two years and that was in 2000

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
about two years and that was in 2000
that<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.829> I've<00:01:50.399> looked<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> pamphlet<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that was I've looked in the pamphlet I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
that was I've looked in the pamphlet I
thought<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> said<00:01:51.750> 2001<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.380> 2002<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
thought I said 2001 or 2002 but this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
thought I said 2001 or 2002 but this
Walbert<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.329> obviously<00:01:54.720> dated<00:01:55.049> 2003<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.040> maybe

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
Walbert is obviously dated 2003 so maybe

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.780 
Walbert is obviously dated 2003 so maybe
this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.619> lucky<00:01:58.619> find<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.520> learning

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
this is a lucky find or be a learning

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
this is a lucky find or be a learning
curve<00:01:59.909> mistake<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:01.140> good

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
curve mistake and I have a very good

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.450 
curve mistake and I have a very good
feeling<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.740> probably<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> learning<00:02:02.340> curve

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
feeling that's probably a learning curve

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.029 
feeling that's probably a learning curve
mistake<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.219> because<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:06.360> looked<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.020> my<00:02:07.320> 2007

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
mistake so because I looked in my 2007

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
mistake so because I looked in my 2007
yearbook<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> list<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
yearbook and they have a list of the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.390 
yearbook and they have a list of the
retired<00:02:09.720> friends<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.739> call<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
retired friends as they call them in the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.540 
retired friends as they call them in the
back<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
back and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.210 
back and
was<00:02:12.820> listed<00:02:13.090> as<00:02:13.210> 2001<00:02:13.720> or<00:02:13.870> 2002<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.130> know

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
was listed as 2001 or 2002 and I know

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.530 
was listed as 2001 or 2002 and I know
that<00:02:15.490> well<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:16.060> didn't<00:02:16.300> carry

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
that well I know they didn't carry

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.810 
that well I know they didn't carry
Wilbert<00:02:16.990> for<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:17.740> long<00:02:17.980> long<00:02:18.190> time<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.520> mean<00:02:18.640> it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
Wilbert for a long long time I mean it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.370 
Wilbert for a long long time I mean it
was<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.150> couple<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.480> years<00:02:19.780> that's<00:02:19.960> why<00:02:20.080> so

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
was just a couple of years that's why so

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.050 
was just a couple of years that's why so
rare<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.860> hard<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.490> find<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.850> turned

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
rare so hard to find now as it turned

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.110 
rare so hard to find now as it turned
upside<00:02:25.360> down<00:02:25.390> here<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.770> says<00:02:26.830> Wilbert<00:02:27.430> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
upside down here it says Wilbert and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.250 
upside down here it says Wilbert and
then<00:02:28.900> also<00:02:29.740> has<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> number<00:02:30.640> as<00:02:30.880> well<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:32.200> case

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
then also has a number as well in case

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.740 
then also has a number as well in case
of<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.620> recall<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.340> yeah<00:02:33.550> 2003<00:02:34.300> actually<00:02:34.600> does

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
of a recall so yeah 2003 actually does

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.330 
of a recall so yeah 2003 actually does
make<00:02:34.930> sense<00:02:35.200> because<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:35.950> showed<00:02:36.160> my

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
make sense because I just showed my

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.800 
make sense because I just showed my
Katherine<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:38.370> 2003<00:02:39.370> also<00:02:39.550> had<00:02:39.820> numbers<00:02:40.660> on

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
Katherine and 2003 also had numbers on

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.660 
Katherine and 2003 also had numbers on
the<00:02:40.900> bottom<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:41.980> actually<00:02:42.400> kind<00:02:42.610> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the bottom so that actually kind of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.180 
the bottom so that actually kind of
worked<00:02:42.850> out<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.270> guess<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.950> let's<00:02:45.130> just

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
worked out I guess and so let's just

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.980 
worked out I guess and so let's just
take<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> look<00:02:45.610> at<00:02:45.760> my<00:02:45.850> Wilbert<00:02:46.210> actually<00:02:46.720> so

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
take a look at my Wilbert actually so

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.950 
take a look at my Wilbert actually so
his<00:02:47.170> face<00:02:47.410> he<00:02:47.890> looks<00:02:48.130> happy<00:02:48.700> okay<00:02:49.450> he's<00:02:49.660> kind

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
his face he looks happy okay he's kind

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.660 
his face he looks happy okay he's kind
of<00:02:50.700> maybe<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.850> little<00:02:52.150> skeptical<00:02:53.580> I'm<00:02:54.580> not

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
of maybe a little skeptical I'm not

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.860 
of maybe a little skeptical I'm not
really<00:02:54.790> sure<00:02:55.030> what<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.450> save<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.840> that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
really sure what about the save up that

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.530 
really sure what about the save up that
face<00:02:56.230> oh<00:02:56.530> well<00:02:56.770> um<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.790> know<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.300> sounds<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
face oh well um I know it sounds a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.400 
face oh well um I know it sounds a
little<00:02:58.660> weird<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.460> his<00:03:00.460> face<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:02.170> actually

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
little weird but his face just actually

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.790 
little weird but his face just actually
by<00:03:02.770> looking<00:03:03.130> at<00:03:03.250> him<00:03:03.340> here<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.750> not<00:03:05.440> looking

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
by looking at him here and not looking

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.990 
by looking at him here and not looking
through<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.040> camera<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.610> looking<00:03:06.910> at

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
through the camera but just looking at

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
through the camera but just looking at
him<00:03:07.120> right<00:03:07.150> now<00:03:07.510> through<00:03:08.500> my<00:03:08.590> own<00:03:08.740> eyes<00:03:08.950> his

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
him right now through my own eyes his

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.070 
him right now through my own eyes his
face<00:03:09.520> is<00:03:09.700> actually<00:03:09.970> pretty<00:03:10.120> pretty<00:03:10.300> small<00:03:10.750> I

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
face is actually pretty pretty small I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.640 
face is actually pretty pretty small I
think<00:03:12.010> my<00:03:12.310> camera<00:03:12.550> kind<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.230> magnifies<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.290> I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
think my camera kind of magnifies it I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.110 
think my camera kind of magnifies it I
think<00:03:14.950> my<00:03:15.040> old<00:03:15.250> camera<00:03:15.460> did<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.820> as<00:03:15.910> well<00:03:15.940> I'm

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
think my old camera did that as well I'm

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.699 
think my old camera did that as well I'm
not<00:03:16.240> sure<00:03:16.300> really<00:03:16.480> sure<00:03:16.570> about<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.590> then

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
not sure really sure about that and then

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.170 
not sure really sure about that and then

could be a smokestack oh yes and then if

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.770 
could be a smokestack oh yes and then if
we<00:03:50.920> turn<00:03:51.130> around<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:52.420> see<00:03:52.630> his<00:03:52.750> cab<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.050> stuff

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
and so that's pretty much Wilbert um

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.740 
and so that's pretty much Wilbert um
let's<00:03:59.830> see<00:04:00.370> I'm<00:04:00.640> trying<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.090> think<00:04:01.600> of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
let's see I'm trying to think of

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
when I put it down or something so put

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.460 
when I put it down or something so put
them<00:04:26.980> around<00:04:27.070> here<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.730> then<00:04:27.820> zooming<00:04:28.150> in

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470

series so that's pretty good and one

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.140 
series so that's pretty good and one
thing<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.950> do<00:04:54.010> like<00:04:54.190> about<00:04:54.250> Wilbert<00:04:54.760> though<00:04:54.910> as

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
thing I do like about Wilbert though as

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.500 
thing I do like about Wilbert though as
I<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.660> red<00:04:55.990> stripe<00:04:56.620> at<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.300> front<00:04:58.300> here

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510

series<00:05:28.450> started<00:05:28.750> in<00:05:28.840> June<00:05:29.140> so<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.919> really

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
series started in June so I really

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.950 
series started in June so I really
didn't<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.460> Wilbert<00:05:31.060> for<00:05:31.390> that<00:05:31.510> long<00:05:31.780> before

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
didn't have Wilbert for that long before

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.750 
didn't have Wilbert for that long before
I<00:05:32.140> start<00:05:32.350> my<00:05:32.470> series<00:05:32.740> but<00:05:32.919> he<00:05:33.340> has<00:05:33.460> stayed<00:05:33.640> at

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
I start my series but he has stayed at

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.640 
I start my series but he has stayed at
an<00:05:33.850> incredible<00:05:34.360> condition<00:05:34.540> I<00:05:34.990> mean<00:05:35.470> there's

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
an incredible condition I mean there's

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.190 
an incredible condition I mean there's
not<00:05:35.770> really<00:05:36.040> a<00:05:36.160> scratch<00:05:36.460> on<00:05:36.669> bottom<00:05:37.360> maybe

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
that's just because I've kept really

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.040 
that's just because I've kept really
good<00:05:39.880> care<00:05:40.120> of<00:05:40.150> him<00:05:40.360> or<00:05:40.479> something<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:40.900> oh
