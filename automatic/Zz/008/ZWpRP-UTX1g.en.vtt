00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.280 
brilliant it was absolutely brilliant
like<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.210> said<00:02:59.390> there<00:02:59.540> at<00:02:59.690> him<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.020> took<00:03:00.140> us

uncommon<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.220> suppose<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.270> goes<00:03:02.390> to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
uncommon but I suppose it just goes to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.940 
uncommon but I suppose it just goes to
show<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:02.840> hard<00:03:03.050> work<00:03:03.110> does<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.620> know<00:03:03.770> we

what's<00:06:34.620> been<00:06:34.800> my<00:06:35.010> strong<00:06:35.220> point<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:35.580> far<00:06:35.790> as

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
what's been my strong point so far as

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.010 
what's been my strong point so far as
being<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.090> characters<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:36.510> think<00:06:36.780> we've<00:06:36.900> done

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
being the characters I think we've done
