00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.009
 it's time friends and welcome 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.080
 on facebook cooking so today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.059
 we meet for a Wednesday a little 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.519
 little special since it will have a recipe 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 that of the small bayonne and at mcdo and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.700
 some important announcements to watch 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.520
 after the recipe 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.670
 so look at you right after he 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 we will need mayonnaise honey 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 what you see there is everything 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.980
 just an ear which gave me the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 smoked taste to be able to find in 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.179
 some in some grocery stores that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 it's called smoked or smoked taste and what 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.030
 it's very important to have that for 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
 time these bumps you will need 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.410
 also a steak a net loss of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 bread cheddar goes hangover too a good 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 obviously and some leaves of 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 salad 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.920
 then the most important as usual 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 we start with sauce or boutali 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.350
 put a little smoked taste spices 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.420
 in mayonnaise not too much seen that it's 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.520
 loud enough and you're really going 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 add a touch of honey 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.760
 it's just to bring a little taste 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.260
 sweet sauce was not even a 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.820
 not even half a teaspoon 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.530
 it's really just a little drop 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 who gave a sweet taste and there 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.159
 to give you a good mix 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.049
 here is the sauce is ready we will be able 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.500
 immediately go to cooking the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.520
 steak 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.259
 we start by cooking the steak 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.119
 how much these areas and with salt and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.189
 pepper 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.479
 we then come to make the bread cough 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.150
 baguette and to finish we put the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 test ines of cheddar and we will go to 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.780
 training we will start by putting 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.119
 the sauce on both sides of the bread on 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 comes next placed on the bottom bread 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 the steak with the cheddar athlete on 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 add the leaves of his harbor and we 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.290
 just close the bagel go the friends 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.259
 it's gone for the tasting 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.299
 so we have a very nice bagel with the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.159
 cheese that is sinking it gives 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.729
 really want to go 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.159
 at the level of taste what I liked 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.130
 is that ben the sauce is very good on 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.069
 found the small cushion not known to create 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.869
 both smoked from mcdo's sauce 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.690
 on the other hand the bread I admit that it was 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.069
 not the same as bread from mc do in 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.440
 anyway this is the only point a 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.819
 little bit negative that we can we can 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.200
 blame it because it's a little bit more 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.280
 big so that's it if you have the time 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.140
 to make homemade bread 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.090
 I guarantee you it will be better 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.459
 So here you have no excuse 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.049
 to make this little bagel at home 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.790
 always goes well after the shots a 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.500
 little 4 hours like that where after a 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.660
 good part of plain it makes you a 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.769
 little thing to eat is nice and then 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.209
 if you do, do not hesitate to 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.370
 send me the pictures as usual 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.349

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.329
 hashtag face of a kitchen and for them 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.379
 announcements already firstly what 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.180
 about the contest 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.000
 and yes because I did a contest 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.739
 here is the low video posted here you 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.690
 you will be able to register it remains 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.760
 still a few days before it's 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.769
 finished and why I was talking to you about it 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.660
 simply why because there is 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.700
 a person on youtube who gets 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.459
 pass for me and who send you 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.030
 private messages by sending you click 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.069
 on a link 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.380
 it's mostly advertising does not do it 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.880
 do not click I posted at the earliest 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.859
 the channel thanks to all the people who 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.630
 helped me on facebook to report 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.190
 quickly the chain so here I do not 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.470
 will never ask you to click on 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.090
 links or especially not if this 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.889
 last ad in fact so 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.299
 you do not worry next 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.370
 time I will try to really be very 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.810
 very clear like that there will be no 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.430
 support which jean has it so here I know 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.930
 not who did that in any case that's it 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.299
 it did not matter to him 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.639
 did not answer the messages and then that's it 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.330
 I did not want to apologize for this little 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.250
 problem there that I will settle 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.840
 finding a solution for 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.590
 upcoming competitions and as you the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.570
 maybe know 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.730
