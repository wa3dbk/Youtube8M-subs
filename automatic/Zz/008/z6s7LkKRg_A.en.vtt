00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.800
 hello today on our review 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.800
 clamp meter uni-t ut m12 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.550
 pincers come in such a bag 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:34.329
 there is a handle for carrying inside we can 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 see the following clamp meter 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.780
 pincers 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.770
 strap gauges 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.960
 instruction in Russian and English 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:52.030
 languages ​​with the help sees and here is m 1203 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.160
 can measure constant variables 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.010
 voltage resistance frequency 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.990
 direct and alternating current up to 400 amperes 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.200
 another function is also present 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.940
 continuity and diode checking 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.070
 consider yourself ticks 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.759
 the device is quite compact maximum 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.200
 diameter 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:13.079
 measured conductor 26 elements 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.340
 made of high quality plastic 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.659
 we have placed on the front panel 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.640
 governing bodies 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.549
 display connectors 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.149
 measuring probes on the bottom 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.859
 strap bracket on the back panel 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.659
 battery compartment applied 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.659
 9 volt krone battery 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.340
 briefly about the functionality of the device 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.550
 using the threat 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.630
 using the sleep button and in measurement mode 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.680
 voltage can be switched between 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 DC and AC using 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.930
 raw buttons can be manually switched 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 measuring range so as default 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.250
 manually switching ranges also in 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 manual resistance measurement mode 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.050
 using the realke button, you can switch 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.090
 range mode forgot and about calls and 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.870
 check diodes using the tip button 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.520
 you can switch between the same 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.490
 measuring feels its duty ratio 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.670
 in this mode switching between 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 functions performed using ural 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.750
 current measurement two ranges available 40 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.430
 take 405 switches they manually select 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.450
 kind of current is carried out using 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.770
 select buttons and here the button is responsible for 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.920
 relative measurement mode 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.760
 This function is very necessary when measuring 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.220
 D.C. 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.550
 Well, there is also a function button 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.560
 I will give deduction and now we will demonstrate 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.560
 AC current privacy 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.910
 translate the rotor in the mode of current measurement 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:57.200
 we select measurements of alternating current 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:00.230
 squeeze all at once and 40 operas can 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.050
 press the button below and record the result 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:09.370
 we tighten butts 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:12.790
 crimp the second conductor 27 amps and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.200
 conductor 3 e46 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.050
 it is possible to measure from eg 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.350
 40 range 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.410
 go over the variable and then there will be 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.950
 the sound will be heard from the bieber and on 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.770
 the display shows the corners that is 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.800
 overrun is now measurable 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.880
 linear and phase voltages 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.810
 we connect probes we turn on the measurement mode 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:50.190
 voltage turn on the switch 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:58.440
 let's first about 400 3 volts 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:04:00.120
 or phase 236 uni-t ut m 1203 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.550
 Great choice for lovers and 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.790
 professionals thanks to the low 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.610
 the cost of a wide functional good 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.530
 workmanship besides mites 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.390
 made to the State Register of Ukraine and 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.390
 subject to metrological verification
