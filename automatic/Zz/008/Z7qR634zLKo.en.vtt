another really cool feature with the
Microsoft<00:01:00.740> Kinect<00:01:01.160> is<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.910> sea<00:01:02.120> at<00:01:02.270> say<00:01:02.450> it

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
Microsoft Kinect is the sea at say it

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.660 
Microsoft Kinect is the sea at say it
functionality<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:04.010> literally<00:01:04.309> going<00:01:04.550> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
functionality this is literally going to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.940 
functionality this is literally going to
let<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:04.970> say<00:01:05.239> any<00:01:05.510> command<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.440> see<00:01:06.650> up<00:01:06.800> on

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
let you say any command you see up on

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.580 
let you say any command you see up on
the<00:01:07.070> screen<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.520> execute<00:01:08.120> it<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.330> game<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.440> this

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
the screen to execute it in game so this

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.650 
the screen to execute it in game so this
time<00:01:09.770> instead<00:01:10.010> of<00:01:10.190> using<00:01:10.310> my<00:01:10.550> hands<00:01:11.060> I'm
