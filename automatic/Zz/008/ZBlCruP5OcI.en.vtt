ninety eight year old piano as you can

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.030 
ninety eight year old piano as you can
see<00:02:01.720> on<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.050> strings<00:02:02.410> there's<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.860> certain

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
see on the strings there's a certain

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.130 
see on the strings there's a certain
amount<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.400> rest<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.820> oxidation<00:02:04.330> that's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
amount of rest and oxidation that's

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.390 
amount of rest and oxidation that's
going<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.500> weaken<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.860> structure<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.310> the

going to weaken the structure of the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.060 
going to weaken the structure of the
string<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.660> would<00:02:08.110> not<00:02:08.320> be<00:02:08.590> quite<00:02:09.009> as

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
string so I would not be quite as

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.479 
string so I would not be quite as
aggressive<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.119> as<00:02:10.360> I
