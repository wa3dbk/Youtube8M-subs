00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.219
 here to the crafting table and then 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.119
 you need three diamonds and three 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.530
 Iron for this budget and then 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:15.890
 you also need for gold blocks the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.890

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.080
 the net reactors 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.400
 So I go outside 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.920
 and can be placed next to any place 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.960
 build and need a few more now 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.100
 paving stones and then you build that 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:19.480
 just follows takes only times 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:21.340
 five paving stones and arrange it so 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.120
 then 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 come again 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:32.460

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.460
 the corner 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.959
 then the budget in the middle and then 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.959
 you have to 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.329
 to the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:50.660
 touch a very nice have the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:52.310
 c14 pit metz killed and what then what 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.930

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:08.750
 slightly stone dust wooden door 13 euro so 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.510
 two mushrooms that 4 2 million saw yes 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.319
 then after you just killed the things 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.220

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:22.430

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.350
 holes of obsidian keatings in here 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.229
 and then the normal world holds 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.600
 just where you built it so 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.389
 the composer jÃ¼rgen over the at the 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.510
 computer version into the net but there 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.660

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.360
 shit made 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.810
 that's why the thing was built and 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.870
 all over that is struggling the whole 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.569
 Search with the gold and look for diamonds 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.919
 because the gold blocks we need there 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:01.499
 Buy gold after three diamonds need 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.949

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:08.699
 World destroyed if we have one now 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:14.399
 Ugly obsidian thing I have 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:16.949

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:25.429
