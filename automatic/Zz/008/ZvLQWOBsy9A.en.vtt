in a little bit and we're going to
adjust<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.770> saturation<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.700> point<00:01:36.970> where

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
adjust the saturation to the point where

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.820 
adjust the saturation to the point where
I<00:01:37.150> want<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.810> hair<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.229> where<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.409> want<00:01:38.680> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
anything else so let's just worry about

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.800 
anything else so let's just worry about
kind<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.670> areas<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:42.970> we<00:01:43.090> want<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.450> increase

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
kind of areas that we want to increase

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.420 
kind of areas that we want to increase
the<00:01:43.960> saturation<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:44.830> add<00:01:45.760> about<00:01:47.430> we'll

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
the saturation on and add about we'll

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.940 
the saturation on and add about we'll
say<00:01:48.610> at<00:01:48.760> about<00:01:48.850> 25<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:49.810> get<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> nice<00:01:50.380> red<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
say at about 25 I get a nice red in the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.789 
say at about 25 I get a nice red in the
lips<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:52.000> get<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.270> nice<00:01:52.570> golden<00:01:53.020> glow<00:01:53.229> in<00:01:53.500> the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
lips and I get a nice golden glow in the

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.620 
lips and I get a nice golden glow in the
hair<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.610> really<00:01:54.940> like<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.240> look<00:01:55.479> right

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
hair and I really like that look right

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.600 
hair and I really like that look right
there<00:01:55.690> if<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.560> want<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.860> enhance<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.250> lips<00:01:57.490> even

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
there if I want to enhance the lips even

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.160 
there if I want to enhance the lips even
further<00:01:57.909> darkening<00:01:58.479> whatever<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.810> can<00:01:59.020> add<00:01:59.140> a

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
further darkening whatever I can add a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.109 
further darkening whatever I can add a
hue/saturation<00:01:59.440> layer<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.369> pump<00:02:00.909> them<00:02:01.030> up

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
hue/saturation layer and pump them up

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.370 
hue/saturation layer and pump them up
but<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.360> think<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.750> good<00:02:01.900> where<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.200> at

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
but I think this is good where it's at

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.859 
but I think this is good where it's at
now<00:02:02.650> with<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> mask<00:02:03.970> selected<00:02:04.450> I'm<00:02:04.570> gonna<00:02:04.720> hit

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
now with the mask selected I'm gonna hit

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.990 
now with the mask selected I'm gonna hit
ctrl<00:02:05.260> +<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.740> or<00:02:05.770> command<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.340> had<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.490> Mac<00:02:06.729> and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
ctrl + I or command I had a Mac and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.969 
ctrl + I or command I had a Mac and
we're<00:02:07.810> gonna<00:02:07.900> start<00:02:08.170> painting<00:02:08.409> in<00:02:08.649> where<00:02:08.890> we

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
we're gonna start painting in where we

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.649 
we're gonna start painting in where we
actually<00:02:09.129> want<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.610> reveal<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.390> color

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
actually want to reveal this color

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.780 
actually want to reveal this color
enhancement<00:02:11.200> all<00:02:12.099> right<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.370> let's<00:02:12.519> invert

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
enhancement all right so let's invert

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.680 
enhancement all right so let's invert
our<00:02:12.940> color<00:02:13.120> by<00:02:13.360> hitting<00:02:13.540> X

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
our color by hitting X

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.030 
our color by hitting X
I'm<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.050> increase<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.320> brush<00:02:15.590> size<00:02:15.650> of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I'm going to increase the brush size of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.530 
I'm going to increase the brush size of
my<00:02:16.130> bracketing<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.850> we're<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.210> going<00:02:17.390> to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
my bracketing and we're just going to

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.990 
my bracketing and we're just going to
paint<00:02:17.780> over<00:02:17.990> make<00:02:18.410> sure<00:02:18.560> all<00:02:18.860> my<00:02:19.130> opacity<00:02:19.520> flow

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
paint over make sure all my opacity flow

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.600 
paint over make sure all my opacity flow
is<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.240> normal<00:02:20.570> or<00:02:21.380> on<00:02:21.620> 100%<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.340> we're<00:02:22.430> going

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
is on normal or on 100% and we're going

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.600 
is on normal or on 100% and we're going
to<00:02:22.670> paint<00:02:22.880> over<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.360> hair<00:02:23.750> layer<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.410> add<00:02:25.220> back

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
to paint over the hair layer to add back

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.490 
to paint over the hair layer to add back
in<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.060> color<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:26.990> see<00:02:27.170> how<00:02:27.320> it's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
in that color and you can see how it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.920 
in that color and you can see how it's
just<00:02:27.560> kind<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.860> making<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> hair<00:02:28.430> pop<00:02:28.840> want<00:02:29.840> to

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
just kind of making the hair pop want to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.480 
just kind of making the hair pop want to
be<00:02:30.020> careful<00:02:30.350> not<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.530> cover<00:02:30.770> any<00:02:31.010> areas<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
be careful not to cover any areas of the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.030 
be careful not to cover any areas of the
skin<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.230> particular<00:02:33.230> areas<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.770> skin

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
skin in particular areas of the skin

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.350 
skin in particular areas of the skin
that<00:02:34.070> have<00:02:34.310> shadows<00:02:34.580> because<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.180> going<00:02:35.270> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
that have shadows because it's going to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.260 
that have shadows because it's going to
be<00:02:35.450> even<00:02:35.630> more<00:02:35.900> noticeable<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.640> colors

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
be even more noticeable that the colors

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.780 
be even more noticeable that the colors
have<00:02:38.390> been<00:02:38.420> kind<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.870> crazed<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:40.040> I'd<00:02:40.220> over

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
have been kind of crazed if I'd over

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.580 
have been kind of crazed if I'd over
those<00:02:40.940> areas<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.780> let's<00:02:41.990> just<00:02:42.170> make<00:02:42.320> sure<00:02:42.350> we

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
those areas so let's just make sure we

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.430 
those areas so let's just make sure we
hit<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:42.950> hair<00:02:43.310> only<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.930> just<00:02:44.990> kind<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.320> be

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
hit the hair only and just kind of be

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.200 
hit the hair only and just kind of be
careful<00:02:45.650> as<00:02:45.920> we're<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.220> over<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.640> again<00:02:47.000> you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
careful as we're going over it again you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.640 
careful as we're going over it again you
can<00:02:47.270> hit<00:02:47.450> backslash<00:02:47.960> if<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.200> want<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.410> see<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
can hit backslash if you want to see the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.600 
can hit backslash if you want to see the
mask<00:02:48.860> while<00:02:49.070> you're<00:02:49.220> painting<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.580> in<00:02:51.610> we're

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
mask while you're painting it in we're

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.860 
mask while you're painting it in we're
fine<00:02:52.850> with<00:02:53.000> getting<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.330> close<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.780> what

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
fine with getting it close and what

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.450 
fine with getting it close and what
we'll<00:02:53.990> do<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.290> kind<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.620> tweak<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.250> edge

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
we'll do is just kind of tweak that edge

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.800 
we'll do is just kind of tweak that edge
of<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.700> skin<00:02:55.940> just<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.240> make<00:02:56.390> sure<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.660> not

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
of the skin just to make sure it's not

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.570 
of the skin just to make sure it's not
covering<00:02:57.080> any<00:02:57.200> skin<00:02:58.090> let's<00:02:59.090> kind<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.580> accent

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
covering any skin let's kind of accent

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.920 
covering any skin let's kind of accent
paint<00:03:01.790> out<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.180> area<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.690> then<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:02.900> just

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
paint out this area and then we're just

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.410 
paint out this area and then we're just
going<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.170> paint<00:03:03.410> out<00:03:03.680> we're<00:03:03.890> gonna<00:03:03.980> zoom<00:03:04.190> in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
going to paint out we're gonna zoom in

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.740 
going to paint out we're gonna zoom in
just<00:03:05.420> paint<00:03:05.720> out<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.840> areas<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:07.750> skin

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
just paint out the areas of the skin

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.190 
just paint out the areas of the skin
where<00:03:08.900> we<00:03:08.960> don't<00:03:09.200> want<00:03:09.380> these<00:03:09.530> adjustments

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
where we don't want these adjustments

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.080 
where we don't want these adjustments
it's<00:03:12.200> important<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.710> it's<00:03:13.400> okay<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
it's important that it's okay if the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.330 
it's important that it's okay if the
hair<00:03:14.450> fades<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.050> little<00:03:15.500> bit<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.680> color<00:03:15.950> when<00:03:16.250> it

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
hair fades a little bit in color when it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.670 
hair fades a little bit in color when it
gets<00:03:16.490> close<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.820> skin<00:03:17.120> that's<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.410> less

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
gets close to the skin that's a less

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.350 
gets close to the skin that's a less
important<00:03:19.130> than<00:03:19.190> I've<00:03:19.670> been<00:03:19.790> making<00:03:19.970> sure<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
important than I've been making sure the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.390 
important than I've been making sure the
skin<00:03:20.630> doesn't<00:03:20.840> change<00:03:21.170> colors<00:03:21.650> because

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
skin doesn't change colors because

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.380 
skin doesn't change colors because
that's<00:03:22.610> going<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.790> be<00:03:22.850> really<00:03:23.300> really

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
that's going to be really really

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.880 
that's going to be really really
noticeable<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.200> be<00:03:24.350> really<00:03:24.560> careful<00:03:24.590> about

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
noticeable so be really careful about

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.930 
noticeable so be really careful about
that<00:03:26.050> okay<00:03:27.050> I<00:03:27.260> think<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.280> looks<00:03:28.580> pretty<00:03:28.820> good

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
that okay I think that looks pretty good

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.800 
that okay I think that looks pretty good
where<00:03:29.209> it's<00:03:29.330> at<00:03:29.510> we're<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:31.540> mask<00:03:32.540> out

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
where it's at we're going to mask out

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.360 
where it's at we're going to mask out
the<00:03:32.840> lips<00:03:33.230> because<00:03:33.560> we<00:03:33.680> don't<00:03:33.860> want<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.160> lips

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
the lips because we don't want the lips

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.330 
the lips because we don't want the lips
to<00:03:34.550> be<00:03:34.630> or<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:35.750> do<00:03:35.900> want<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.170> lips<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.410> actually

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
to be or we do want the lips to actually

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.770 
to be or we do want the lips to actually
have<00:03:37.489> boosted<00:03:38.000> colors<00:03:39.280> again<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:41.660> can

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
have boosted colors again we can you can

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.180 
have boosted colors again we can you can
make<00:03:41.930> your<00:03:42.080> life<00:03:42.230> easier<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.800> actually<00:03:42.920> just

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
make your life easier and actually just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.500 
make your life easier and actually just
switch<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.610> hardness<00:03:43.970> right<00:03:44.180> now<00:03:44.330> while

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
switch the hardness right now while

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.729 
switch the hardness right now while
you're<00:03:44.630> doing<00:03:44.690> this<00:03:44.959> or<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.440> could<00:03:45.560> be<00:03:45.709> like

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
you're doing this or you could be like

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.890 
you're doing this or you could be like
me<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.220> paint<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.030> then<00:03:47.120> retouch<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.660> a

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
me and paint it in and then retouch it a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.500 
me and paint it in and then retouch it a
second<00:03:48.500> later<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.950> I'm<00:03:49.820> going<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.150> now<00:03:50.450> switch

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
second later so I'm going to now switch

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.970 
second later so I'm going to now switch
the<00:03:50.840> hardness<00:03:51.200> up<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.440> little<00:03:51.620> bit<00:03:51.739> higher

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the hardness up a little bit higher

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.460 
the hardness up a little bit higher
we're<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.239> switch<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.480> black<00:03:53.870> we're

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
we're going to switch to black we're

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.020 
we're going to switch to black we're
gonna<00:03:54.620> paint<00:03:54.890> back<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.400> over<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:55.790> edge

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
gonna paint back just over that edge

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.160 
gonna paint back just over that edge
where<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.450> don't<00:03:56.750> want<00:03:57.220> the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
where I don't want the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.480 
where I don't want the
saturation<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.409> appear

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.220 

by<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.090> way<00:04:05.240> again<00:04:05.540> if<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.900> Wacom

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
by the way again if you have a Wacom

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.470 
by the way again if you have a Wacom
tablet<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:07.220> really<00:04:07.490> pays<00:04:07.640> off<00:04:07.820> in<00:04:08.000> situations

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
tablet it really pays off in situations

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.600 
tablet it really pays off in situations
like<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.780> I'm<00:04:09.080> still<00:04:09.260> using<00:04:09.470> my<00:04:09.830> mouse

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
like this I'm still using my mouse

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.190 
like this I'm still using my mouse
because<00:04:10.970> my<00:04:11.120> tablet<00:04:11.330> is<00:04:11.600> actually<00:04:11.780> in<00:04:12.110> the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
because my tablet is actually in the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.740 
because my tablet is actually in the
office<00:04:12.350> right<00:04:12.710> now<00:04:13.420> all<00:04:14.420> right

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
office right now all right

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.420 
office right now all right
if<00:04:14.990> it<00:04:15.140> backs<00:04:15.380> laughs<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.770> see<00:04:15.920> where<00:04:16.100> we<00:04:16.220> what

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
if it backs laughs to see where we what

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.120 
if it backs laughs to see where we what
we<00:04:16.550> got<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:16.940> far<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:18.260> looks<00:04:18.560> about<00:04:18.710> right<00:04:18.860> I

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
we got so far that looks about right I

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.650 
we got so far that looks about right I
don't<00:04:19.370> see<00:04:19.640> only<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.970> zoom<00:04:20.120> in<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:20.330> don't<00:04:20.510> see

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
don't see only to zoom in I don't see

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.740 
don't see only to zoom in I don't see
any<00:04:20.810> areas<00:04:21.050> of<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.380> skin<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.860> look<00:04:22.750> strange

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
any areas of the skin that look strange

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.450 
any areas of the skin that look strange
let<00:04:24.170> me<00:04:24.230> just<00:04:24.410> make<00:04:24.560> sure<00:04:24.620> I'm<00:04:24.980> gonna<00:04:25.130> paint

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
let me just make sure I'm gonna paint

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.520 
let me just make sure I'm gonna paint
over<00:04:25.580> this<00:04:25.850> area<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:27.050> make<00:04:27.200> sure<00:04:27.320> none<00:04:27.500> of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
over this area just to make sure none of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.830 
over this area just to make sure none of
that<00:04:27.650> area<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:28.010> covered<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:29.350> think<00:04:30.350> we're<00:04:30.770> good

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
that area is covered I think we're good

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.530 
that area is covered I think we're good
all<00:04:32.840> right<00:04:33.040> now<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.820> is<00:04:34.880> where<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.210> would<00:04:35.300> say

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
all right now this is where I would say

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.150 
all right now this is where I would say
if<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:35.930> want<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.590> make<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.980> eyes<00:04:37.010> more

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
if you want you can make the eyes more

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.940 
if you want you can make the eyes more
saturated<00:04:37.880> otherwise<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:39.080> know<00:04:39.170> it's<00:04:39.740> really

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
saturated otherwise you know it's really

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.880 
saturated otherwise you know it's really
up<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.400> but<00:04:41.170> let's<00:04:42.170> just<00:04:42.290> do<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.500> just<00:04:42.710> for

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
up to you but let's just do it just for

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.410 
up to you but let's just do it just for
the<00:04:42.950> sake<00:04:43.100> of<00:04:43.160> doing<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.550> we'll<00:04:43.790> paint<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
the sake of doing it we'll paint in the

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.750 
the sake of doing it we'll paint in the
eyes<00:04:44.600> just<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.290> we<00:04:46.160> have<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.370> little<00:04:46.610> more

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
eyes just so we have a little more

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.970 
eyes just so we have a little more
saturation<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.510> eyes<00:04:47.770> what<00:04:48.770> we're<00:04:48.890> gonna

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
saturation in the eyes what we're gonna

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.500 
saturation in the eyes what we're gonna
do<00:04:49.220> now<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.430> we're<00:04:49.760> going<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:49.940> do<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.060> reverse

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
do now is we're going to do a reverse

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.000 
do now is we're going to do a reverse
saturation<00:04:51.170> which<00:04:51.290> is<00:04:51.350> going<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.530> pull<00:04:51.770> out<00:04:51.980> a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
saturation which is going to pull out a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.590 
saturation which is going to pull out a
lot<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.520> saturation<00:04:52.850> in<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.030> image<00:04:53.330> and

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
lot of the saturation in the image and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.690 
lot of the saturation in the image and
then<00:04:54.470> we're<00:04:54.740> gonna<00:04:54.830> add<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.100> little<00:04:55.400> bit<00:04:55.520> back

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
then we're gonna add a little bit back

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.430 
then we're gonna add a little bit back
in<00:04:55.910> I'm<00:04:56.090> holding<00:04:56.450> alt<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.960> clicking<00:04:57.170> on<00:04:57.320> the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
in I'm holding alt and clicking on the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.780 
in I'm holding alt and clicking on the
mask<00:04:57.680> just<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.980> bring<00:04:58.130> up<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.340> master<00:04:58.670> so<00:04:58.760> I

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
mask just to bring up the master so I

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.030 
mask just to bring up the master so I
can<00:04:58.910> kind<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.150> clean<00:04:59.450> up<00:04:59.480> any<00:05:00.290> splotchiness

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
can kind of clean up any splotchiness

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.470 
can kind of clean up any splotchiness
that<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.310> have<00:05:01.550> like<00:05:01.760> in<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:01.970> hair<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.300> stuff

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
that I have like in the hair and stuff

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.360 
that I have like in the hair and stuff
like<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:02.720> which<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.110> see<00:05:03.350> by<00:05:04.190> those

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
like that which you can see by those

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.940 
like that which you can see by those
spots<00:05:04.700> all<00:05:05.630> right<00:05:05.720> I'm<00:05:06.140> gonna<00:05:06.260> hit<00:05:06.410> zero<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.830> go

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
spots all right I'm gonna hit zero to go

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.370 
spots all right I'm gonna hit zero to go
back<00:05:07.100> to<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.340> full<00:05:07.670> screen<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:09.230> we're

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
back to you a full screen and now we're

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.230 
back to you a full screen and now we're
gonna<00:05:09.500> add<00:05:09.680> one<00:05:10.130> more<00:05:10.340> vibrance<00:05:10.790> layer<00:05:10.850> and

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
gonna add one more vibrance layer and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.430 
gonna add one more vibrance layer and
this<00:05:11.330> time<00:05:11.570> we're<00:05:11.750> going<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.930> do<00:05:12.020> is<00:05:12.140> we're<00:05:12.320> do

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
this time we're going to do is we're do

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.290 
this time we're going to do is we're do
a<00:05:12.470> little<00:05:12.770> reverse<00:05:13.190> vibrance<00:05:13.910> reverse

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
a little reverse vibrance reverse

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.850 
a little reverse vibrance reverse
saturation<00:05:14.510> when<00:05:14.930> we<00:05:14.990> kind<00:05:15.170> of<00:05:15.260> pull<00:05:15.500> out<00:05:15.650> some

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
saturation when we kind of pull out some

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.830 
saturation when we kind of pull out some
of<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:15.980> color<00:05:16.160> tones<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.670> enhance<00:05:17.060> some<00:05:17.810> of

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
of the color tones and enhance some of

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.690 
of the color tones and enhance some of
the<00:05:17.960> remaining<00:05:18.950> color<00:05:19.100> tones<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.460> that's<00:05:19.580> why

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
the remaining color tones and that's why

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.040 
the remaining color tones and that's why
we<00:05:19.790> created<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.270> first<00:05:20.600> vibrance<00:05:21.020> layer

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
we created this first vibrance layer

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.630 
we created this first vibrance layer
because<00:05:21.800> we<00:05:21.860> want<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.070> kind<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.220> make<00:05:22.430> those

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
because we want to kind of make those

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.940 
because we want to kind of make those
areas<00:05:23.030> that<00:05:23.060> want<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.450> pop<00:05:23.690> pop<00:05:24.410> first<00:05:24.650> and

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
areas that want to pop pop first and

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.230 
areas that want to pop pop first and
then<00:05:25.070> we're<00:05:25.160> gonna<00:05:25.250> pull<00:05:25.550> some<00:05:25.850> of<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:25.970> colors

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
then we're gonna pull some of the colors

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.300 
then we're gonna pull some of the colors
out<00:05:26.360> now<00:05:26.570> so<00:05:27.380> is<00:05:27.440> that<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.620> second<00:05:28.010> vibrance

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
out now so is that the second vibrance

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.010 
out now so is that the second vibrance
layer<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.760> this<00:05:29.300> layer<00:05:29.360> I'm<00:05:29.660> going<00:05:29.690> to<00:05:29.840> pull

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
layer and this layer I'm going to pull

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.350 
layer and this layer I'm going to pull
my<00:05:30.110> vibrance<00:05:30.470> down<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.800> say<00:05:31.010> negative<00:05:31.490> 15<00:05:32.150> just

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
my vibrance down to say negative 15 just

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.700 
my vibrance down to say negative 15 just
to<00:05:32.420> kind<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.660> mute<00:05:32.930> some<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.200> other<00:05:33.320> colors

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
to kind of mute some the other colors

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.140 
to kind of mute some the other colors
and<00:05:33.980> then<00:05:34.640> we're<00:05:34.730> going<00:05:34.850> to<00:05:34.880> bring<00:05:35.000> our

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
and then we're going to bring our

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.770 
and then we're going to bring our
saturation<00:05:35.720> up<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:36.170> around<00:05:36.590> lips<00:05:36.950> 810<00:05:37.780> that

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
saturation up to around lips 810 that

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.020 
saturation up to around lips 810 that
looks<00:05:38.930> about<00:05:39.110> right<00:05:39.350> where<00:05:39.560> it's<00:05:39.680> at<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.130> like

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
looks about right where it's at I like

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.610 
looks about right where it's at I like
to<00:05:41.210> look<00:05:41.300> about<00:05:41.510> it<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:41.840> guys<00:05:41.960> can<00:05:42.170> adjust<00:05:42.470> how

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
to look about it you guys can adjust how

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.710 
to look about it you guys can adjust how
you<00:05:42.650> guys<00:05:42.860> however<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.430> guys<00:05:43.520> want<00:05:43.850> if<00:05:44.150> you

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
guys feel like her eyes are too colorful

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520 
guys feel like her eyes are too colorful
right<00:05:46.610> now<00:05:46.760> like<00:05:46.910> they're<00:05:47.030> too<00:05:47.210> fiery

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
right now like they're too fiery

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.510 
right now like they're too fiery
whatever<00:05:48.530> that's<00:05:48.770> fine<00:05:48.950> just<00:05:48.980> go<00:05:49.310> back<00:05:49.490> to

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
whatever that's fine just go back to

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.990 
whatever that's fine just go back to
your<00:05:49.700> vibrance<00:05:50.060> layer<00:05:50.980> click<00:05:51.980> on<00:05:52.220> alt<00:05:52.610> on<00:05:52.910> the

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
your vibrance layer click on alt on the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.180 
your vibrance layer click on alt on the
mask<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.600> then<00:05:53.780> go<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.020> black<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.710> just<00:05:54.860> mask

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
mask and then go to black and just mask

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.730 
mask and then go to black and just mask
it<00:05:55.370> back<00:05:55.490> out<00:05:55.700> you<00:05:56.450> know<00:05:56.540> this<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:56.840> really<00:05:57.560> up

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
it back out you know this is really up

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.350 
it back out you know this is really up
to<00:05:57.920> you<00:05:58.010> guys<00:05:58.100> how<00:05:58.550> you<00:05:58.610> guys<00:05:58.820> want<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.150> look

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
to you guys how you guys want to look

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.570 
to you guys how you guys want to look
with<00:06:00.080> eyes<00:06:00.380> there's<00:06:00.710> obviously<00:06:01.220> a<00:06:01.280> point

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
with eyes there's obviously a point

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.070 
with eyes there's obviously a point
where<00:06:01.700> you<00:06:01.760> can<00:06:01.850> go<00:06:01.970> too<00:06:02.030> far<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.720> it's<00:06:02.870> easy

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
where you can go too far and it's easy

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.080 
where you can go too far and it's easy
to<00:06:03.230> go<00:06:03.320> too<00:06:03.380> far<00:06:03.710> but<00:06:04.400> there's<00:06:04.550> also<00:06:04.700> a<00:06:04.820> point

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
to go too far but there's also a point

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.610 
to go too far but there's also a point
where<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.420> looks<00:06:05.450> good<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.110> it's<00:06:06.260> just<00:06:06.380> really

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
where it looks good and it's just really

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.500 
where it looks good and it's just really
about<00:06:06.770> your<00:06:07.040> preference<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.700> you'll<00:06:08.300> notice

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
about your preference and you'll notice

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.150 
about your preference and you'll notice
that<00:06:08.600> in<00:06:08.930> a<00:06:09.020> lot<00:06:09.320> of<00:06:09.470> magazines<00:06:09.650> especially

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
that in a lot of magazines especially

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.280 
that in a lot of magazines especially
fashion<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.120> stuff<00:06:11.240> like<00:06:11.390> that<00:06:11.540> they

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
fashion and stuff like that they

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.990 
fashion and stuff like that they
actually<00:06:12.590> go<00:06:12.680> pretty<00:06:12.710> gnarly<00:06:13.340> on<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.640> eyes<00:06:13.760> if

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
actually go pretty gnarly on the eyes if

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.340 
actually go pretty gnarly on the eyes if
you<00:06:14.090> look<00:06:14.210> really<00:06:14.390> closely<00:06:14.660> you<00:06:14.900> can<00:06:15.050> see<00:06:15.230> that

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
you look really closely you can see that

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.240 
you look really closely you can see that
the<00:06:15.440> eyes<00:06:15.560> are<00:06:15.740> pretty<00:06:15.800> crazy

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
the eyes are pretty crazy

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.790 
the eyes are pretty crazy
so<00:06:16.540> anyway<00:06:17.540> I<00:06:17.570> like<00:06:17.960> this<00:06:18.200> the<00:06:18.410> way<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:18.710> is

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
so anyway I like this the way it is
