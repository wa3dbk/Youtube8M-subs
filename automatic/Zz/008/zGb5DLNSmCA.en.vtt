so here's teleport base teleport so lets

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.769 
so here's teleport base teleport so lets
you<00:00:05.520> jump<00:00:05.730> around<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.299> know<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.629> very

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
you jump around you know it's very

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.509 
you jump around you know it's very
similar<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.319> d2<00:00:07.680> skill<00:00:07.950> very<00:00:08.160> useful<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
similar to the d2 skill very useful to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.660 
similar to the d2 skill very useful to
get<00:00:08.639> away<00:00:08.700> from<00:00:08.849> stuff<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.190> teleport

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
get away from stuff so this is teleport

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
was striking rune and essentially this

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.530 
was striking rune and essentially this
allows<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.950> damage<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.969> whatever<00:00:15.330> you

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
teleport near it actually turns teleport

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.849 
teleport near it actually turns teleport
into<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.390> offensive<00:00:18.840> skill<00:00:19.320> instead<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
into an offensive skill instead of a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
into an offensive skill instead of a
defensive<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.460> teleport<00:00:24.420> with

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
defensive one so and then teleport with

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.689 
defensive one so and then teleport with
we<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> third<00:00:25.289> teleport<00:00:25.800> yeah<00:00:26.279> multi

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
we have a third teleport yeah multi

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.240 
we have a third teleport yeah multi
strike<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.900> teleport<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.680> multi<00:00:28.949> strike

Burke after the teleporter you know
after<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> transporter<00:00:36.660> accident<00:00:36.809> kind<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
after the transporter accident kind of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
after the transporter accident kind of
that<00:00:37.590> idea<00:00:37.770> once<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> teleport<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.969> split

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that idea once you teleport you split

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
that idea once you teleport you split
into<00:00:39.660> images<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.260> yourself<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> those<00:00:40.920> images

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
into images of yourself and those images

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
into images of yourself and those images
are<00:00:41.520> illusions<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.120> distract<00:00:42.899> monsters<00:00:43.410> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
are illusions that distract monsters so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it's cool ways that you can kind of make

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.790 
it's cool ways that you can kind of make
teleport<00:00:45.899> act<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.350> differently<00:00:48.800> go

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
teleport act a little differently go

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.150 
teleport act a little differently go
ahead<00:00:50.010> does<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.510> there<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.530> Scola<00:00:52.890> flame

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
ahead does it there we go so Scola flame

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.410

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.069 

we<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.880> our<00:01:09.030> finger<00:01:09.359> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> pulse<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
we have our finger on the pulse of the

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.370 
we have our finger on the pulse of the
Diablo<00:01:10.590> audience<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> skull<00:01:12.570> play<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.049> multi

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Diablo audience so skull play with multi

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
Diablo audience so skull play with multi
strike<00:01:13.679> bounces<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:24.270> cool<00:01:24.479> thing<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.719> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
strike bounces and the cool thing is the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
strike bounces and the cool thing is the
further<00:01:25.289> away<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.649> throw<00:01:26.069> it<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.369> longer<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
further away you throw it the longer the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.940 
further away you throw it the longer the
bounce<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.539> it<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.899> has<00:01:28.140> cool<00:01:28.469> gameplay<00:01:28.709> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
bounce so it really has cool gameplay to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.609 
bounce so it really has cool gameplay to
it<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.909> power<00:01:30.179> rune<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.990> leaves<00:01:31.259> burning

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it so power rune actually leaves burning

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.919 
it so power rune actually leaves burning
areas<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> ground<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.810> have

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
areas on the ground that you can have

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.120 
areas on the ground that you can have
monsters<00:01:34.319> walk<00:01:34.530> through<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> take

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
monsters walk through and take

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
monsters walk through and take
additional<00:01:35.399> damage<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.349> system<00:01:40.739> really

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
additional damage so this system really

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.260 
additional damage so this system really
got<00:01:41.159> us<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.700> wanted<00:01:42.239> which<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:44.270> skill

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
got us what we wanted which was a skill

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
got us what we wanted which was a skill
looks<00:01:45.539> different<00:01:46.049> every<00:01:46.229> time<00:01:46.739> with<00:01:47.039> every

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
looks different every time with every

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.130 
looks different every time with every
player<00:01:47.549> who<00:01:47.909> uses<00:01:48.179> it<00:01:48.329> based<00:01:48.599> on<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.959> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
player who uses it based on what the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
player who uses it based on what the
players<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.709> out<00:01:50.069> of<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.340> skill<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.299> here

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
players like out of that skill so here

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.059 
players like out of that skill so here
we<00:01:51.569> have<00:01:51.599> basic<00:01:51.989> electrocute<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.920> kind

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
we have basic electrocute this is kind

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.649 
we have basic electrocute this is kind
of<00:01:53.099> the<00:01:53.189> last<00:01:53.310> skill<00:01:53.700> rune<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.179> we're<00:01:54.569> going

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
of the last skill rune that we're going

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.690 
of the last skill rune that we're going
to<00:01:54.750> show<00:01:54.989> so<00:01:55.619> basically<00:01:55.950> execute<00:01:56.429> you<00:01:56.610> know

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to show so basically execute you know

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.149 
to show so basically execute you know
it's<00:01:57.149> cool<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.229> electrocutes

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it's cool if you know electrocutes

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
it's cool if you know electrocutes
things<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.719> once<00:02:01.349> you<00:02:01.469> put<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.130> leave<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
things but once you put in a leave the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.889 
things but once you put in a leave the
first<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.780> multi<00:02:04.229> strike<00:02:05.539> this<00:02:06.539> really

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
first one is a multi strike this really

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.350 
first one is a multi strike this really
ups<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.829> Chain<00:02:08.160> Lightning<00:02:08.429> aspect<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
ups the the Chain Lightning aspect of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.630 
ups the the Chain Lightning aspect of
the<00:02:09.629> skill

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.370 

so<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> last<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> lethality<00:02:19.900> room

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so in the last is a lethality room
