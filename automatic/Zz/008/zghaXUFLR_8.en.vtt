00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello everyone who watches this video in this 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 video I want to present you my new 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 the knife that I made for the kitchen for cutting 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.859
 vegetables and fruits here is a new little knife 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.359
 which i made he made of 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 of stainless steel 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 blade of steel was taken from old 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.850
 broken soviet knife in general 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.180
 Soviet-made handle made 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.320
 walnut wood with inserts from 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.320
 cherry tree 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.219
 the blade was set on epoxy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 in the handle well, in general, glued 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:57.480
 epoxy to the handle in general here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.050
 such a design is so thick 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.050
 blades 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 somewhere if I'm not mistaken somewhere one and a half 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.799
 millimeter somewhere I specifically chose 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.500
 exactly thin blade so she is good 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.390
 was cutting 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 fruits and vegetables here I also managed to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.380
 such a thin blade as you see 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.979
 make a downhill 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.979
 so that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.040
 about the blade that the blade looked like its 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.130
 sort of like a straight razor to right 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.430
 well entered and fruit and very well 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.400
 cut so now about the grip 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.890
 handles the thing is i didn't want 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.480
 just an ordinary wooden handle 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.140
 and decided a little bit to decorate this grip 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.820
 adorned her with carving kind 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 carving such as braided with inserts 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.840
 from cherry 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 what flowers with leaves well, let me 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.979
 I will show you closer how you see such 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.930
 lever 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.470
 I didn't bother much, I didn't do super 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.930
 the job 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.520
 dressed so that the handle was less 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.420
 beautiful and pretty he as you see here 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.420
 so braided 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.650
 so here itself directly on the butt 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.650
 you see 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.739
 such is the design of the handle 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.329
 in the fact that these inserts 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:00.290
 I glued with epoxy resin, too, to 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.030
 they more or less held tightly of course 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.269
 there is no super fit 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.989
 Well, the knife was done not to the exhibition 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.829
 allotment 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.579
 got to the kitchen so it was nice to them 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.959
 work so well in hand pen well 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.180
 no pride lies no 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.790
 no stops specifically so you can 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.319
 it was good to quickly clean the apple 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.250
 potato and so on so what else 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.720
 wanted to say 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.189
 the handle is completely saturated with linseed oil and 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.599
 she left the handle for a day 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:41.389
 soak in the bed and because the knife 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.540
 will often deal with water well and to 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:47.169
 the tree is not out of the sail in general kind 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.440
 protection against moisture and water 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.599
 completely everything is soaked covered here 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.310
 such a knife 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:01.150
 Well, naturally legs sharpened like a razor 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:06.199
 Now I will show you this sharpening 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.780
 So well, the handle in general and the blade, I generally 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:11.840
 did a long time but somehow there was no time 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.900
 collect them and why not have time not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.150
 that time was not time 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.169
 but the knife was a little not ready because 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:25.909
 that the blade was not polished here I 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.669
 as you can see from polished blade polishing 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:31.190
 I do not do the perfect polishing 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.470
 did so that the blades were smooth 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.620
 and slippery to cut fruit well 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.340
 Well I handle where somewhere did three days 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.270
 slowly and blade on my blade 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.320
 It took one and a half days in total somewhere too 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.639
 between leisurely work 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.120
 I do my crafts 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:00.560
 and such a knife turned out such 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.870
 handle purely for vegetables for fruits 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.270
 the thing is, I almost have 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.069
 for fruits and for vegetables, all are 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.860
 knives with such descents 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.800
 like dangerous razors I've noticed 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.139
 how thin they are they are very good 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.990
 cuts fruits and vegetables with these 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.490
 descents like razors of course 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.370
 the edge is not super hard 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.650
 but for vegetables and fruits, this is not necessary 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.620
 we will not cut the meat 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.759
 you will not cut bones cleanly for 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.479
 vegetables for fruits 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:36.210
 even when he is stupid with such 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.020
 descents if he's dumb he doesn't care 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.379
 cuts fruits and vegetables so well let me 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.879
 show you the sharpness of this knife and 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:52.020
 I think the video will be finished so 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:54.259
 our knife and let's see how it is 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.259
 cuts 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.729
 in general, I made such a knife for 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.969
 kitchens 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:17.060

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.379
 very comfortable in the hand 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:28.529
 In general, I am completely satisfied with 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.719
 I have experience in making such 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.719
 knives 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:36.689
 it is for the kitchen knife configuration 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:39.439
 fully time tested more than once 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:42.680
 yourself seemed good side and 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:46.699
 I do not see any flaws in the construction 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.740
 in general, thank you for your attention 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:52.439
 in general, with one installation of this 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.719
 knife in general subscribe to the channel 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:57.469
