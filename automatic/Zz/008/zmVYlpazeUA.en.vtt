favorite bag is a milk bag because it's

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.960 
favorite bag is a milk bag because it's
a<00:00:13.860> very<00:00:14.070> durable<00:00:14.400> plastic<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.980> it<00:00:16.980> seals<00:00:17.310> real

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
a very durable plastic and it seals real

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.560 
a very durable plastic and it seals real
well<00:00:19.279> what<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> did<00:00:20.869> was<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.170> drilled<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.130> hole

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
well what I did was I drilled a hole

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.050 
well what I did was I drilled a hole
through<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> food<00:00:24.930> saver<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.939> course<00:00:26.939> you

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
through the food saver of course you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.089 
through the food saver of course you
have<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.359> take<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.689> food<00:00:27.869> saver<00:00:28.109> apart<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
have to take the food saver apart to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.970 
have to take the food saver apart to
know<00:00:29.220> where<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> drill<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> hole<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
know where to drill that hole so you

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
know where to drill that hole so you
don't<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.489> through<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> motherboard<00:00:33.329> or

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
don't go through the motherboard or

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.530 
don't go through the motherboard or
something<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> then<00:00:35.250> through<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.579> hole

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
something and then through that hole

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.250 
something and then through that hole
what<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.800> insert<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> 14<00:00:39.030> gauge<00:00:39.360> copper

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
what I do is I insert a 14 gauge copper

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:59.170 
what I do is I insert a 14 gauge copper
wire<00:00:43.910> which<00:00:44.910> goes<00:00:44.940> right<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.690> into<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.010> bag

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.020 

also<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.109> these<00:01:01.289> bags<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.219> cut

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
also what I do with these bags is I cut

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.479 
also what I do with these bags is I cut
off<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.300> slip<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:04.170> baits<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.159> lip

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
off the slip these baits have this lip

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.780 
off the slip these baits have this lip
here<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.380> both<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.619> outside<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.760> inside

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
here on both the outside and the inside

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.870 
here on both the outside and the inside
and<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.780> cut<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.580> because<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and I like to cut that off because I

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.810 
and I like to cut that off because I
have<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.570> failures<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.770> point<00:01:14.130> because

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
have had failures at that point because

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
have had failures at that point because
there's<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.090> too<00:01:15.360> much<00:01:15.509> plastic<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> seal

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
there's just too much plastic to seal

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.660 
there's just too much plastic to seal
there<00:01:23.600> today<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.840> am<00:01:25.110> sealing<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.159> cherry

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
there today I am sealing some cherry

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.240 
there today I am sealing some cherry
smoked<00:01:27.200> pork<00:01:28.200> ribs

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:45.550 

I'm<00:01:32.250> putting<00:01:32.670> three<00:01:32.939> pieces<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.900> each<00:01:34.770> bag

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:02:23.440 

go<00:01:46.560> through<00:01:46.829> here

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:32.140 

I<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.290> run<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> second<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.970> make

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
I like to run a second on just to make

00:02:32.150 --> 00:04:46.300 
I like to run a second on just to make
sure<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.900> first<00:02:33.110> one<00:02:33.349> didn't<00:02:33.650> seal

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.340 

what<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.340> also<00:04:47.700> did<00:04:48.120> when<00:04:48.390> I<00:04:48.420> had<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:48.870> apart

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
what I also did when I had this apart

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.700 
what I also did when I had this apart
was<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.120> added<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.270> my<00:04:51.540> own<00:04:51.900> temporary

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
was that added in my own temporary

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.090 
was that added in my own temporary
switch<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:54.150> powers<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.320> heating<00:04:55.620> element

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
switch that powers the heating element

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.590 
switch that powers the heating element
so<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:57.480> way<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:58.110> can<00:04:58.610> time<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.820> amount<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
so that way I can time the amount the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.840 
so that way I can time the amount the
amount<00:05:00.840> of<00:05:00.990> time<00:05:02.690> for<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.870> seal<00:05:04.580> rather<00:05:05.580> than

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
amount of time for that seal rather than

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.820 
amount of time for that seal rather than
relying<00:05:06.270> on<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.840> timing<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.620> the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
relying on the timing of the the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.440 
relying on the timing of the the
FoodSaver<00:05:08.220> which<00:05:08.550> sometimes<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> little

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
FoodSaver which sometimes is a little

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.800 
FoodSaver which sometimes is a little
bit<00:05:09.600> short<00:05:10.050> for<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:10.950> heavy<00:05:11.220> plastic<00:05:11.630> so<00:05:12.630> what

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
bit short for this heavy plastic so what

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.080 
bit short for this heavy plastic so what
I<00:05:12.840> usually<00:05:13.020> do<00:05:13.380> is<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.560> make<00:05:13.830> two<00:05:14.010> seals<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
I usually do is that make two seals the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.810 
I usually do is that make two seals the
first<00:05:15.390> seal<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:16.050> count<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.860> about<00:05:16.980> four<00:05:17.430> or<00:05:17.640> five

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
first seal I count to about four or five

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.210 
first seal I count to about four or five
seconds<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:18.600> then<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:19.350> next<00:05:19.650> seal<00:05:19.830> I<00:05:19.860> make<00:05:20.190> a

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
seconds and then the next seal I make a

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.280 
seconds and then the next seal I make a
little<00:05:20.460> bit<00:05:20.670> hotter<00:05:20.880> in<00:05:21.150> count<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.870> six<00:05:22.110> or

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
little bit hotter in count to six or

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.190 
little bit hotter in count to six or
seven<00:05:22.320> seconds<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.310> make<00:05:23.460> sure<00:05:23.880> that<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:24.840> get<00:05:24.990> a

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
seven seconds to make sure that I get a

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.540 
seven seconds to make sure that I get a
hot<00:05:25.590> seal<00:05:25.950> in<00:05:26.190> case<00:05:26.400> that<00:05:26.640> first<00:05:26.880> one<00:05:27.180> failed

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.240 

I'm<00:05:32.550> not<00:05:32.850> necessarily<00:05:33.060> recommending<00:05:34.250> that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
I'm not necessarily recommending that

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.460 
I'm not necessarily recommending that
anyone<00:05:35.730> do<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.450> way<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.690> just<00:05:36.870> wanted<00:05:37.350> to
