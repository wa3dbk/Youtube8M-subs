00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.369 
be found as a silk flower and there's
just<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.820> few<00:00:14.849> rules<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.750> like<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.199> follow

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
just a few rules that I like to follow

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.040 
just a few rules that I like to follow
and<00:00:16.590> I'm<00:00:16.859> using<00:00:17.250> silk<00:00:17.550> flowers<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.869> there's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and I'm using silk flowers so there's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.660 
and I'm using silk flowers so there's
some<00:00:19.230> rules<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.590> thumb<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:20.310> you're<00:00:20.460> using

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
some rules of thumb when you're using

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
some rules of thumb when you're using
silk<00:00:21.060> flowers<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.779> basically<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.769> design<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
silk flowers and basically in design you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.330 
silk flowers and basically in design you
always<00:00:23.789> want<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> use<00:00:24.300> three<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.930> any<00:00:25.560> one

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
always want to use three of any one

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.060 
always want to use three of any one
variety<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.300> color<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.590> I'm<00:00:28.740> mixing

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
variety or one color so if I'm mixing

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.299 
variety or one color so if I'm mixing
different<00:00:29.670> types<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.980> gladiolus<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.189> are

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
different types of gladiolus that are

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
different types of gladiolus that are
silk<00:00:32.579> right<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.120> try<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> use<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.870> least

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
silk right here I try to use at least

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
silk right here I try to use at least
three<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.800> any<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.309> color<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.940> have

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
three of any one color and have

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.690 
three of any one color and have
different<00:00:36.660> size<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> tallest<00:00:38.430> one

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
different size you want the tallest one

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
different size you want the tallest one
in<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> middle<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.320> way<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
in the middle and then that way as you

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
in the middle and then that way as you
add<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.219> flowers<00:00:41.940> too<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.719> work<00:00:43.320> your

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
add more flowers too you can work your

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
add more flowers too you can work your
way<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.070> straighten<00:00:44.730> them<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.570> want

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
way and straighten them out and you want

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020 
way and straighten them out and you want
to<00:00:45.840> fill<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:47.190> rule<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> thumb<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to fill it up so I my rule of thumb is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
to fill it up so I my rule of thumb is
to<00:00:48.059> balance<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.350> try<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.980> at

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to balance it out and try to use at

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.459 
to balance it out and try to use at
least<00:00:50.460> three<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> anything<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.020> even<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
least three of anything or even go to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.160 
least three of anything or even go to
five<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.100> you're<00:00:53.219> using<00:00:53.370> different<00:00:53.670> colors<00:00:54.170> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
five if you're using different colors so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
five if you're using different colors so
the<00:00:55.289> trick<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> even<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.940> have

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the trick is to even it out and have

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.010 
the trick is to even it out and have
them<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.920> balanced<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
them all balanced and you can see this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
them all balanced and you can see this
beautiful<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.649> red<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.820> times

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
beautiful with red but a lot of times

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
beautiful with red but a lot of times
using<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.780> three<00:01:03.989> colors<00:01:04.320> makes<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
using two or three colors makes all the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.539 
using two or three colors makes all the
difference

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
difference

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.060 
difference
so<00:01:06.030> having<00:01:06.510> white<00:01:06.930> mixed<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.680> always

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
so having white mixed in is always

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.359 
so having white mixed in is always
beautiful<00:01:08.610> too<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:10.380> another<00:01:10.680> rule<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> thumb

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
beautiful too and another rule of thumb

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
beautiful too and another rule of thumb
I<00:01:11.400> found<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.299> smaller<00:01:12.750> silk<00:01:13.260> flowers<00:01:13.770> they

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I found is on smaller silk flowers they

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
I found is on smaller silk flowers they
get<00:01:14.220> lost<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.850> our<00:01:15.000> bigger<00:01:15.180> bouquet<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.960> let

arrangement<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.049> lot<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.380> showing

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
arrangement that's a lot more showing

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
arrangement that's a lot more showing
than<00:01:34.950> using<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> flowers<00:01:36.000> where<00:01:36.240> most

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
than using a lot of flowers where most

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.690 
than using a lot of flowers where most
of<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.110> lost<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.920> sticking<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
one or two or three colors I found

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
one or two or three colors I found
better<00:01:40.829> than<00:01:41.220> using<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.970> colors<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.600> just

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
better than using all the colors or just
