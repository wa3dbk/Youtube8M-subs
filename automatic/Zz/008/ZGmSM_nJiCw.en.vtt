 then let's see let's take this 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.710
 here 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.690
 share with your friends so that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 you know that you can also play in this 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 server that I'm going to do by connecting 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.140
 very much you are all invited as 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.150
 I always say and I repeat that I do not know if I have 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.670
 said that better this discussion does not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.270
 bit the voice a bit will leave a little 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.880
 and so tired but I think I I 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.450
 put a little bit more because they fall out 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.000
 the snot and I 've got cold and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 all that and things of those less I'm very 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.019
 well the boys and girls I'm sorry 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.940
 very much and good I'm going to teach the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.410
 things so that you know who is 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.030
 little is worth because this is a support to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.800
 as if well look is a little what happens 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.050
 than having a delivery that you know how 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.420
 So you know how the people live 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.180
 pokemones inside the vall there is a bow 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.300
 and fast car is whatever it is here that 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.960
 puts the throwback another 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.430
 with power or something without being able to compose and 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.050
 things of those that the truth that quite 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.690
 well and here a position of strength that 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.600
 I do not know where it's already been caught 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.370
 damn they have been caught they have taken it 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.180
 good matter 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.890
 and that's where the typical is already 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.390
 bows and arrows this good all this 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.220
 you go to current programs I'm not going to 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.709
 say nothing more enjoy the map and already 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.599
 is this point and this video is going to be a bit 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.760
 short because the only thing I want is 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.040
 teach a little how is how is the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.739
 plugin that can really be super 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.940
 well it's great that it did not get like 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:38.349
 you see some fault something me at least 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:38.349
 I'm not going to do it on the side 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.680
 we are correct 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.079
 but eye 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.810
 the agreement is that I had a lot of desire 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.510
 to record this map and play it here with 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.549
 you but really want to really 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.189
 it was a desire in which all there is 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.599
 also an incredible desire to get there 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.180
 here with you and get to 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.980
 play this map that you hand and dined on 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.769
 one afternoon and the truth that good seems 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.750
 be that you liked it and the burger king s 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.790
 I do not know what the public is called, I do not know what 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.889
 he has also liked a lot with what 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.540
 I've seen because it's a quick map but 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.819
 the time also has a lot of pvp very 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.320
 intense and the truth that is very good in 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.079
 a future we are going to add a section 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.030
 it's worth a future let's add a session 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.620
 that says how good we say that 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.210
 you can send bones you put 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.280
 more so that we can see it 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.810
 italy and well then I think how to adjust 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.430
 very much but in a future at the moment 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.949
 do not be at the moment do not say that you have 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.740
 map story because I do not know it already 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.110
 said infinities and setbacks these these 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.729
 arcs states so super che we say 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.729
 that's the best there is 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:52.430
 photo ma at some point find a 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.740
 small mistake but that's fine to say 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.740
 then hit Italy and without any problem 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.560
 ah 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.460
 we're 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.800
 open by hand 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.069
 on this server, I 'm not going to leave 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.870
 say I'm going to put the single because I eat 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.509
 do not be used 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.970
 I know it's the same, it's not a 7 w it's the same 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.009
 but since I'm not used to 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.160
 maps so I do not want to complain 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.160
 to throw 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.900
 and by the fps 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.400
 the disappearance I do not know if it is not that 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.379
 There is a doubt if yes yes yes well age 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.180
 because nobody is to say by this part 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.949
 they're all trying to cross into the wool 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.689
 guys, since you can take advantage of me 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.460
 I would like to also play is defensive 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.129
 and such that not for example that effort in 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.800
 the wiki but that at the end in your profile 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:55.599

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.900
 I will not leave anything good 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.740
 a few days 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.000
 why it bursts me 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:21.250
 barradas 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:25.230
 perfect perfect hours which I have 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.230

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.030

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.030
 please truthfulness 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.080
 excuse me and I repeat again if I 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.300
 you listen a little like that talking but it's 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.460
 I'm a little hoarse then it's worth 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.660
 well a little hoarse, but I'm a 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.360
 little bit then I go for that 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.440
 basically ostia not me the eyes do not me 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.440
