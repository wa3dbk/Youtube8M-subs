00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
video but um so that's definitely the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.320 
video but um so that's definitely the
reason<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.460> wants<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> big<00:01:17.909> object<00:01:18.060> up

like cleansing because Hajj it just
makes<00:03:24.650> your<00:03:24.770> head<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.250> going<00:03:25.640> crazy

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
makes your head just going crazy

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.440 
makes your head just going crazy
thinking<00:03:28.010> about<00:03:28.250> food<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.030> think<00:03:29.270> about

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
thinking about food and think about

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.290 
thinking about food and think about
making<00:03:29.780> better<00:03:30.020> choices<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.880> thinking

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
making better choices and and thinking

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.370 
making better choices and and thinking
about<00:03:32.390> how<00:03:33.010> how<00:03:34.010> much<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:35.000> staying<00:03:35.810> focused

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
about how how much like staying focused

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.050 
about how how much like staying focused
on<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.860> cleanse<00:03:37.100> is<00:03:37.250> like<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.520> hardest<00:03:37.790> thing

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
on the cleanse is like the hardest thing

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.460 
on the cleanse is like the hardest thing
but<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.440> allows<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.670> gain<00:03:41.440> control<00:03:42.440> over

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
but it allows you to gain control over

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.220 
but it allows you to gain control over
food<00:03:43.070> versus<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.150> opposite<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.810> think<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
food versus the opposite and I think the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.810 
food versus the opposite and I think the
reason<00:03:45.440> why<00:03:45.530> we<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:45.950> many<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.250> us<00:03:46.310> have<00:03:46.520> issues

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
reason why we so many of us have issues

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.970 
reason why we so many of us have issues
with<00:03:47.180> food<00:03:47.480> is<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:47.990> it's<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.710> lack<00:03:48.950> of

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
with food is because it's the lack of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.750 
with food is because it's the lack of
control<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.960> lot<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:51.950> us<00:03:52.130> do<00:03:52.250> allow<00:03:52.520> food

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
control and so a lot of us do allow food

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.280 
control and so a lot of us do allow food
to<00:03:53.000> control<00:03:53.330> our<00:03:53.450> lives<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.900> that's<00:03:53.960> why<00:03:54.140> we

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
to control our lives and that's why we

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.290 
to control our lives and that's why we
find<00:03:54.470> ourselves<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.610> situation<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.090> we

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
find ourselves in the situation that we

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.930 
find ourselves in the situation that we
are<00:03:56.330> in<00:03:56.480> physically<00:03:57.110> but<00:03:57.920> when<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.340> plan<00:03:58.670> is<00:03:58.820> I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
are in physically but when I plan is I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.600 
are in physically but when I plan is I
so<00:03:59.300> get<00:03:59.990> on<00:04:00.110> this<00:04:00.230> whole<00:04:00.470> mental<00:04:00.890> trip<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.430> I

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610
