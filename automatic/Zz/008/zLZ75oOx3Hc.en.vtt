00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.370
 Excuse me because I have not made any videos 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 teach how to outline my nose I have 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.760
 a super thick nose maybe on camera 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.640
 do not look your perverse but the but is 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.790
 thick I have these things here 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.129
 that I do not like and honestly a lot 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.290
 action do not be afraid of getting me 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.320
 to sleep I had surgery 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.350
 plastic in the nose a long time ago 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.079
 but as I am afraid and I am afraid that 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.910
 I'm not going to get up because I'm the one 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 I have to fix makeup game 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.820
 so today I'm going to show you my 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 contour technique of my nose for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 photography is a big difference in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.739
 zero that let one that that magazine 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.870
 see finite especially if you have 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.270
 a discreet nose like me 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.300
 and I 'm going to show you my technique and how 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.310
 I do and that's all I hope they learn 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.190
 something today if you are not subscribing to me 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 channel or do not investigate in instagram or in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.120
 seat sound were all that I leave 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 down especially in this place there 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.670
 we can connect it if it's faster 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.290
 and I think that's all ok hopefully 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 like this video and even the same 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.990
 ok girls i 'm going to do my nose can 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.620
 see that it is wide and it is thick it does not have 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.440
 definition here is my side profile and 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.290
 first what I'm going to start is to 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.720
 defining the nose bridge that is 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.700
 that with correctly clearer than your 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.729
 I'm going to apply it under the skin 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.390
 door if a finer fine fine line 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.580
 in the most beautiful line and can read 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.570
 the nose and with a brush I'll 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.570
 blur everything 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.210
 i 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.490
 i 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 ah 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.300
 ah 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.950
 since it blurs the product you can see 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.530
 right there in the fountain you can already see 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
 a little nose shape as 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.239
 I have no shape my nose because it is so 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.120
 We have to do it with the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.190
 product now with these counters text 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.739
 which are a product that is for 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.750
 control parts is around 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.870
 where there in the door of the nose where 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.930
 I put the clear product next I'm going to 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.079
 put the product dark this product 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.450
 it is very creamy it has a lot of pigment 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.790
 then it is necessary to put a lot and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.950
 I'll put it there are two lines closer 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.159
 this some lines on the tip of the nose 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.709
 more definition we will give you then 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.900
 When I do this, I'll blur it and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.690
 here you will be able to see that this product 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.909
 it's so creamy that you do not need much 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.849
 and we're going to start giving it to the nose 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.950
 a shadow so you can notice that there 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.750
 nobody if it does not look so wide and can 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.209
 see that I'm giving him a little bit of 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.920
 shadow the left and right side 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.920
 when I'm blurring 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.810
 because my nose day is long with the 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.209
 same product on the tip of the nose 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.910
 I'm going to apply this dark color to 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.979
 give him shade and this is going to make the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.919
 nose appear that is a little bit more 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.919
 short and small of what it really is 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.980
 ah 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.349
 now where I applied this product 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.020
 I'm going to apply another product there 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.199
 which is clear and only in the middle I'm going to 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.120
 put this is to illuminate as I said 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.370
 is the source of the nose because this one goes 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.979
 to be the focus especially when 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.199
 I take pictures makes a big difference 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.349
 do this and the nose does not look super 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.969
 I 'm going to blur it because this 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.110
 product is cream and I have skin 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.449
 fatty 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.059
 It is very important that we apply a 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.860
 powder so that it stays there and does not 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:09.589
 go to move the product then here 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 I'm using parana because it 's good if 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:15.430
 you are medium skin dark skin 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.919
 now with a dark shadow just just 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.560
 a little bit, let's put dust where 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.380
 We put the color dark and this only for 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.000
 that you notice more of photography I do not 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.729
 I want an outline that people can 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.949
 see how a friend from afar I want something 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.560
 that looks smooth but looks good with 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.900
 water I recorded them and I took pictures that is 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.270
 very important now with an illuminator 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.040
 I will put a little bit of it again in the 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.889
 source just to make it look a little 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.650
 more a little bit shiny and there they can already 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.650
 see that you can nose with definition 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.320
 there with my makeup you can see that 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.990
 shaped is not so wide because if 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.750
 I do not do that the nose loses my 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.449
 face and you do not notice it and it does not look good on 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.270
 photos only looks thick from here they 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.010
 I give definition and that's all boys 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.800
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.979
 who have learned a technique and even the 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.979
 next
