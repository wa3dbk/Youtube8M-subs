00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.290
 a trip full of places and characters 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.790
 only starting with the foot itself 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.550
 Cantabrian road is full of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 own rock its own wildlife and a 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.630
 culture cemented in the vicinity of the sea 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.150
 and the heights we reach cangas de onís 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.399
 city ​​located at the foot of the massif 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.680
 western of the peaks of europe and that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.430
 It was the capital of the kingdom of Asturias until 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.170
 the year 700 74 over the river seals in the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.660
 emblematic medieval bridge of the city 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.390
 I meet with ramón celorio great chef 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.760
 and knowledgeable about the Cangués landscape that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 will guide in the secrets of cooking and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.700
 the products of the place are noises 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.790
 sausages 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.200
 and then the methods in the robot will 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.810
 we make an oil we thrill him 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.430
 I only have to taste and ready 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.430
 with good product we did not know 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.759
 good 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.840
 do not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.490
 the terminal 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.060
 provided that in this case it does not stop 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 amaze me 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.010
 a case that is very close to here 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990
 where I am in areas of cabrales to 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.670
 few minutes is one of the best 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.259
 cheeses from Spain but by difference 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.049
 and it's something that does not surprise me because 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.430
 in asturias if they know something they can do 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.160

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.630
 Cabrales enjoys international fame for 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.300
 the blue cheese that bears his name and is 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.840
 mountains 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.140
 and as if all this had been little 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.570
 We are going down the village that shelters 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.659

 in the family home and difficult and it has 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.680

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.030
