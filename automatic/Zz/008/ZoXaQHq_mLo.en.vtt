00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.790
 as you know at aura net on 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.259
 like Chinese smartphones have 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.809
 Explores smartphones 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 Chinese the mark of the moment among 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.450
 Chinese it is and the phones and who has 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.870
 a lot of success among importers 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.150
 in France and here is the p7000 with a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 strapping while aluminum and design 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.760
 rather nice 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 in any case on the photos the problem 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.430
 is that this smartphone is a bit 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.430
 draft we will explain why 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 this p7000 on the photos is really 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 very attractive very attractive with a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 very clean aesthetics the problem is 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 when you have it in your hands it's already 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 a lot less attractive 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 nothing really serious about him 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 blame it on the level of 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 finishes some joins are enough 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.180
 irregular so that gives enough a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.879
 impression quite mixed enough 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.559
 blurs on the finish of this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.270
 smartphone that remains however quite 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.039
 correct for his second loan 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 rather mixed consideration is his 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.489
 screen so its screen is pretty good 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.410
 quite correct with a rate of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.120
 contrast of 1300 for a about what 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.549
 is absolutely correct the only problem 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.340
 is that its brightness is not enough 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 strong for full use 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.520
 sun as today's third 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.200
 pretty rough aspect pretty disappointing this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.970
 are the performance of the device with 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.040
 a very good midrange processor 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.100
 and 3 gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.020
 the phone's performance is very 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.720
 very irregular especially in games 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 video where we found a lot of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.450
 downturns 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.340
 which actually proves that the phone 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.000
 is not optimized enough at the level of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 his software 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 p7000 photos in full brightness 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's pretty good the only problem is 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.430
 in low light 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.110
 the result is really bad one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.970
 image that loses all its details 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.710
 it's one of the worst results we have 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.630
 had low light with a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 smartphone the least comfort aspect 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.530
 and the phone's autonomy about seven 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 hours in our tests 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 very severe autonomy and 15 hours in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.430
 call which is not miraculous but 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.960
 quite satisfactory for the price 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.580
 finally the only good surprise of this 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 phone is its fingerprint sensor 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.900
 who is very efficient who is walking 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.060
 close as well as that of the iphone 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.590
 which is very fast and almost never 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.700
 mistakes if you put your finger in 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 sensor center for 270 euros it's 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.780
 not such a good deal finally but 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.550
 it's not a bad laptop for 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.560
 as much as he was granted three stars this 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.390
 which is a note finally pretty good 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.500
 above average but it does not 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.660
 clearly deserves no 4 stars 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.110
 especially for its very performance 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.110
 irregular
