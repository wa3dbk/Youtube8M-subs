this<00:00:32.790> angle<00:00:33.180> KO<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.930> constant<00:00:34.469> where<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.770> are

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this angle KO the constant where we are

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.690 
this angle KO the constant where we are
under<00:00:35.399> 200<00:00:36.149> darkness<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.380> $15<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.550> dual

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
is us now actually this model is rupture

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:00.100 
is us now actually this model is rupture
ok<00:01:51.240> 29<00:01:51.810> 1<00:01:52.280> 29<00:01:53.280> 18<00:01:54.320> all<00:01:55.320> right<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.930> one
