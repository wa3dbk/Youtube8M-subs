wire foam cutter like this I mean it's
optional<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> makes<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.670> quick<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.909> easy<00:01:06.119> to

do this but it's totally optional maybe
a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:10.110> sandpaper<00:01:10.470> would<00:01:11.130> help<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.090> that's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
a little sandpaper would help so that's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
a little sandpaper would help so that's
it<00:01:12.659> there's<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> whole<00:01:13.260> lot<00:01:13.290> -<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> looks

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
really good comes out great and it's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
really good comes out great and it's
pretty<00:01:16.650> sturdy<00:01:16.860> when<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.180> know<00:01:18.270> take

the time with it you can use the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.510 
the time with it you can use the
sandpaper<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.270> stuff<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:29.340> just

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
for something like this a small project

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.369 
for something like this a small project
with<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.370> lot<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.579> detail<00:03:55.060> just<00:03:55.299> take<00:03:56.109> your<00:03:56.259> time

thick that's it just keep carving in the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.969 
thick that's it just keep carving in the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
this is like a hollow section slightly

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.309 
this is like a hollow section slightly
hollowed<00:04:37.919> or<00:04:38.069> indented<00:04:38.659> this<00:04:39.659> is<00:04:39.900> optional

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
hollowed or indented this is optional

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.770

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
but you can cut away just the top layer

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.580 
but you can cut away just the top layer
of<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.960> foam

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
of a foam

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.580 
of a foam
excuse<00:04:44.400> me<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.669> paper<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.419> then<00:04:46.080> peel<00:04:46.379> that

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
excuse me of paper and then peel that

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.040 
excuse me of paper and then peel that

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
off exposing the foam underneath and

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.779 
off exposing the foam underneath and
then<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.680> way<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:49.919> has<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.069> different<00:04:50.460> texture

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
then that way it has a different texture

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.909 
then that way it has a different texture
to<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.210> looks<00:04:51.509> different<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.139> it'll<00:04:52.770> take

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
to it it looks different and it'll take

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.730 
to it it looks different and it'll take
the<00:04:53.039> paint<00:04:53.279> differently<00:04:53.729> it's<00:04:54.689> optional<00:04:55.199> and
