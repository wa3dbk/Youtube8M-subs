00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.539 
crystallite HS 3540 rear hub motor this
thing<00:00:11.639> would<00:00:11.849> gave<00:00:12.059> me<00:00:12.269> 35<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.559> 40<00:00:14.160> miles<00:00:14.370> an

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
thing would gave me 35 to 40 miles an

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.250 
thing would gave me 35 to 40 miles an
hour

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
hour

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.640 
hour
and<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.160> working<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.699> right<00:00:17.760> now<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
and what I'm working on right now is

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.019 
and what I'm working on right now is
figuring<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.100> location<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> where<00:00:20.880> I'm

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
figuring out the location of where I'm

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.560 
figuring out the location of where I'm
going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.330> mount<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.720> battery<00:00:22.170> pack<00:00:23.420> what<00:00:24.420> I've

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
going to mount my battery pack what I've

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
going to mount my battery pack what I've
seen<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:25.890> research<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.430> did<00:00:26.490> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
seen on the little research I did is

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.000 
seen on the little research I did is
most<00:00:27.180> folks<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.779> mount<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.470> above

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
most folks would mount it right above

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.530 
most folks would mount it right above
the<00:00:29.070> rear<00:00:29.400> wheel<00:00:30.080> with<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> rack<00:00:32.059> this<00:00:33.059> might<00:00:33.360> be

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the rear wheel with a rack this might be

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.590 
the rear wheel with a rack this might be
the<00:00:33.690> easiest<00:00:34.020> way<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.420> gonna

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the easiest way but it's just not gonna

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
the easiest way but it's just not gonna
work<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:37.050> me<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.239> battery

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
work for me I think that the battery

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.709 
work for me I think that the battery
pack<00:00:39.510> weights<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> just

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
pack weights a little bit and just

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
pack weights a little bit and just
mounting<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.050> high<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> shift

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
mounting it so high it's going to shift

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.779 
mounting it so high it's going to shift
my<00:00:44.430> center<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> gravity<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.460> also<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> don't

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
my center of gravity and also I don't

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
my center of gravity and also I don't
want<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.750> weight<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> back

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
want to have all the weight in the back

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.880 
want to have all the weight in the back
of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> bike<00:00:50.120> Motors<00:00:51.120> already<00:00:51.510> 16<00:00:52.050> pounds<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
of the bike Motors already 16 pounds and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
of the bike Motors already 16 pounds and
by<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> weight<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
by the time you have the weight of a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.799 
by the time you have the weight of a
battery<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> weight<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> be

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
battery it's all the weight going to be

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
battery it's all the weight going to be
shifted<00:00:57.809> bugs<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.949> optimum

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
shifted bugs so I think the optimum

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
shifted bugs so I think the optimum
location<00:00:59.579> for<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:01.160> inside

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
location for me is going to be inside

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.130 
location for me is going to be inside
the<00:01:02.219> bike<00:01:02.609> frame<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> did<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.479> mount

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the bike frame so what I did to mount

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460 
the bike frame so what I did to mount
the<00:01:07.320> batteries<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:09.390> went<00:01:09.750> ahead<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.260> bought

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the batteries is I went ahead and bought

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.350 
the batteries is I went ahead and bought
a<00:01:10.770> piece<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.820> poplar<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.640> what<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> did<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.150> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
a piece of poplar and what I did is I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.289 
a piece of poplar and what I did is I
rather<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.110> edges<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> top<00:01:17.220> side<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
rather the edges on the top side this is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.859 
rather the edges on the top side this is
about<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> half<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.200> inch<00:01:19.290> radius<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.869> machine

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
about a half an inch radius and machine

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.859 
about a half an inch radius and machine
decides<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.920> I'll<00:01:23.850> show<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> why<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.630> just

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
decides and I'll show you why in just

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.600 
decides and I'll show you why in just
one<00:01:25.439> minute<00:01:27.229> once<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.710> done<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
one minute once I got this done all I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.240 
one minute once I got this done all I
had<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.750> measure<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.470> angles<00:01:31.979> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
had to do is just measure the angles on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.719 
had to do is just measure the angles on
my<00:01:32.670> triangle<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> bike<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.549> build<00:01:35.549> my

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
my triangle in the bike and build my

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
my triangle in the bike and build my
triangle<00:01:36.299> where<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.720> batteries<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.170> going

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
triangle where the batteries are going

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100 
triangle where the batteries are going
to<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.790> okay<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> built

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to go okay as you can see here I built

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.520 
to go okay as you can see here I built
my<00:01:40.320> battery<00:01:40.799> box<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.670> wool<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.240> rather<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
my battery box out of wool I rather the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.249 
my battery box out of wool I rather the
edges<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> spray-painted<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
edges and also have it spray-painted in

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.780 
edges and also have it spray-painted in
white<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.210> also<00:01:48.210> built<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.869> side<00:01:49.229> box<00:01:49.759> use<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
white I also built this side box use a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.690 
white I also built this side box use a
thin<00:01:51.299> plastic<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:53.100> also<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
thin plastic and I also have it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840 
thin plastic and I also have it
spray-painted<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.990> pre-drill<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> just

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
spray-painted and pre-drill this is just

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.389 
spray-painted and pre-drill this is just
a<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.719> thin<00:01:58.079> piece<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.530> plastic<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.130> found

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
a really thin piece of plastic I found

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.969 
a really thin piece of plastic I found
and<00:01:59.840> that's<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> sides<00:02:01.770> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and that's going to go on the sides of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.819 
and that's going to go on the sides of
the<00:02:02.100> box<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.240> let's<00:02:03.270> mount<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> bike

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the box so let's mount it on the bike

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:53.110 
the box so let's mount it on the bike
and<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.640> how<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.969> fits

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.520 

okay<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.420> went<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.780> here<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.170> got<00:02:55.349> my

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
okay so I went to here then I got my

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.900 
okay so I went to here then I got my
side<00:02:55.920> panel<00:02:56.340> mounted<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:57.030> also<00:02:58.670> mounted<00:02:59.670> my

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
side panel mounted I also mounted my

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.990 
side panel mounted I also mounted my

connectors and for battery medics and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.839 
connectors and for battery medics and
the<00:03:28.019> way<00:03:28.170> I'm<00:03:28.319> going<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.590> use<00:03:28.799> this<00:03:29.099> is<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
the way I'm going to use this is the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.059 
the way I'm going to use this is the
extensions<00:03:30.660> are<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.049> be<00:03:31.170> cut<00:03:31.500> roughly

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
extensions are going to be cut roughly

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.930 
extensions are going to be cut roughly
in<00:03:32.400> half<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.560> connecting<00:03:35.160> port<00:03:35.459> will<00:03:35.790> be

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
in half and the connecting port will be

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.789 
in half and the connecting port will be
hooked<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:37.250> my<00:03:38.250> connector<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.930> male<00:03:40.440> side

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
hooked to my connector the male side

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.470 
hooked to my connector the male side
will<00:03:41.099> go<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.610> port<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:44.250> female<00:03:45.180> side

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
will go to the port and the female side

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.920 
will go to the port and the female side
is<00:03:45.780> going<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.260> go<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:47.190> connector<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.970> once

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
is going to go to the connector so once

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.619 
is going to go to the connector so once
I<00:03:49.110> cut<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.650> would<00:03:49.799> go<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.910> the

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
I cut it that would go that in and the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.280 
I cut it that would go that in and the
other<00:03:51.720> end<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.110> going<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.349> go<00:03:52.410> here<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:54.290> then

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
other end is going to go here so then

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.490 
other end is going to go here so then
this<00:03:56.180> male<00:03:57.180> side<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.019> hook<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.380> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
this male side is going to hook to the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.319 
this male side is going to hook to the
batteries<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.730> that's<00:03:59.910> what's<00:04:00.090> going<00:04:00.239> to

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
batteries and that's what's going to

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.870 
batteries and that's what's going to
take<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:01.470> information<00:04:02.040> out<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.489> battery

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
take the information out of the battery

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.050 
take the information out of the battery
box<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.810> will<00:04:04.019> hook<00:04:04.290> through<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:05.060> connector

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
box it will hook through the connector

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.910 
box it will hook through the connector
and<00:04:06.209> from<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.230> on<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.900> female<00:04:10.319> side<00:04:10.650> is

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
and from there on the female side is

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.580 
and from there on the female side is
going<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.760> attach<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.810> battery<00:04:13.170> Maddox

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
going to attach to the battery Maddox

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.460 
going to attach to the battery Maddox
and<00:04:13.739> that's<00:04:14.670> how<00:04:14.880> I'm<00:04:14.970> going<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.239> monitor<00:04:15.660> my

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and that's how I'm going to monitor my

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680 
and that's how I'm going to monitor my
batteries<00:04:16.979> without<00:04:17.729> having<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.299> open<00:04:18.599> the

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
batteries without having to open the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.760 
batteries without having to open the
battery<00:04:18.989> box<00:04:20.599> okay<00:04:21.599> one<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.049> reasons<00:04:22.470> why

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
battery box okay one of the reasons why

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.800 
battery box okay one of the reasons why
my<00:04:23.130> wires<00:04:23.490> don't<00:04:23.880> look<00:04:24.030> all<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.360> same<00:04:24.599> in

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
my wires don't look all the same in

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.839 
my wires don't look all the same in
every<00:04:24.960> battery<00:04:25.500> pack<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:26.039> because<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.700> way

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
every battery pack is because the way

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.000 
every battery pack is because the way
they're<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.270> be<00:04:27.360> mounted<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:27.870> my

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
they're going to be mounted in my

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.800 
they're going to be mounted in my
battery<00:04:29.010> box<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.729> I'll<00:04:29.849> show<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.210> as<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.630> go

battery box and I'll show you as I go

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.990 
battery box and I'll show you as I go
through<00:04:30.840> on<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:32.130> one<00:04:32.310> for<00:04:32.460> example<00:04:32.580> is

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
through on this one for example is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.200 
through on this one for example is
number<00:04:33.690> three<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.260> my<00:04:35.190> balance<00:04:35.460> leaves<00:04:35.910> are

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
number three and my balance leaves are

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.830 
number three and my balance leaves are
coming<00:04:36.389> out<00:04:36.630> of<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.840> back<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.669> my<00:04:38.669> main<00:04:39.450> wires

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
coming out of the back and my main wires

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540 
coming out of the back and my main wires
are<00:04:40.169> a<00:04:40.200> little<00:04:40.380> bit<00:04:40.620> longer<00:04:40.950> than<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.280> other

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
are a little bit longer than the other

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.440 
are a little bit longer than the other
ones<00:04:41.849> so<00:04:42.660> this<00:04:42.840> one's<00:04:43.050> going<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> go<00:04:43.380> here<00:04:43.889> I

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
ones so this one's going to go here I

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.029 
ones so this one's going to go here I
also<00:04:45.450> have<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.870> cut<00:04:46.229> out<00:04:46.349> a<00:04:46.380> notch<00:04:46.650> on<00:04:46.979> my

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
also have to cut out a notch on my

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.520 
also have to cut out a notch on my
battery<00:04:47.490> box<00:04:47.789> they<00:04:48.240> were<00:04:48.300> really<00:04:48.750> tight<00:04:49.229> so

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
battery box they were really tight so

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.960 
battery box they were really tight so
without<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.190> notching<00:04:50.669> there<00:04:50.820> they

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
without that notching there they

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.500 
without that notching there they
wouldn't<00:04:51.300> have<00:04:51.419> fit<00:04:53.000> next<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.150> going<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.360> be

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
wouldn't have fit next it's going to be

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.370 
wouldn't have fit next it's going to be
my<00:04:54.720> number<00:04:55.560> two<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.510> as<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.660> can<00:04:57.840> see<00:04:58.050> on<00:04:58.200> this

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
my number two and as you can see on this

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.830 
my number two and as you can see on this
one's<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:59.280> balance<00:04:59.880> leaves<00:05:00.090> also<00:05:00.389> come<00:05:00.810> out

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
one's the balance leaves also come out

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.890 
one's the balance leaves also come out
of<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.110> back<00:05:01.320> but<00:05:02.190> my<00:05:02.640> main<00:05:03.180> connectors<00:05:03.690> are

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
of the back but my main connectors are

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.349 
of the back but my main connectors are
really<00:05:04.200> short

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:05.359 
really short

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:15.799 
really short
so<00:05:06.359> this<00:05:06.629> one<00:05:09.259> schedule<00:05:10.259> right<00:05:11.069> there<00:05:13.519> and<00:05:14.809> on

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:15.809 
so this one schedule right there and on

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.099 
so this one schedule right there and on
this<00:05:16.049> one<00:05:16.319> my<00:05:16.799> balance<00:05:17.219> leads<00:05:17.579> and<00:05:18.109> main

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:19.109 
this one my balance leads and main

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:22.459 
this one my balance leads and main
connector<00:05:19.619> come<00:05:19.859> out<00:05:19.979> of<00:05:20.099> the<00:05:20.189> same<00:05:20.369> in<00:05:21.469> this

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469 
connector come out of the same in this
