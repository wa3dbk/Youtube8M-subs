service announcement that my friend
Roque<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.259> I<00:00:22.380> made<00:00:22.710> over<00:00:23.520> a<00:00:23.550> period<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.150> about

Roque and I made over a period of about

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.109 
Roque and I made over a period of about
two<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> half<00:00:24.930> weeks<00:00:25.579> the<00:00:26.579> visual<00:00:26.880> effects

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
two and a half weeks the visual effects

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
two and a half weeks the visual effects
were<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.329> really<00:00:27.930> important<00:00:28.380> element<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.770> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
were a really important element of the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
were a really important element of the
film<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.429> because<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.880> our<00:00:30.119> concept

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
film just because of our concept

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.320 
film just because of our concept
completely<00:00:31.259> depended<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.129> it<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.210> were

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
completely depended on it so we were

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.530 
completely depended on it so we were
really<00:00:33.540> happy<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> find<00:00:35.239> such<00:00:36.239> an<00:00:36.360> awesome

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
really happy to find such an awesome

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.210 
really happy to find such an awesome
house<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.170> shoot<00:00:37.379> at<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.830> completely

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
house to shoot at it was completely

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.479 
house to shoot at it was completely
charred<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> beat-up<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.710> environment

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
charred and beat-up but the environment

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.569 
charred and beat-up but the environment
was<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.269> not<00:00:42.449> appropriate<00:00:42.949> so<00:00:43.949> we<00:00:44.100> shot<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
was just not appropriate so we shot the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
was just not appropriate so we shot the
footage<00:00:44.909> with<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.180> intention<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.039> completely

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
footage with the intention of completely

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.060 
footage with the intention of completely
replacing<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.989> environment<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.860> why

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
replacing the environment which is why

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.930 
replacing the environment which is why
Rochas<00:00:50.820> car<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.449> completely<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> frame<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Rochas car is completely in the frame so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
Rochas car is completely in the frame so
we<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.359> took<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> frame<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> shot<00:00:55.859> into

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
we we took a frame from the shot into

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.619 
we we took a frame from the shot into
Photoshop<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> figure<00:00:57.510> out

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
Photoshop just to kind of figure out

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
Photoshop just to kind of figure out
what<00:00:58.410> exactly<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.010> wanted<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> look<00:00:59.699> like

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
what exactly we wanted it to look like

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
what exactly we wanted it to look like
we<00:01:00.510> knew<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.780> wanted<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> lighten<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
we knew we wanted to lighten up the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
we knew we wanted to lighten up the
house<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.879> look<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.269> like<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
house just to make it look more like a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.999 
house just to make it look more like a
hurricane<00:01:03.989> hit

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
hurricane hit

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.800 
hurricane hit
we<00:01:05.519> expanded<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> bunch<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.539> different

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
we expanded with a bunch of different

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.770 
we expanded with a bunch of different
photos<00:01:06.929> that<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.259> just<00:01:07.410> pulled<00:01:07.619> off<00:01:07.740> Google<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
photos that I just pulled off Google and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.410 
photos that I just pulled off Google and
we<00:01:09.780> deviated<00:01:10.259> from<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.679> significantly<00:01:11.550> later

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
we deviated from it significantly later

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.070 
we deviated from it significantly later
but<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.250> good<00:01:14.429> to<00:01:14.550> do<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.940> wasn't<00:01:15.869> really

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but it was good to do I wasn't really

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
but it was good to do I wasn't really
sure<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.560> exactly<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:17.340> gonna<00:01:17.520> accomplish

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
sure how exactly we're gonna accomplish

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
sure how exactly we're gonna accomplish
this<00:01:18.179> but<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> knew<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.170> first<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:19.649> we<00:01:19.800> needed

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
this but I knew at first that we needed

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.040 
this but I knew at first that we needed
to<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.880> gonna<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.179> a<00:01:21.209> 3d<00:01:21.539> solution

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
to you know it's gonna be a 3d solution

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.900 
to you know it's gonna be a 3d solution
and<00:01:22.470> therefore<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.950> needed<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> track<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
and therefore we needed to track the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.350 
and therefore we needed to track the
camera<00:01:24.090> move<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.349> we<00:01:25.590> did<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> pull<00:01:26.190> up<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.729> don't

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
camera move so we did a pull up I don't

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
camera move so we did a pull up I don't
know<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> fairly<00:01:27.690> basic<00:01:27.929> match<00:01:28.800> move<00:01:29.069> in<00:01:29.429> PF

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
know a fairly basic match move in PF

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.900 
know a fairly basic match move in PF
track<00:01:30.599> and<00:01:30.869> brought<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.679> data<00:01:32.429> back<00:01:32.729> into

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
track and brought that data back into

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.990 
track and brought that data back into
blender<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.539> I<00:01:33.989> experimented<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.789> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
blender and I experimented a lot with a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.300 
blender and I experimented a lot with a
few<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.750> techniques<00:01:37.009> just<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.099> try<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
few different techniques just to try to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.830 
few different techniques just to try to
figure<00:01:38.550> out<00:01:38.670> how<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.569> that<00:01:39.630> we

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
figure out how to get the look that we

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.229 
figure out how to get the look that we
were<00:01:39.929> going<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.489> ended<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.849> doing<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:42.239 
were going for but we ended up doing a

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.169 
were going for but we ended up doing a
fairly<00:01:42.479> straightforward<00:01:42.959> camera<00:01:43.739> projection

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
fairly straightforward camera projection

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.870 
fairly straightforward camera projection
kind<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.270> situation<00:01:45.959> in<00:01:46.140> blender<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.550> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
kind of situation in blender but that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.169 
kind of situation in blender but that
doesn't<00:01:48.239> mean<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.569> easy<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:50.610> started<00:01:51.060> with

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
doesn't mean it was easy we started with

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.960 
doesn't mean it was easy we started with
six<00:01:51.509> parts<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.619> matte<00:01:52.979> painting<00:01:53.399> each

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
six parts of one matte painting each

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.960 
six parts of one matte painting each
part<00:01:54.539> had<00:01:54.780> an<00:01:54.899> isolated<00:01:55.470> element<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.819> would

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
part had an isolated element that would

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.770 
part had an isolated element that would
be<00:01:57.179> modeled<00:01:57.539> separately<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.259> 3d<00:01:59.420> but<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.599> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
be modeled separately in 3d but this is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.440 
be modeled separately in 3d but this is
all<00:02:01.020> about<00:02:01.259> approximation<00:02:02.300> camera<00:02:03.300> mapping

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
all about approximation camera mapping

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630 
all about approximation camera mapping
is<00:02:03.720> about<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.110> illusion<00:02:04.709> of<00:02:04.950> space<00:02:05.280> so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
is about the illusion of space so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.089 
is about the illusion of space so
everything<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.239> very<00:02:06.270> rough<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:07.800> final

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
everything is very rough so the final

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.930 
everything is very rough so the final
render<00:02:08.489> was<00:02:08.670> full<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.239> flaws<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.959> this

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
render was full of flaws like this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.660 
render was full of flaws like this
stretching<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.220> duplication<00:02:14.220> here

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
stretching here and and duplication here

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.600 
stretching here and and duplication here
and<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:15.000> course<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.739> ground<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.250> sky

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and of course the ground in the sky

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.740 
and of course the ground in the sky
problem<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.830> couldn't<00:02:19.830> quite<00:02:19.950> figure<00:02:20.010> out

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
problem that I couldn't quite figure out

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.250 
problem that I couldn't quite figure out
but<00:02:21.750> essentially<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.620> illusion<00:02:23.129> works<00:02:23.400> and

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
but essentially the illusion works and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.070 
but essentially the illusion works and
that's<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> main<00:02:25.530> thing

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
that's the main thing

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.600 
that's the main thing
a<00:02:26.110> composite<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.730> house<00:02:28.260> seems<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.610> be

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
a composite with the house seems to be

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.550 
a composite with the house seems to be
fairly<00:02:30.850> convincing<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.840> at<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.080> point<00:02:32.260> we

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
fairly convincing so at this point we

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.400 
fairly convincing so at this point we
just<00:02:32.590> added<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.340> few<00:02:33.370> layers<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.300> smoke<00:02:34.870> stock

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
just added a few layers of smoke stock

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.500 
just added a few layers of smoke stock
footage<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.910> give<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.210> little<00:02:37.390> more

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
footage just to give it a little more

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.710 
footage just to give it a little more
depth<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:38.560> actually<00:02:38.830> stabilized<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.790> camera

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
depth we actually stabilized the camera

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.050 
depth we actually stabilized the camera
further<00:02:40.990> even<00:02:41.500> though<00:02:41.710> we<00:02:41.920> shot<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.370> with<00:02:42.850> a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
further even though we shot it with a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.680 
further even though we shot it with a
glidecam<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:45.670> added<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> color<00:02:46.450> correction

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
glidecam we added the color correction

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.380 
glidecam we added the color correction
which<00:02:47.020> completely<00:02:47.920> sort<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.490> transforms<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
which completely sort of transforms the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.300 
which completely sort of transforms the
feeling<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.810> shot<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.920> think<00:02:51.160> it

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
feeling of the shot and I think it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.850 
feeling of the shot and I think it
worked<00:02:52.300> pretty<00:02:52.450> well<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:53.290> thanks<00:02:53.770> for

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
worked pretty well so thanks for

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
worked pretty well so thanks for
watching<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.490> hope<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.940> enjoyed<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
watching I hope you enjoyed it and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.880 
watching I hope you enjoyed it and
thanks
