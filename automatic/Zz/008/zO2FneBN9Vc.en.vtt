going to give you two possible ideas

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
going to give you two possible ideas
right<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:58.979> when<00:01:59.700> i<00:01:59.729> first<00:01:59.790> saw<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.630> like

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
right now when i first saw it I was like

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.539 
right now when i first saw it I was like
okay<00:02:01.290> there's<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.829> darker<00:02:02.219> silhouette

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
okay there's this darker silhouette

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
okay there's this darker silhouette
inside<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> mean<00:02:03.630> what<00:02:04.439> could

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
inside what could that mean what could

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
inside what could that mean what could
it<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.570> thinking<00:02:06.869> maybe

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
it actually be and I was thinking maybe

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
it actually be and I was thinking maybe
we're<00:02:07.649> looking<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:08.250> from<00:02:08.580> below<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.000> we're

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
we're looking up from below and we're

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.380 
we're looking up from below and we're
actually<00:02:09.479> looking<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> ceiling<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
actually looking at the ceiling and the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.660 
actually looking at the ceiling and the
is<00:02:11.569> like<00:02:11.840> lying<00:02:12.319> flat<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.130> ceiling<00:02:13.550> and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
is like lying flat on the ceiling and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.760 
is like lying flat on the ceiling and
he's<00:02:13.819> wearing<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.360> wet<00:02:14.660> shirt<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.380> that's

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
he's wearing like a wet shirt and that's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.110 
he's wearing like a wet shirt and that's
why<00:02:15.860> we<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> darkest<00:02:16.640> silhouette<00:02:17.000> is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
why we have the darkest silhouette is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.610 
why we have the darkest silhouette is
because<00:02:17.300> it's<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.540> sticking<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.410> actual

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
because it's like sticking to the actual

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.440 
because it's like sticking to the actual
floor<00:02:18.980> below<00:02:19.340> him<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.819> that's<00:02:20.000> why<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.330> this

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
floor below him and that's why it's this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.970 
floor below him and that's why it's this
really<00:02:20.510> weird<00:02:20.870> shape<00:02:21.200> as<00:02:21.410> well<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:21.800> then<00:02:21.920> I

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
really weird shape as well but then I

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.340 
really weird shape as well but then I
was<00:02:22.069> like<00:02:22.130> hold<00:02:22.490> on<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.540> his<00:02:23.690> head<00:02:23.990> too

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
was like hold on it's on his head too

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.440 
was like hold on it's on his head too
and<00:02:24.709> what<00:02:25.370> relation<00:02:25.730> does<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
and what relation does that have to the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.390 
and what relation does that have to the
unmarked<00:02:26.990> man<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.560> he<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.890> some

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
unmarked man is he going to be some

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.060 
unmarked man is he going to be some
victim<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.540> murder<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.290> there's<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.800> no

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
victim of a murder and there's like no

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.770 
victim of a murder and there's like no
cause<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.430> death<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.060> visible<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.660> so

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
cause of death that is visible and so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.570 
cause of death that is visible and so
he's<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> unmarked<00:02:33.709> man<00:02:33.950> or<00:02:34.190> whatever<00:02:34.310> but

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
he's the unmarked man or whatever but

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.060 
he's the unmarked man or whatever but
that<00:02:34.820> sounds<00:02:35.660> way<00:02:35.900> too<00:02:35.930> close<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.680> being<00:02:36.830> a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
that sounds way too close to being a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.580 
that sounds way too close to being a
Sherlock<00:02:37.550> Holmes<00:02:37.790> book<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.390> far<00:02:39.020> too<00:02:39.260> far

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
Sherlock Holmes book and far too far

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.979 
Sherlock Holmes book and far too far
away<00:02:39.739> from<00:02:40.190> being<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.459> black<00:02:40.640> ops<00:02:40.850> 3<00:02:41.120> teaser<00:02:41.390> so

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
away from being a black ops 3 teaser so

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.020 
away from being a black ops 3 teaser so
what<00:02:42.350> else<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.770> we<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.220> go<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.580> mean<00:02:43.790> it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
what else do we have to go on I mean it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.670 
what else do we have to go on I mean it
looks<00:02:44.239> like<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.570> guy<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.750> wearing<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.350> shirt

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
looks like the guy is wearing a shirt

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.740 
looks like the guy is wearing a shirt
because<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.730> see<00:02:46.940> his<00:02:47.120> sleeves<00:02:47.510> look

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
because you can see his sleeves look

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.170 
because you can see his sleeves look
like<00:02:47.900> they've<00:02:48.050> been<00:02:48.200> rolled<00:02:48.470> up<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:49.489> again

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
like they've been rolled up but again

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.550 
like they've been rolled up but again
just<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.510> silhouette<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.290> inner

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
just the silhouette that inner

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
silhouette with the sharp arms inside

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.000 
silhouette with the sharp arms inside

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
just look very peculiar to me and if it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.580 
just look very peculiar to me and if it
is<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.220> symbolic<00:02:59.000> thing<00:02:59.450> if<00:02:59.690> it's<00:02:59.870> not<00:03:00.110> actually

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
is a symbolic thing if it's not actually

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.920 
is a symbolic thing if it's not actually
like<00:03:00.830> not<00:03:01.430> actually<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> sort<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.150> photo<00:03:02.510> that

layered<00:03:05.480> on<00:03:05.750> top<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.260> symbolize<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.040> fact

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
layered on top to symbolize the fact

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.910
