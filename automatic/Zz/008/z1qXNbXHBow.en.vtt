supersonic airliner and traveling just
faster<00:00:54.420> than<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> speed<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> sound

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
faster than the speed of sound

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.549 
faster than the speed of sound
whereas<00:00:56.280> fire<00:00:56.520> flash<00:00:56.789> travels<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.600> 4,000

miles an hour

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.400 
miles an hour
which<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.550> four<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.449> five<00:01:00.629> times<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> speed<00:01:01.170> of

which is four or five times the speed of
sound<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.409> big<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sound and it's pretty big it's about the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.270 
sound and it's pretty big it's about the
same<00:01:06.689> length<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.590> too<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
same length this little bit too if not a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.109 
same length this little bit too if not a
bit<00:01:08.460> longer<00:01:08.760> add<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.350> wingspan<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
bit longer add on the wingspan is

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.499 
bit longer add on the wingspan is
roughly<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> same<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.720> well<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:14.420> it's<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
roughly the same as well and it's a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.170 
roughly the same as well and it's a
rather<00:01:15.659> rather<00:01:16.229> nifty<00:01:16.409> looking<00:01:16.710> plane<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> as

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
rather rather nifty looking plane and as

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060 
rather rather nifty looking plane and as
well<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.320> rather<00:01:19.560> cool<00:01:19.770> looking

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
well it's a right rather cool looking

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
well it's a right rather cool looking
plane<00:01:20.280> I've<00:01:20.400> always<00:01:20.610> thought<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.880> it's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
plane I've always thought that it's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.050 
plane I've always thought that it's
always<00:01:21.450> been<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.900> favorite<00:01:22.350> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it and but back here I wasn't entirely

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
it and but back here I wasn't entirely
sure<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.409> space<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.040> what

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
sure what to do with this space but what

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.620 
sure what to do with this space but what
I'm<00:02:02.340> thinking<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.939> doing<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.390> nothing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I'm thinking you doing is nothing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.100 
I'm thinking you doing is nothing
through<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.680> areas<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> wings<00:02:05.640> and

forming the entire first-class section

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.089 
forming the entire first-class section
rather<00:02:09.899> than<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.259> having<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> first-class

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
rather than just having the first-class

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.970 
rather than just having the first-class
section<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:12.470> limited<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.709> the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.460 
shouldn't be too hard all I need to do
is<00:03:58.379> take<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.799> edges<00:03:59.129> take<00:03:59.780> either<00:04:00.780> end<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
is take the edges take either end of the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.460 
is take the edges take either end of the
wing<00:04:01.650> here<00:04:01.919> from<00:04:02.250> about<00:04:02.579> here<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:04.200> fold

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
wing here from about here and just fold

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.400 
wing here from about here and just fold
it<00:04:04.590> down<00:04:04.620> 90<00:04:05.220> degrees<00:04:05.579> add<00:04:06.329> some<00:04:06.690> wheels<00:04:06.989> in

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
it down 90 degrees add some wheels in

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.369 
it down 90 degrees add some wheels in
here<00:04:07.889> this<00:04:08.639> through<00:04:08.970> these<00:04:09.209> sort<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.930> missile

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
here this through these sort of missile

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.960 
here this through these sort of missile
shaped<00:04:10.769> things<00:04:11.069> on<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.519> end<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:11.760> wings

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
shaped things on the end of the wings

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.640 
shaped things on the end of the wings
they<00:04:12.239> there<00:04:12.629> does<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:12.930> they<00:04:13.079> should<00:04:13.260> open<00:04:13.560> up

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
they there does like they should open up

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.900 
they there does like they should open up
and<00:04:13.889> wheels

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
and wheels

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.020 
and wheels
drop<00:04:15.359> drop<00:04:16.019> out<00:04:16.320> through<00:04:16.949> this<00:04:17.220> row<00:04:17.549> here<00:04:17.789> on

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
drop drop out through this row here on

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.259 
drop drop out through this row here on
the<00:04:18.329> edge<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:19.859> acts<00:04:20.519> as<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.760> landing

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
the edge and that acts as the landing

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.320 
the edge and that acts as the landing
gear<00:04:21.449> in<00:04:21.599> addition<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.200> another<00:04:22.680> wheel<00:04:22.979> that

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
gear in addition to another wheel that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.100 
gear in addition to another wheel that
folds<00:04:24.330> down<00:04:24.390> here

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
folds down here

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.450 
folds down here
but<00:04:26.229> yeah<00:04:26.830> it's<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.039> rather<00:04:27.219> nice-looking

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
but yeah it's a rather nice-looking

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.670 
but yeah it's a rather nice-looking
plane<00:04:27.969> I'm<00:04:28.180> rather<00:04:28.360> proud<00:04:28.659> of<00:04:28.719> that<00:04:29.020> for<00:04:29.379> a<00:04:29.409> man

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
plane I'm rather proud of that for a man

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.159 
plane I'm rather proud of that for a man
a<00:04:29.860> first<00:04:30.250> attempt<00:04:30.789> as<00:04:30.909> well<00:04:31.120> designed<00:04:31.990> on

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
a first attempt as well designed on

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.179 
a first attempt as well designed on
Excel<00:04:32.530> first<00:04:32.889> and<00:04:33.449> you<00:04:34.449> know<00:04:34.599> and<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.830> didn't

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
Excel first and you know and it didn't

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.830 
Excel first and you know and it didn't
take<00:04:36.310> out<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.759> build<00:04:36.969> actually<00:04:37.360> took<00:04:37.659> no

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
take out on the build actually took no

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.230 
take out on the build actually took no
more<00:04:38.080> than<00:04:38.199> through<00:04:38.520> three<00:04:39.520> four<00:04:39.789> hours<00:04:40.120> to

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
more than through three four hours to

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.679 
more than through three four hours to
build

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
build

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.529 
build
so<00:04:41.469> rather<00:04:42.250> quick<00:04:42.580> build<00:04:42.819> it's<00:04:43.060> just<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.389> matter

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
so rather quick build it's just a matter

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.279 
so rather quick build it's just a matter
of<00:04:43.659> getting<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.020> wings<00:04:44.259> right<00:04:44.699> but<00:04:46.169> there<00:04:47.169> we
