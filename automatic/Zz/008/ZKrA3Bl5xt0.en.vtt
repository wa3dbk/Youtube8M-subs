00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.539 

alright<00:03:03.440> as<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.530> can<00:03:04.739> see<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
alright as you can see here this is a

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.759 
alright as you can see here this is a
royal<00:03:05.880> crystals<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.900> did<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.200> replace<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
royal crystals and I did to replace it

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.520 
royal crystals and I did to replace it
had<00:03:07.920> some<00:03:08.489> crystals<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.420> went<00:03:10.109> ahead<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
had some crystals in it I went ahead and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
had some crystals in it I went ahead and
replaced<00:03:10.709> him<00:03:11.160> with<00:03:11.190> some<00:03:11.459> crystals<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.000> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
replaced him with some crystals that I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.270 
replaced him with some crystals that I
had<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.450> hand<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:14.209> what<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.329> would<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.690> this

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
had on hand and what you would do this

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.940 
had on hand and what you would do this
radio<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.430> capable<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.060> lobe<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.959> VHF<00:03:19.560> high

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
you would insert into each channel Bank

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.530 
you would insert into each channel Bank
or<00:03:30.690> into<00:03:30.959> each<00:03:31.019> channel<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.680> would<00:03:32.430> set<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
or into each channel you would set the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.340 
or into each channel you would set the
switch<00:03:33.750> accordingly<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.889> either<00:03:35.760> low<00:03:36.120> high<00:03:36.900> or

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.309 
UHF depending on which band the crystal
setup<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.630> would<00:03:42.780> switch<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.170> the

setup for and that would switch in the
appropriate<00:03:43.889> circuitry<00:03:44.760> there<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.090> notice<00:03:45.930> on

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
appropriate circuitry there I notice on

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.699 
appropriate circuitry there I notice on
my<00:03:46.170> crystals<00:03:46.769> are<00:03:46.920> aged<00:03:47.310> quite<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> bit<00:03:48.709> from

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
my crystals are aged quite a bit from

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.039 
my crystals are aged quite a bit from
doing<00:03:50.010> some<00:03:50.220> testing<00:03:50.639> here<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:51.030> lot<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.959> them

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
doing some testing here a lot of them

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.860 
doing some testing here a lot of them
seem<00:03:52.260> like<00:03:52.319> they're<00:03:52.620> off<00:03:52.769> frequency<00:03:53.870> little

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
seem like they're off frequency little

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.809 
seem like they're off frequency little
ways<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.470> they're<00:03:56.099> little<00:03:56.430> distorted

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
ways and they're little distorted

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.180 
ways and they're little distorted
sounding<00:03:57.389> so<00:03:57.599> I'm<00:03:57.690> not<00:03:57.810> sure<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.680> crickets

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
sounding so I'm not sure the crickets

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.770 
sounding so I'm not sure the crickets
the<00:03:59.280> crystals<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.880> are<00:04:00.030> off<00:04:00.180> or<00:04:00.510> the

circuitry here the capacitors that have
changed<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.209> unit<00:04:03.450> itself<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.310> I'm<00:04:05.310> going

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
changed in the unit itself but I'm going

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.890 
changed in the unit itself but I'm going
to<00:04:05.519> see<00:04:05.670> if<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.090> pull<00:04:06.359> some<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.780> those

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
to see if I can pull some of those

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.499 
to see if I can pull some of those
crystals<00:04:07.259> on<00:04:07.590> frequency<00:04:08.299> with<00:04:09.299> some

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
crystals on frequency with some

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.240 
crystals on frequency with some
capacitors<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> circuit<00:04:10.949> I<00:04:10.979> haven't

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
capacitors in the circuit I haven't

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.070 
capacitors in the circuit I haven't
analyzed<00:04:11.609> looked<00:04:12.239> at<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.479> circuit

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
analyzed looked at that circuit

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.660 
analyzed looked at that circuit
well<00:04:13.230> yet<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.560> see<00:04:13.770> what<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.130> could<00:04:14.220> do<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.430> can

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
well yet to see what I could do I can

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.460 
well yet to see what I could do I can
probably<00:04:14.850> bring<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.240> crystals<00:04:15.660> on<00:04:15.840> frequency

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
probably bring the crystals on frequency

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.850 
probably bring the crystals on frequency
with<00:04:16.650> some<00:04:17.430> tricks<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.120> capacitors<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:19.019> so

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
with some tricks with capacitors here so

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.160 
with some tricks with capacitors here so
basically<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.760> have<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> RF<00:04:21.299> input<00:04:21.420> section

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
basically you have the RF input section

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.620 
basically you have the RF input section
to<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.620> radio<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:26.150> if<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.300> can<00:04:27.390> get<00:04:27.480> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
to the radio and if I can get the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.870 
to the radio and if I can get the
lighting<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.050> little<00:04:28.140> better<00:04:28.410> here<00:04:28.680> here<00:04:29.580> we<00:04:29.730> go

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
lighting a little better here here we go

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.110 
lighting a little better here here we go
that<00:04:30.000> might<00:04:30.240> help<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:32.190> RF<00:04:32.490> input<00:04:32.640> section

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
that might help the RF input section

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.920 
that might help the RF input section
from<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.870> antenna<00:04:34.310> here<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:36.360> oscillator

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
from the antenna here in the oscillator

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.760 
from the antenna here in the oscillator
section<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.080> receiver<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.110> off<00:04:40.440> stage

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
audio amp section over on this side

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.640 
audio amp section over on this side
now<00:04:46.350> there's<00:04:46.770> an<00:04:46.980> built-in<00:04:47.400> speaker<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.650> I'll

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
now there's an built-in speaker and I'll

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.340 
now there's an built-in speaker and I'll
show<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.040> other<00:04:50.160> side<00:04:50.550> here<00:04:51.350> this

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
show you the other side here this

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.950 
show you the other side here this
transformer<00:04:53.100> is<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.220> little<00:04:53.460> loose<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:54.390> need<00:04:54.840> to

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
transformer is a little loose I need to

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.170 
transformer is a little loose I need to
tighten<00:04:55.290> up<00:04:55.380> those<00:04:55.560> screws<00:04:55.980> or<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.370> little

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
tighten up those screws or a little

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.730 
tighten up those screws or a little
looser<00:04:57.540> became<00:04:57.930> loose<00:04:58.140> over<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.530> years

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
looser became loose over the years

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.400 
looser became loose over the years
that's<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.310> power<00:04:59.520> transformer<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:01.050> convert

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
that's the power transformer to convert

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.980 
that's the power transformer to convert
the<00:05:01.560> AC<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.310> DC<00:05:02.640> voltage<00:05:03.090> needed<00:05:03.510> for<00:05:03.900> the

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
the AC to the DC voltage needed for the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.680 
the AC to the DC voltage needed for the
radio<00:05:04.410> now<00:05:05.220> over<00:05:05.760> here<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.120> looks<00:05:06.180> like<00:05:06.390> the

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
radio now over here it looks like the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.470 
radio now over here it looks like the
audio<00:05:07.080> amp<00:05:07.650> IC<00:05:08.430> has<00:05:08.700> been<00:05:09.000> replaced<00:05:09.540> before

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
audio amp IC has been replaced before

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.570 
audio amp IC has been replaced before
but<00:05:12.480> looks<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.110> solder<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.920> it<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:14.310> the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
but looks of the solder on it and the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.690 
but looks of the solder on it and the
flux<00:05:14.850> left<00:05:15.290> so<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.710> audio<00:05:17.040> amp<00:05:17.250> that's<00:05:17.400> kind

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
flux left so the audio amp that's kind

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.510 
flux left so the audio amp that's kind
of<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.850> common<00:05:18.270> thing<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:19.050> heats<00:05:19.919> up<00:05:20.160> so

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
of a common thing that heats up so

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.970 
of a common thing that heats up so
wherever<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:21.450> got<00:05:21.600> heat<00:05:21.900> it's<00:05:22.320> you're<00:05:22.800> going

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
wherever you got heat it's you're going

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.250 
wherever you got heat it's you're going
to<00:05:23.070> have<00:05:23.550> failure<00:05:24.060> there<00:05:24.270> sooner<00:05:24.630> or<00:05:24.750> later<00:05:24.870> so

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
to have failure there sooner or later so

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.350 
to have failure there sooner or later so
it<00:05:25.350> looks<00:05:25.500> like<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:25.770> been<00:05:25.890> replaced<00:05:26.360> but

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
it looks like it's been replaced but

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.270 
it looks like it's been replaced but
right<00:05:27.810> now<00:05:27.960> everything<00:05:28.260> seems<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.830> be<00:05:28.919> working

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
right now everything seems to be working

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.940 
right now everything seems to be working
fine<00:05:29.550> so<00:05:30.110> that's<00:05:32.150> that's<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.600> old<00:05:34.230> scanner

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
fine so that's that's the old scanner

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.580 
fine so that's that's the old scanner
from<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.370> 1970s<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.450> still<00:05:36.750> still<00:05:37.260> seems<00:05:37.500> to

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
from the 1970s and still still seems to

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.980 
from the 1970s and still still seems to
work<00:05:37.770> fine<00:05:38.040> they<00:05:38.280> were<00:05:38.400> built<00:05:39.000> fairly<00:05:39.450> decent

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
work fine they were built fairly decent

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:47.780 
work fine they were built fairly decent
and<00:05:40.140> held<00:05:40.890> up<00:05:41.040> good<00:05:41.370> over<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.700> years<00:05:46.790> here's

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
and held up good over the years here's

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.340 
and held up good over the years here's
the<00:05:48.060> bottom<00:05:48.390> side<00:05:48.600> of<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.840> board<00:05:49.020> there's

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
the bottom side of the board there's

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.100 
the bottom side of the board there's
that<00:05:49.620> audio<00:05:49.980> amp<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.340> was<00:05:50.430> telling<00:05:50.730> you<00:05:50.820> about

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
that audio amp I was telling you about

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.720 
that audio amp I was telling you about
soldering<00:05:52.110> doesn't<00:05:52.650> not<00:05:52.919> look<00:05:53.190> very<00:05:53.430> good<00:05:53.580> on

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
soldering doesn't not look very good on

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.550 
soldering doesn't not look very good on
there<00:05:53.880> I'm<00:05:54.060> going<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.270> take<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.020> reflow<00:05:55.320> that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
there I'm going to take and reflow that

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.880 
there I'm going to take and reflow that
clean<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:55.890> up<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:57.060> tighten<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.169> screws

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
clean that up and tighten the screws

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.060 
clean that up and tighten the screws
here<00:06:00.080> here's<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.260> row<00:06:01.380> of<00:06:01.500> crystals<00:06:01.919> is

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
here here's the row of crystals is

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.440 
here here's the row of crystals is

which<00:06:24.570> would<00:06:25.050> be<00:06:25.199> a<00:06:25.229> good<00:06:25.380> idea<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.800> replace<00:06:25.949> I

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
which would be a good idea to replace I

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.310 
which would be a good idea to replace I
would<00:06:26.580> say<00:06:27.050> fairly<00:06:28.050> aged<00:06:29.030> so<00:06:30.030> other<00:06:30.810> than<00:06:31.080> that

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
would say fairly aged so other than that

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.700 
would say fairly aged so other than that
like<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.220> say<00:06:32.400> it's<00:06:32.729> working<00:06:33.410> don't<00:06:34.410> you<00:06:34.530> just

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
like I say it's working don't you just

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.340 
like I say it's working don't you just
love<00:06:34.919> those<00:06:35.130> flashing<00:06:35.880> lights<00:06:36.120> flashing<00:06:36.960> LED

this<00:07:05.850> is<00:07:06.000> a<00:07:06.030> very<00:07:06.270> common<00:07:06.720> scanner<00:07:07.020> in<00:07:07.200> the<00:07:07.290> 70s

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
this is a very common scanner in the 70s

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.190 
this is a very common scanner in the 70s
and<00:07:07.860> 80s<00:07:07.980> and<00:07:08.340> if<00:07:08.940> you're<00:07:09.180> interested<00:07:10.170> in

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
scanners like this I also did a video

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.870 
scanners like this I also did a video
it's<00:07:12.420> done<00:07:12.630> in<00:07:12.780> my<00:07:12.870> list<00:07:13.050> of<00:07:13.200> ways<00:07:13.350> now<00:07:13.590> on<00:07:13.880> my

Bearcat Elektra Bearcat 101 and that was

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.410 
Bearcat Elektra Bearcat 101 and that was
a<00:07:19.290> synthesized<00:07:20.190> type<00:07:20.520> radio'<00:07:20.730> or

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
a synthesized type radio' or

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.720 
a synthesized type radio' or
programmable<00:07:22.020> didn't<00:07:22.830> have<00:07:22.950> to<00:07:23.130> use<00:07:23.250> crystals

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:23.730 
programmable didn't have to use crystals

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.520 
programmable didn't have to use crystals
and<00:07:23.880> that<00:07:23.970> was<00:07:24.120> a<00:07:24.150> big<00:07:24.390> thing<00:07:24.660> back<00:07:25.350> at<00:07:25.500> the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
and that was a big thing back at the

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.980 
and that was a big thing back at the
time<00:07:25.830> that<00:07:26.100> was<00:07:26.310> made<00:07:26.880> approximately<00:07:27.450> the

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
same time that this radio here was made
