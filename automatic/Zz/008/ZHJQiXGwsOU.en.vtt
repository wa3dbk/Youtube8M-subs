00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.670
 they explained to me 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.679
 a bit like using fl studio 9 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.679
 then from time to time to start 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.359
 let's start by creating 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.720
 15 loves are years 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.769
 if you have any 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.529
 the drag 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.009
 present we have dinner 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.319
 foi 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.810
 snc via 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.400
 clap 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.840
 % bit of that 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 let's take a kit 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 then let's try this chick 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 and then we start charity 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.930
 this is the fact is that the patterns of 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.320
 lip alternate is composed 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.760
 lalalal these bricks 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.010
 for these bricks they are used to make solaris sounds 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.790
 % 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.700
 list anciently be we enter all these bricks if we play 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.600
 we feel on the sea 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.200
 all these bricks 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.850
 rihanna 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.170
 or for example if we put it type 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.120
 but every 4 months 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.260
 I will play 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.610
 precisely polimi 4 bricks 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160
 for or 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.000
 if we want to save time 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.960
 eeehm 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 finally we can click on his not that we want that is kind of a gem 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 that is this 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.159
 and we click with the right button 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.760
 and then if we feel if we want a 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.470
 create a 4 state beat 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 8 state u2start 2 state would be this 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.880
 4 state would be 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 what I did see before that is soon 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 8 state enzymes would be this 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.700
 after that 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.710
 to who 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.680
 work 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.549
 let's do something fringed 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.549
 I don't call it that 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 perfect 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.969
 sorry 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 then waited wrong 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.309
 perfect 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.709
 then 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 then 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.859
 aurora 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.399
 these are the monopolies in the heart 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.029
 those on the right 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:48.569
 they are used to increase or decrease the volume 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.909
 of a sound 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.119
 % for example 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.089
 then meanwhile we don't do 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.939
 now world tattoos and make you feel only the sky that I do not play 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.299
 these other sounds so what I do is not that I delete them or the 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.119
 down the volume totally 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.420
 just click on this button 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.030
 and when it becomes gray% I'm not it was in fact show it to you 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.489
 in fact these are not just kickers 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.869
 then 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.509
 to make you understand this if I lower it to the maximum I will not play 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 if the low of the sky I raise to the maximum 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.099
 at most 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.180
 then earth ampere reset it 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.179
 as you were before it was at the beginning 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.179
 and just tweet with the right button and resort 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.640
 this other one is the one on the left 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.659
 need to play I'm here on the left when this 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.980
 so if I put it all right sunara only taastrup 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.029
 if I put it all left it will sound only to the left 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.209
 eheheh and then we do resort 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.530
 so then 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.530
 the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.739
 I'm in the stretch I spend a little 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.519
 tam after that 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.639
 for teachers to use the playlist 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.129
 then meanwhile if we want to rename rather than paternal 1 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.749
 eheheh on 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.789
 if we want to rename it 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.019
 mastar press f2 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.140
 ergo we gather random dinette we rename type or gem 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.279
 on the other side 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.900
 r after that if I want to make another glass 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.900
 where do i do this 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.839
 this is why we rename it as a bean 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.409
 % because 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.409
 this account 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 let's do like this 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.210
 finally 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.210
 in this picture 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.529
 and this 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.830
 open the playlist 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.689
 the playlist you 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.689
 It is composed of all the paternal 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:26.839
 It is composed of all the three parts of the paternal water 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.400
 so it's not like I'm always here 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.919
 that is practically this 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.779
 we can put it here 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:35.900
 and click 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.650
 standing on probes 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.600
 the demo that will appear this orange little arrow that we will need 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.469
 after 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.919
 eeee then you want to make tea play this first 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.879
 % this bit 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.949
 after this after this 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.330
 eh eh oh 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.190

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.180
 icric lapp primark 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.689
 then I'll put chick then I'll put it done 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.509
 the whole club 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.900
 and then I pair 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.669
 I want to play 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.039
 icp yours is hot together e-family I'll put everyone under each other 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.339
 % we do play 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.779
 exactly 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.569
 this is the playlist from which the playlist appeared a two-part playlist 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.099
 hernia 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.350
 this part here the part of the classes in the tracks 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.389
 the opinion letter h is the same as this can only h1 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.400
 the graphics say better 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.840
 so we can do the same thing we did here 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.969
 only that I gmail the part of the lot 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.220
 of the tracks 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.409
 of the council type perre to the voices 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.949
 % 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.889
 or 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.670
 the type for the voices I have for some others are type xii scarascia 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:03.939
 if we put it here and then we'll see you place it here 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.490
 to that 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.280
 then 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.250
 chang maybe serves terrarium will come out split the sounds 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.979
 and of this kind of dreams of this kind 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:18.520
 erna 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.560
 after that 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.840
 I have to do fast I explain to you globe this is to increase or decrease the 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.580
 pattern length 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.939
 quinny goes up to 16 years 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:31.969
 it was in fact I don't know if because there is up to 64 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:34.410
 reaches up to 16 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.449
 % 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.689
 they can do 15 and the standard apple 34 is the time 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.169
 that is 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:48.809
 I can easily reduce it from 10 to 999 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:52.189
 and 

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:53.960
 is 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.629
 and that's it 

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:00.189
 and then what else to say is the pact hernanes 

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:02.719
 then 

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:07.119
 and I know the mixer I'll explain in the next video one just write 

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:11.110
