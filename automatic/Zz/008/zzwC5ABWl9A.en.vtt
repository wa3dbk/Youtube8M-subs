pretty much what I did the dark side is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.590 
pretty much what I did the dark side is
to<00:03:49.799> actually<00:03:50.549> did<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.060> with<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.299> couple<00:03:51.540> of

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
but that's going back a little bit in

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.229 
but that's going back a little bit in
this<00:03:57.000> situation<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:58.549> would<00:03:59.549> imagine<00:03:59.880> it

free<00:05:25.430> I'm<00:05:26.150> guessing<00:05:26.750> what<00:05:27.320> they'd<00:05:27.560> do<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:28.160> mean

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
free I'm guessing what they'd do I mean

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.190 
free I'm guessing what they'd do I mean
this<00:05:28.760> is<00:05:28.820> just<00:05:28.970> my<00:05:29.500> guess<00:05:31.150> let's<00:05:32.150> assume<00:05:32.750> they

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
this is just my guess let's assume they

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.620 
this is just my guess let's assume they
do<00:05:33.260> want<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.650> make<00:05:33.770> Darksiders<00:05:34.490> free<00:05:34.820> just<00:05:35.570> for

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
do want to make Darksiders free just for

do want to make Darksiders free just for
a<00:05:35.780> moment<00:05:35.930> let's<00:05:36.380> just<00:05:36.620> go<00:05:36.800> with<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.010> notion

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
a moment let's just go with the notion

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.250 
a moment let's just go with the notion
that<00:05:37.460> they<00:05:37.670> did<00:05:38.000> that's<00:05:38.570> actually<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.050> first

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
that they did that's actually the first

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.230 
that they did that's actually the first
project<00:05:39.770> right<00:05:40.010> now<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.520> they<00:05:40.670> need<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:41.000> cash

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
project right now and they need the cash

project right now and they need the cash
for<00:05:41.630> it<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.950> fact<00:05:43.190> of<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.370> matter<00:05:43.430> is<00:05:43.850> unless

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
for it the fact of the matter is unless

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.900

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
the publisher is willing to to basically

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.380 
the publisher is willing to to basically

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.960 
in to make that game you've got to also
expect<00:05:57.320> that<00:05:57.440> people<00:05:57.980> are<00:05:58.190> going<00:05:58.700> to<00:05:58.790> want

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
expect that people are going to want

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.520 
expect that people are going to want
this<00:05:59.180> on<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.390> next<00:05:59.690> generation<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.170> consoles

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
this on the next generation of consoles

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.650 
this on the next generation of consoles
because<00:06:01.280> this<00:06:01.460> game<00:06:01.640> is<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.880> good<00:06:02.030> be<00:06:02.150> ready<00:06:02.450> for

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
because this game is a good be ready for

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.350 
because this game is a good be ready for
at<00:06:02.810> least<00:06:03.110> bare<00:06:04.010> minimum<00:06:04.490> 12<00:06:04.790> months<00:06:05.240> and

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
at least bare minimum 12 months and

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.490 
at least bare minimum 12 months and
that's<00:06:05.420> if<00:06:05.630> they've<00:06:05.810> really<00:06:06.020> rushed<00:06:06.260> it's

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
that's if they've really rushed it's

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.720 
that's if they've really rushed it's
probably<00:06:06.710> going<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:06.890> take<00:06:06.980> a<00:06:07.100> couple<00:06:07.340> of<00:06:07.460> years

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
probably going to take a couple of years

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.810 
probably going to take a couple of years
to<00:06:07.970> make<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.240> game<00:06:08.510> to<00:06:08.750> be<00:06:08.780> honest<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:10.610> that's

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
to make the game to be honest and that's

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.940 
to make the game to be honest and that's
not<00:06:11.720> accounting<00:06:12.290> for<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.500> fact<00:06:12.530> they've<00:06:12.800> got

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
not accounting for the fact they've got

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.010 
not accounting for the fact they've got
lack<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.340> staff<00:06:13.580> so<00:06:14.390> you've<00:06:14.510> got<00:06:14.540> to<00:06:14.780> assume

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
lack of staff so you've got to assume

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.600 
lack of staff so you've got to assume
that<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:15.440> next<00:06:15.680> generation<00:06:16.100> of<00:06:16.190> games<00:06:16.400> is

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
that the next generation of games is

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.980 
that the next generation of games is
actually<00:06:16.970> good<00:06:17.090> so<00:06:17.120> the<00:06:17.480> game<00:06:17.630> is<00:06:17.660> going<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:17.900> be

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
actually good so the game is going to be

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.570 
actually good so the game is going to be
with<00:06:18.170> this<00:06:18.260> next<00:06:18.740> generation<00:06:18.950> which<00:06:19.370> means

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
with this next generation which means

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.450 
with this next generation which means
they're<00:06:19.730> going<00:06:19.880> to<00:06:19.940> have<00:06:20.090> to<00:06:20.270> of<00:06:20.420> course

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
they're going to have to of course

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.800 
they're going to have to of course
remake<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.490> lot<00:06:22.850> of<00:06:22.940> their<00:06:23.060> engines<00:06:23.240> to<00:06:23.720> be

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
remake a lot of their engines to be

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.810 
remake a lot of their engines to be
quite<00:06:24.050> honest<00:06:24.440> unless<00:06:24.740> people<00:06:25.100> are<00:06:25.190> kind<00:06:25.790> of

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
quite honest unless people are kind of

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.310 
quite honest unless people are kind of
happy<00:06:26.210> I<00:06:26.240> mean<00:06:26.420> I<00:06:26.630> don't<00:06:26.660> know<00:06:26.900> what<00:06:27.020> the<00:06:27.110> state

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
happy I mean I don't know what the state

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.900 
happy I mean I don't know what the state
of<00:06:27.350> their<00:06:27.560> engine<00:06:27.920> situation<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.700> it's

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
of their engine situation is it's

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.700 
of their engine situation is it's
possible<00:06:29.060> it<00:06:29.510> would<00:06:29.690> be<00:06:29.840> easy<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.320> tack<00:06:30.680> on

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
possible it would be easy to tack on

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.150 
possible it would be easy to tack on
some<00:06:31.100> extras<00:06:31.670> but<00:06:32.300> you've<00:06:32.480> got<00:06:32.660> to<00:06:32.740> assume<00:06:33.740> an

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
some extras but you've got to assume an

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.920 
some extras but you've got to assume an
assumption<00:06:34.610> is<00:06:34.850> not<00:06:35.000> necessarily<00:06:35.540> indicative

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
assumption is not necessarily indicative

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.620 
assumption is not necessarily indicative
of<00:06:36.260> truth<00:06:36.620> but<00:06:36.890> you've<00:06:37.280> got<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:37.550> assume

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
of truth but you've got to assume

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.630 
of truth but you've got to assume
that<00:06:38.990> they<00:06:39.230> would<00:06:39.500> actually<00:06:39.710> need<00:06:40.130> to<00:06:40.370> do

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
that they would actually need to do

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.480 
that they would actually need to do
quite<00:06:40.970> a<00:06:41.000> lot<00:06:41.150> of<00:06:41.390> work<00:06:42.190> regardless<00:06:43.190> our

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
quite a lot of work regardless our

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.380 
quite a lot of work regardless our
