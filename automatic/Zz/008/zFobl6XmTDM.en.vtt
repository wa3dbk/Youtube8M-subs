00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the main reason I got is this one the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.719 
the main reason I got is this one the
second<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:39.860> second<00:01:40.860> thought<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> rare

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

to find and it goes faster and harder

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.280 
to find and it goes faster and harder
stands<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> takes<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> longer<00:01:45.780> table

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
stands well so it takes the longer table
