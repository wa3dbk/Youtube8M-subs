00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
because a little oil goes a long way and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
because a little oil goes a long way and
you<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> oil<00:01:39.840> around

you don't want all of that oil around

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:50.910 
you don't want all of that oil around
your<00:01:40.860> eyes<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.759> need<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> little<00:01:42.479> bit

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.280 

so<00:01:51.920> now<00:01:52.100> we're<00:01:52.280> gonna<00:01:52.460> move<00:01:52.700> on<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.659> olive

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.100 
so now we're gonna move on to the olive
oil<00:01:54.590> with<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.460> face<00:01:55.759> cleanser<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.780> use

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110

whatever<00:01:57.350> face<00:01:57.860> cleaner<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.460> would<00:01:58.610> normally

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
whatever face cleaner you would normally

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.960 
whatever face cleaner you would normally
use<00:01:59.149> I<00:02:00.079> prefer<00:02:00.770> using<00:02:01.070> one<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.729> has

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
there let it sit and soak the products

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.880 
there let it sit and soak the products
up<00:02:19.489> for<00:02:19.760> three<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.269> five<00:02:20.450> minutes<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.230> then

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
up for three to five minutes and then

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.280 
up for three to five minutes and then
we're<00:02:22.190> going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.519> go<00:02:22.880> ahead<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.600> wring<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.170> out

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
we're going to go ahead and wring it out

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.430 
we're going to go ahead and wring it out
and<00:02:24.620> test<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.790> didn't<00:02:26.600> like<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.840> it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
and test it out I didn't like that it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.100 
and test it out I didn't like that it
did<00:02:27.709> not<00:02:27.739> remove<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.910> lipstick<00:02:29.540> very<00:02:29.810> well

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
did not remove the lipstick very well

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.259 
did not remove the lipstick very well
which<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.380> why<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.830> also<00:02:31.220> mainly<00:02:31.700> ended<00:02:32.120> up

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
which is why I also mainly ended up

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.630 
which is why I also mainly ended up
going<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:32.750> product<00:02:33.739> which<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.340> third

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
going with product which the third

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640 
going with product which the third
solution<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.630> created<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.470> third

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
solution that I created and the third

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.309 
solution that I created and the third
solution<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.459> very<00:02:37.940> similar<00:02:38.330> there<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.290> a

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
solution is very similar there is a

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.839 
solution is very similar there is a
slight<00:02:39.709> difference<00:02:40.190> with<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.640> third

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
slight difference with the third

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.809 
slight difference with the third
solution<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.780> did<00:02:42.290> swap<00:02:42.620> out<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.190> olive<00:02:43.640> oil

about<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.090> solution<00:03:40.300> is<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.080> can<00:03:41.590> last

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
about this solution is that it can last

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.790 
about this solution is that it can last
for<00:03:42.100> up<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.640> one<00:03:43.030> year<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:44.170> will<00:03:44.290> probably<00:03:44.500> use

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
for up to one year you will probably use

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.240 
for up to one year you will probably use
it<00:03:45.220> prior<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.600> year<00:03:47.110> all<00:03:47.470> right<00:03:47.710> guys<00:03:47.920> so
