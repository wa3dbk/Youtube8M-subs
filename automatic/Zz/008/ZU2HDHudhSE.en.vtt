 new itunes radio a lot of fun 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.439

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.099

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.199
 also itunes 11 beta 1 released and 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.210
 so it is possible the new itunes 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.679
 to try preview 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.339
 the whole is so far only for 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.659
 Developer and you can itunes 11 the 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.480
 beta from connection 11 over the 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.399
 developer site so it's not for 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.120
 I want to show you a little something 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 itunes video is what you do with it 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.970

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 and yes I've been a bit 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.239
 Tested and I really think 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.580
 He is really great easy 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.439
 incomprehensible the whole thing works 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.150
 so far only with an American 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:59.150
 itunes account i am here now 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.519
 in the itunes store with the american 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.019
 account signed by me and then has 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.299
 the whole thing when you go to music here 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.130
 go and then up here under radio 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.509
 otherwise you are here with the songs and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.250
 up here are radio or video and then 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.200
 you come to the home page here 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.049
 we have a few already 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.079
 suggested music directions of 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.780
 itunes eg training and twitter so what 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.369
 i think about the twitter music f 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.659
 sometimes that is running water has 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.890
 is up to date or we still have here 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.130
 then autonet here of rich and solid 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.069
 we get something and from the double you 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.139
 to dc we have something here too 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.240
 Of course you can also create your own 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:42.979
 if you have them on the plus then you have 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.039
 here you have the possibility to become an artist 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.109
 to enter or to indicate at the customs 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.299
 and also there to search or you 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.609
 can choose the other music direction 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.549
 For example, I'll take it for me 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.579
 the video electronics and then we have 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.929
 here and there I can just to 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.509
 click from then we have the whole thing 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.490
 here if I double up here now 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.130
 daily master volume goes something 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.660
 quieter then the whole starts here too 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
 already i can do the song though here 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.250
 Buy now if I want or if 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.140
 I'm on top of this on the stars 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.590
 I'll click here then I can 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.819
 once choose that more of those songs 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.500
 be played 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.120
 or this song not at all 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.040
 should be played 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.040
 or i can do it all on my itunes 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.630
 Add wishlist to itunes and 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 then later on in the store on buy 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.910
 Of course I can stay here, too 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.130
 more songs or so on then 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.470
 I can enter differently and add 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.090
 then this really works and sec 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.990
 I have the whole dance here 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.010
 radio made which go on then 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.460
 we see the same here 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.890
 history which songs I hold of this 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.660
 year of this music direction so far 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.510
 I already liked to hear one 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.650
 Little tried and we have 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.270
 others also think about it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.110
 nice picture really like it very much 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.180
 or 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.920
 the whole design of this itunes video 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.900
 that is really very clear 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.120
 built and I just like it 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.740
 really very good to me 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.200
 however noticed that sometimes has 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.760
 you still advertise here so every ten 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.010
 minutes or so he comes here one 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.600
 small five seconds advertising that was 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.150
 new album from anyone 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.170
 came out and so on 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.570
 I do not think it's that bad 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.730
 year around is actually free 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.400
 and then, of course, then coped 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.710
 this five seconds advertising as I said 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.840
 I do not mind and yes I think so 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.880
 I'm very much in favor of this iTunes view 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.100
 Nice to see what's with us too 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.330
 but it is available in germany 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.070
 whole works really well with 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.980
 German interpreters so I can here 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.150
 I can also listen to german music 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.250
 yes also German interpretations or 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.410
 German songs are looking for one 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.390
 with it displayed and then it works 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.700
 of course as well as with the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.459
 English songs yes I would 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.950
 really great what do you think of 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.440
 itunes ray j would use that i had 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.940
 it came from yesterday before the frost and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.670

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.920
 used and I can you yes with you 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.570

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.400
 I can be interested otherwise 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.580
