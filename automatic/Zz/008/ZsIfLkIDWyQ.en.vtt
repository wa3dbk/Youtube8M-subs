 You do not see soap opera because you do not have the time. 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.980
 Why do not you call attention to one last one? 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.060

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800

 I'll take it in my pocket and pilot it 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.050
 including the very expensive 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.050
 if you count on me 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.670
 I'm going to talk about a subject that I never 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.830
 I never spoke in the middle of a 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 negotiation for the empire serrano leaked 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.880
 that I was the queen of the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.890
 empire and I took an absurd scare I 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.360
 I did not close anything with the empire. 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.940
 I'm not the battery queen of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.489
 empire is fact that I'm going back to the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.860
 Great river, the school I 'm already there. 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.540
 Five years I took so much 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.110
 youth 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.970
 but so much fucking and I gave my I gave 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.430
 I will tell you the message of the message. 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.440
 Say that I think I'm going to be alone. 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.480
 in the great river, because it is very 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.269
 hassle and every time I'm there 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.410
 in order to enjoy another trip to another 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.110
 stop the part that interests us the most 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.540
 because yesterday in instagram you said 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.970
 It could only be a friendship. It could only be 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.709
 A crazy passion, I'm not lying. 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.640
 You love me, it 's just a passion, it could be lonely. 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.989
 a friendship but it's much more than that 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.040
 but almost the phrase much more risks 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.370
 this kind of excitement I know there is 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.530
 ready 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.750
 we are never prepared for anything 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.700
 at the same time he is prepared for everything, right? 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.670
 this is the great reality because 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.280
 I have or do not have a booklet every 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.390
 one person each relationship and the relationship 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.100
 if you have to adapt if you have qq cd you 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.170

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.430
 The rest, how are we going to happen? 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.430

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.480

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.500
 Expose but there is someone I hope I 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.650

 very brave to all this mess with the 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.280
 Heart and hands I took a hit on the 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:01.550
 guy I know a shitload of life but 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.970

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.270

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.660
