00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.090
 Hello, what's my name? Forteza 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.819
 although it took 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.910
 as more than 25 years working in this sector the world the films 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.049
 exist in gyms also people think they fall within what is 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.490
 called risk populations 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.329
 and we have to take them into account because these people to come to cross 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.339
 there are people headed for lion with people's disabilities because they 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.329
 can come with the city rodas i yes that this person of these people 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.510
 they can do upper train jobs 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.810
 if any kind of problems 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
 I recommend 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.450
 understand this risk zone consult with the doctor who has led them 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.100
 Why is it always we are working much safer 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.690
 beth these people exist that is clearly clearly seen to have 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.030
 some kind of disability by the way in which we are going to help 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.679
 that can 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:02.630
 enjoy 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.920
 of gym but then there are other 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.990
 It's about people who have had past heart disease 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.790
 that costume suit that needs to proceed that has to be 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.040
 the symptoms because from the cern different sites different pathologies 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.180
 that I think the best thing to do in this case 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.110
 if they are very mild they can be locked in the process a slight knee pain 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.179
 knee pain 1 light back pain pointed out 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.619
 If important pressures are important diseases first of all 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.320
 consult with the doctor with the doctor who has brought this country to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 to this student and from there work with him, maybe with the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.380
 heart rate monitor controlling heart rate 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.119
 or maybe with the special compensatory exercises but what 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.570
 yes it is evident is that each person is to try 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.570
 within the possible in a different way 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.990
