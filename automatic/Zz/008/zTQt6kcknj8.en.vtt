00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
of the frame which is awesome because I

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.640 
of the frame which is awesome because I
thought<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.840> going<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.080> be<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> lot<00:02:23.410> harder

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
thought this is going to be a lot harder

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.050 
thought this is going to be a lot harder
than<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.070> really<00:02:24.340> would<00:02:24.520> all<00:02:25.390> right<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.850> now

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
than you really would all right so now

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.720 
than you really would all right so now
that<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.390> frame<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.660> empty<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.710> can<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:30.550> ahead

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
that the frame is empty I can go ahead

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.400 
that the frame is empty I can go ahead
and<00:02:31.360> start<00:02:32.310> measuring<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.140> putting<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
and start measuring and putting in the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.150 
and start measuring and putting in the
wires<00:02:35.830> now<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:37.300> using<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.110> found<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
wires now I'm using I found this at the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.540 
wires now I'm using I found this at the
Home<00:02:39.490> Depot<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:40.720> called<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.620> hardware<00:02:42.250> clock

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
Home Depot it's called a hardware clock

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.780 
Home Depot it's called a hardware clock
I<00:02:43.170> hope<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.320> guys<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.800> see<00:02:45.250> this

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
I hope you guys can see this

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.470 
I hope you guys can see this
it's<00:02:45.910> card<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:46.959> by<00:02:47.470> yard<00:02:47.890> guard<00:02:48.480> it's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it's card it's by yard guard it's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.100 
it's card it's by yard guard it's
hardware<00:02:50.050> cloth<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.850> 24<00:02:52.570> inches<00:02:53.050> by

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
hardware cloth and this is 24 inches by

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.640 
hardware cloth and this is 24 inches by
5<00:02:53.740> feet<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:54.730> it's<00:02:54.880> 2<00:02:55.090> feet<00:02:55.330> by<00:02:55.540> 5<00:02:55.840> feet<00:02:55.870> which<00:02:56.620> is

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
5 feet so it's 2 feet by 5 feet which is

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.190 
5 feet so it's 2 feet by 5 feet which is
actually<00:02:57.250> perfect<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.120> frame<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
actually perfect for the frame that I

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.250 
actually perfect for the frame that I
have<00:02:59.800> because<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:00.610> exactly<00:03:01.090> 2<00:03:01.420> feet<00:03:01.750> well

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
have because it's exactly 2 feet well

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.259 
have because it's exactly 2 feet well
it's<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.489> bit<00:03:03.610> more<00:03:03.730> than<00:03:03.910> 2<00:03:04.060> feet

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
it's a little bit more than 2 feet

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.509 
it's a little bit more than 2 feet
across<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.870> it'll<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.590> perfect<00:03:06.100> for<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
across but it'll be perfect for the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.310 
across but it'll be perfect for the
project<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.480> know<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.810> frame<00:03:08.050> is

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
project because I know this frame is

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.770 
project because I know this frame is
only<00:03:08.470> 3<00:03:08.860> feet<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.730> will<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.120> 2<00:03:10.330> feet<00:03:10.570> left

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
only 3 feet so I will have 2 feet left

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.880 
only 3 feet so I will have 2 feet left
over<00:03:11.200> which<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.130> okay<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:13.420> was<00:03:13.600> about<00:03:13.900> um

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
over which is okay and this was about um

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.130 
over which is okay and this was about um
I<00:03:15.209> think<00:03:16.209> with<00:03:16.750> text<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.470> was<00:03:17.620> under<00:03:18.040> $11<00:03:20.370> so

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
I think with text it was under $11 so

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.620 
I think with text it was under $11 so
now<00:03:23.140> be<00:03:23.830> careful<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:24.910> opening<00:03:25.480> it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
now be careful with this in opening it

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.259 
now be careful with this in opening it
because<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:26.590> don't<00:03:27.190> know<00:03:27.310> what<00:03:27.550> kind<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:27.970> how

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
because I don't know what kind of how

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.979 
because I don't know what kind of how
its<00:03:28.840> wrapped<00:03:29.350> up<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.160> feels<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.810> can

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
its wrapped up and it feels like you can

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.560 
its wrapped up and it feels like you can
do<00:03:32.140> some<00:03:32.380> damage<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:35.610> now<00:03:36.610> all<00:03:37.090> I'm<00:03:37.330> going<00:03:37.510> to

do is I'm not going to mess with the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.410 
do is I'm not going to mess with the
edge<00:03:47.560> as<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.130> can<00:03:48.310> see<00:03:48.519> it's<00:03:48.640> kind<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.940> folded

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
edge as you can see it's kind of folded

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.850
