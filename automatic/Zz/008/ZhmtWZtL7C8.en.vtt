00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.000 
lot further also you got quite the
cloverleaf<00:03:10.040> antenna<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:13.750> connect<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.860> is

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
cloverleaf antenna and connect what is

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.380 
cloverleaf antenna and connect what is
shown<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.340> play<00:03:16.549> with<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.910> previous<00:03:17.299> video

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
shown on play with the previous video

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.600 
shown on play with the previous video
for<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.480> one<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:21.079> all<00:03:21.890> well<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.100> good<00:03:22.310> but

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
for this one is all well and good but

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.370 
for this one is all well and good but
after<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.150> minute<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.920> use<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.760> turns<00:03:26.090> off<00:03:26.420> so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
after one minute of use it turns off so

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.310 
after one minute of use it turns off so
it's<00:03:28.310> okay<00:03:28.820> for<00:03:28.850> us<00:03:29.180> over<00:03:29.540> one<00:03:29.810> minute<00:03:30.140> and

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
it's okay for us over one minute and

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.770 
it's okay for us over one minute and
then<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.590> no<00:03:30.769> good<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.910> thought<00:03:32.540> about

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
then it's no good so I thought about

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.840 
then it's no good so I thought about
trying<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:34.130> wing<00:03:34.340> camera<00:03:34.880> from<00:03:35.180> hobbyking

again I've made the lead off by cutting
the<00:03:41.750> cable<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.989> then<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.470> did<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.540> servo<00:03:47.560> link

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
the cable and then I did a servo link

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.740 
the cable and then I did a servo link
servo<00:03:49.700> connection<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:52.190> plug<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.640> how<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.570> is

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750
