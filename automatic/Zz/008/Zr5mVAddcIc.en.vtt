00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
another battle today i have a gravity

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.560 
another battle today i have a gravity
perseus<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:09.620> storm<00:00:10.620> pegasus<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.610> start

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
perseus and storm pegasus and start

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.270 
perseus and storm pegasus and start
pegasus<00:00:12.929> seems<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.230> lot<00:00:13.349> smaller<00:00:13.710> than<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.130> my

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
pegasus seems a lot smaller than all my

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430 
pegasus seems a lot smaller than all my
other<00:00:14.309> days<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.030> think<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:15.929> he<00:00:16.320> has

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
other days I think it's because he has

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.779 
other days I think it's because he has
very<00:00:17.340> small<00:00:17.430> bottom<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:19.289> storm<00:00:19.789> storm

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
very small bottom and the storm storm

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.830 
very small bottom and the storm storm
metal<00:00:21.510> fusion<00:00:22.080> wheel<00:00:23.010> whatever<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> metal

metal fusion wheel whatever it is metal
part<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:26.099> seems<00:00:26.340> smaller<00:00:26.730> than<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
part is it seems smaller than all the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.939 
part is it seems smaller than all the
other<00:00:27.359> ones<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.730> I'm<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> gripping<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.949> Perseus
