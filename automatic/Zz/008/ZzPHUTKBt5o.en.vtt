00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.330 
trucks they don't have the rubber a lot
of<00:03:48.180> people<00:03:48.420> complain<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.810> they<00:03:49.080> break<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.709> did

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
of people complain that they break I did

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.550 
of people complain that they break I did
have<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> set<00:03:50.760> on<00:03:50.880> line<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.110> rolled<00:03:52.410> them

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
have a set on line that I rolled them

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.449 
have a set on line that I rolled them
once<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.040> they<00:03:53.130> broke<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.910> know<00:03:54.570> good

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
once and they broke but you know good

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.930 
once and they broke but you know good
they<00:03:56.459> mostly<00:03:56.760> break<00:03:57.030> from<00:03:57.300> playing<00:03:57.570> with<00:03:57.720> them

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
they mostly break from playing with them

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.810 
they mostly break from playing with them
so<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.800> mean<00:04:01.800> if<00:04:01.980> they<00:04:02.370> break<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:03.330> most<00:04:04.110> likely

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
so I mean if they break you most likely

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.240 
so I mean if they break you most likely
95%<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.940> time<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.239> did<00:04:06.390> probably<00:04:06.570> with<00:04:06.810> it

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
95% of the time you did probably with it

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.160 
95% of the time you did probably with it
here's<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> boom<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:09.150> booms<00:04:09.360> nice<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.959> like

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
here's the boom the booms nice I like

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.300 
here's the boom the booms nice I like

you know it's real good

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.500 
you know it's real good
your<00:04:25.760> quick<00:04:26.000> coupler<00:04:26.420> functions<00:04:28.330> now<00:04:29.330> it's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
your quick coupler functions now it's

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.970 
your quick coupler functions now it's
all<00:04:29.660> it's<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.840> real<00:04:30.020> quick<00:04:30.260> coupler<00:04:30.590> way<00:04:30.770> you'd

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
all it's a real quick coupler way you'd

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.610 
all it's a real quick coupler way you'd
have<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.190> say<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.660> quarter<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.810> circle<00:04:33.050> piece

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
have a say a quarter of a circle piece

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.240 
have a say a quarter of a circle piece
of<00:04:33.800> steel<00:04:34.180> bar<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.540> now<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.990> would<00:04:36.230> clip<00:04:37.070> on

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
of steel bar so now it would clip on

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.280 
of steel bar so now it would clip on
there<00:04:37.370> for<00:04:37.520> money<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.880> hold<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.180> pin<00:04:38.420> bring

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
there for money to hold the pin bring

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.320 
there for money to hold the pin bring
the<00:04:39.380> bucket<00:04:39.710> back<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.190> see<00:04:40.370> if<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.850> Pens<00:04:41.090> in

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
the bucket back and see if the Pens in

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.870 
the bucket back and see if the Pens in
test<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.870> just<00:04:42.830> one<00:04:43.010> just<00:04:43.220> clips<00:04:43.520> in<00:04:48.880> double
