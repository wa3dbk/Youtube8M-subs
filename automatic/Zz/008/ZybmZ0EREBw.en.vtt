harmonious<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.960> took<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> green<00:00:52.500> color<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.490 
put that all over my eyelids and then
quickly<00:00:54.660> realized<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> didn't<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.469> much

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
quickly realized it didn't have much

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.400 
quickly realized it didn't have much
