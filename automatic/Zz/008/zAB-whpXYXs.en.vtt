this<00:03:27.970> philosophy<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.019> you're<00:03:29.140> trying<00:03:29.319> to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
this philosophy that you're trying to

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.290 
this philosophy that you're trying to
match<00:03:29.500> these<00:03:29.680> two<00:03:29.830> guys<00:03:29.980> up<00:03:30.220> well<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.850> think

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
match these two guys up well I you think

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.360 
match these two guys up well I you think
being<00:03:32.200> big<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.709> National<00:03:33.069> Hockey<00:03:33.220> League

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
being big in the National Hockey League

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.520 
being big in the National Hockey League
it's<00:03:33.640> important<00:03:34.150> certainly<00:03:34.989> having<00:03:35.319> some

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
it's important certainly having some

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.370 
it's important certainly having some
sides<00:03:35.800> on<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.069> team<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.700> critical<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:38.080> think

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
sides on a team is critical we think

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.819 
sides on a team is critical we think
with<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.950> Larson<00:03:39.579> or<00:03:40.049> Erica<00:03:41.049> Carlson<00:03:41.739> from

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
with the Larson or Erica Carlson from

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.190 
with the Larson or Erica Carlson from
last<00:03:42.100> year<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.459> think<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.910> we<00:03:43.299> busted<00:03:43.690> good

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
last year I think that we busted good

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960 
last year I think that we busted good
offensive<00:03:44.739> right-hand<00:03:45.070> shot<00:03:45.280> defenseman<00:03:45.880> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
offensive right-hand shot defenseman I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.030 
offensive right-hand shot defenseman I
think<00:03:46.150> now<00:03:46.299> we<00:03:46.360> got<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> big<00:03:46.870> defender<00:03:47.260> plays<00:03:48.010> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
think now we got a big defender plays a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.729 
think now we got a big defender plays a
lot<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.430> minutes<00:03:48.989> certainly<00:03:49.989> be<00:03:50.170> hard<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.560> play

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
lot of minutes certainly be hard to play

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.310 
lot of minutes certainly be hard to play
against<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.760> defense<00:03:52.150> razon<00:03:52.570> we<00:03:53.140> know

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
against in the defense razon we know

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.990 
against in the defense razon we know
that<00:03:53.560> this<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.100> type<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.340> player<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.730> gives

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
that this is a type of player that gives

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.479 
that this is a type of player that gives
you<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.209> chance<00:03:55.450> every<00:03:55.840> night<00:03:55.989> in<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.170> league

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
you a chance every night in the league

you a chance every night in the league

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
that seem to show some interest but

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.479 
that seem to show some interest but
they're<00:04:20.289> just<00:04:20.410> not<00:04:20.530> enough<00:04:20.859> there<00:04:21.070> right<00:04:21.280> now

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
they're just not enough there right now

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.040 
they're just not enough there right now
