00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
charge rate is almost instantaneous when

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.740 
charge rate is almost instantaneous when
you<00:00:16.800> switch<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.310> gun<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.730> lot<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.570> people

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200 
here and I'm going to get outnumbered
and<00:00:37.649> overrun<00:00:38.010> pretty<00:00:38.280> quickly<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.850> drop

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and overrun pretty quickly so I drop

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
and overrun pretty quickly so I drop
back<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.379> course<00:00:40.590> people<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:41.010> fixated<00:00:41.370> on

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
back and of course people get fixated on

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
back and of course people get fixated on
their<00:00:41.760> kills<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.629> guy<00:00:42.750> chases<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:43.290> down<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
their kills so this guy chases me down I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.310 
their kills so this guy chases me down I
swap<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> BAM<00:00:45.020> instantaneous<00:00:46.020> charge

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
swap to it BAM instantaneous charge

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
swap to it BAM instantaneous charge
makes<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.219> clean<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.850> kill

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
makes it so that I can clean up the kill

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060 
makes it so that I can clean up the kill
pretty<00:00:48.329> quickly<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.440> happens<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
pretty quickly now this happens all the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.010 
pretty quickly now this happens all the
time<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.850> PvP<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:53.420> basically<00:00:54.420> when<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> review

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
time in PvP so basically when I review

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the plan C ability the charge rate on

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
the plan C ability the charge rate on
this<00:01:10.470> thing<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.890> straight-up<00:01:11.220> redonk<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> dog

it's a fusion rifle fusion rifles tend
to<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.439> pretty<00:01:46.470> well<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.920> PvP<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.970> kind

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to do pretty well in PvP it's just kind

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
to do pretty well in PvP it's just kind
of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.720> right<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
of the way that is right now so way the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.310 
of the way that is right now so way the
game<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> balanced<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:51.479> not<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.110> looking

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
game is balanced I will not just looking

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
game is balanced I will not just looking
at<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:52.770> sometimes<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> forget

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
at that right there sometimes you forget

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.359 
at that right there sometimes you forget
that<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.930> charges<00:01:55.110> instantaneously<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> came

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that it charges instantaneously it came

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.679 
that it charges instantaneously it came
around<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> corner<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.060> started<00:01:57.420> charging

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
around the corner and I started charging

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.270 
around the corner and I started charging
early<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:58.920> anticipating

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
early because you know I'm anticipating

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.730 
early because you know I'm anticipating
the<00:01:59.850> longer<00:02:00.180> charger<00:02:00.630> e<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.409> went<00:02:01.530> off

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the longer charger e but it went off

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.170 
the longer charger e but it went off
immediately<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.490> totally<00:02:02.729> missed<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
immediately and I totally missed so I

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
immediately and I totally missed so I
had<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.360> start<00:02:03.630> recharging<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.259> again<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
had to start recharging it again so you

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.709 
had to start recharging it again so you
kind<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.030> mindful<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.659> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
kind of do have to be mindful of that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.029 
kind of do have to be mindful of that
when<00:02:07.049> you're<00:02:07.170> switching<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> gun<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
when you're switching to the gun that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.859 
when you're switching to the gun that
it's<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> fire<00:02:08.700> instantaneously<00:02:09.690> if

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it's going to fire instantaneously if

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
it's going to fire instantaneously if
you<00:02:09.959> pull<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> trigger<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.459> anyways<00:02:11.730> how<00:02:11.760> does

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you pull the trigger so anyways how does

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
you pull the trigger so anyways how does
it<00:02:12.180> stack<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.629> PvP

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it stack up in PvP

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490 
it stack up in PvP
so<00:02:14.069> pretty<00:02:14.400> darn<00:02:14.760> well<00:02:14.910> hipfire<00:02:15.840> accuracy<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so pretty darn well hipfire accuracy is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.729 
so pretty darn well hipfire accuracy is
good<00:02:16.740> for<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.690> first<00:02:18.690> skill<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.349> unlock

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
good for the first skill that you unlock

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.100 
good for the first skill that you unlock
with<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.040> gun<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.270> hipfire<00:02:21.450> accuracy<00:02:21.810> is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
with this gun so the hipfire accuracy is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
with this gun so the hipfire accuracy is
good<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.950> good<00:02:23.190> down<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.489> sights<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.910> well

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
good it's good down the sights as well

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.710 
good it's good down the sights as well
it<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.920> one-shot<00:02:26.160> enemies<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.270> close<00:02:27.569> range

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it can one-shot enemies in close range

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.000 
it can one-shot enemies in close range
pretty<00:02:28.349> consistently<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.450> you'll<00:02:30.450> see<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
pretty consistently as you'll see so

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.330 
pretty consistently as you'll see so
yeah<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.640> fantastic<00:02:33.270> PvP<00:02:33.870> weapon<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
yeah it's a fantastic PvP weapon it I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.550

would<00:02:36.150> take<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.360> over<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> pocket<00:02:37.080> infinity

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
would take it over the pocket infinity

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.309 
would take it over the pocket infinity
not<00:02:38.489> because<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.030> necessarily<00:02:39.840> better<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
not because it's necessarily better I

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.300
