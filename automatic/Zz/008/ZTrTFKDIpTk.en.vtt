him he was just in he was actually in
stealth<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> whole<00:02:04.320> time<00:02:04.619> forty<00:02:05.189> fifty

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
stealth for the whole time forty fifty

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.639

his collective is just going to be
kicking<00:02:55.530> himself<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:57.200> getting<00:02:58.200> saps<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.709> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
kicking himself for getting saps in that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.650 
kicking himself for getting saps in that

situation for being out of combat for

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.229 
situation for being out of combat for
what<00:03:00.810> two<00:03:01.140> seconds<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.400> was<00:03:02.520> enough<00:03:02.820> for

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
what two seconds and that was enough for

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.140 
what two seconds and that was enough for
realz<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.989> take<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> opportunity<00:03:05.040> here<00:03:05.910> it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
realz to take the opportunity here it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850 
realz to take the opportunity here it
was<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:06.510> reals<00:03:06.720> actually<00:03:07.020> only<00:03:07.170> did<00:03:07.350> 5k

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
was but reals actually only did 5k

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.120 
was but reals actually only did 5k
damage<00:03:08.340> yeah<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> mean<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.080> still<00:03:10.320> think<00:03:10.560> yeah

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
damage yeah so I mean I still think yeah

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
to come out so both of these roads

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.130 
to come out so both of these roads
weren't<00:03:20.910> really<00:03:21.150> involved<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.780> what<00:03:21.930> went
