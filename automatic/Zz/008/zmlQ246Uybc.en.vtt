00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello so today it's not 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.290
 difficult we will make royal ice 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.090
 it's this little cream that helps 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.000
 garnish the cakes yes the last cake 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.800
 so for that I took 100 g of sugar 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 ice cream 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 an egg white and lemon so that's 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.730
 very simple in the icing sugar in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.880
 allow the egg white and we come 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.880
 mix 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 so you see 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:56.699
 we just add a few drops of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:01:00.719
 very little lemon so this cream you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.100
 can custodian cakes in icing this 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.259
 that you want if you do not use 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.789
 immediately you shoot against 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:11.060
 you film you put the film in 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:13.080
 contact of two of the ice cream 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 and and leave you at temperature 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 ambient in your kitchen so no 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.940
 like that sugar a vga porteurs and 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.179
 you can also if you want 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.429
 how to say with dyes 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.209
 food so for that matter it's this 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:38.130
 that I'm going to do I'm going to take 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:40.020
 many i'm going m if you want it a 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 a little thicker so you add a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.399
 little icing sugar of course you have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.909
 understood the system me there I find it 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:54.829
 very well so I 'm going to put a little 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.829
 make you show to put blue 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:08.000
 and the sweat swear club I have the yellow 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:27.140
 see you make beautiful decorations 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:27.430
 then I have the blue and there we will have the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.630
 red 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:37.299
 so after we can make mixtures and 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:41.049
 co2 of colors so it makes a rose 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:46.420
