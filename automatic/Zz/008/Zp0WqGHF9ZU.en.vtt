00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.360
 good morning to all new makeup 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.160
 tutorial as you can easily guess 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.010
 this is my proposal for halloween 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.530
 and it's a witch vamp bar trick 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.420
 however it has a very simple look 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.490
 I used very few products and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.279
 surely they are products that all of us 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.429
 we have at home so without having to 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.619
 going crazy will find products 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.330
 details is a very simple look 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.880
 precisely and is perfect for those who 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.680
 evening will have little time maybe come home 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.989
 from work and in no time at all 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.780
 make an impact look so it takes 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.910
 something easy to do in 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.559
 very little time you will be ready but it is al 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.410
 same time perfect for those who do not love 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.899
 those excessive tricks or in any case those 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 tricks and there are scenic destinations like 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.180
 for example severe cuts wounds burns 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.550
 on the face the only halloween rule 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.289
 and exaggerate don't be afraid of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.149
 overdo it with makeup and not 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.399
 worry about the nuances because not 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.050
 it is absolutely important therefore vi 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.460
 I leave to the tutorial I hope this 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 trick you like it and see you at 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.500
 next video hello 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.119
 Let's start immediately with the face and we must 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 going to lighten ours a lot 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 embodied so we can take or a 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.060
 foundation of some shades more 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.409
 clear 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.290
 or we can go get one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.430
 powder like this white and I go to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.430
 take it with a bristle brush 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
 compact and bathe the brush so that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.119
 will be much much clearer than 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 what in reality is because in reality 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.440
 it is a transparent powder 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.750
 or if we have nothing of everything 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.330
 that at home lets go get a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 opaque white eyeshadow 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.060
 we certainly all have this e 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.060
 go to a use like a face powder 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 ok now comes the fun part because 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 we pass to the eyes and we go to spend 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 a base is quite dark in this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 case I use this cream eye shadow 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.750
 burgundy color 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.070
 and so already they are quite scary 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.750
 but let's go on to enrich a little more 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.470
 the trick I'm going to take this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.030
 palettes of diego from the palm and in the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.150
 I'm going to get this specific 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.970
 beautiful burgundy color completely 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.360
 crazy and with the same brush I go to 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:40.290
 pass it over our eyeshadow in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:44.120
 cream blending more upwards but 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.120
 without being precise 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.130
 now I'm going to blur the contours of the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.860
 trick bringing this color to 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.700
 high and blending well on the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.700
 lower bank 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.190
 now let's darken the outer corner 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.470
 just because this trick is not 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.090
 strong enough so I go to 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.410
 take this from the same palette 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.920
 dark opaque violet always with the same 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.000
 harbor brush at the outer corner e 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.000
 in the fold 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.320
 now take a black pencil and go to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.430
 apply it as an eyeliner e 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.430
 also in the inner rim of the eye 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.570
 now I take a brush with which I have 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.440
 applied eye shadows and go to 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.440
 spread 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.130
 now I'm going to apply the mascara e 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.120
 also wanting a nice pair of eyelashes with 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.680
 inter see this result that you should 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.620
 then get this look a lot 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.070
 tired a nice but heavy makeup 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.540
 let's make it even darker 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.790
 going to fill the eyebrows if 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.410
 you have apple clear eyebrows me 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.390
 I recommend you go and discover them with a 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.160
 brand or dark brown, even black 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.410
 because this will really help to 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.600
 darken the look very much I go to 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:22.310
 use a black eyeshadow of course 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:23.720
 opaque ok do not get scared and this the 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.950
 result I also went to 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.960
 make it a little more expert 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.180
 eyebrows because in my opinion from a 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 most bad result 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.840
 now I'm going to pick up the brush with 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.440
 which I spent the first amount on going to 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.070
 pick up some powder and step into it 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.560
 this area where they could be 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.850
 fallen 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.260
 in short, the eye shadows for the rest of the 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.250
 face we might as well leave it like this 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.480
 therefore this cadaverous incarnate 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.060
 or send this to apply a little 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.240
 of blush I in this case want to go 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.650
 to apply them I choose this rose a lot 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.810
 clear completely opaque and I go to 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.160
 apply it as if it were a bronze 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.160
 only under the cheekbone 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.370
 now let's pass the lips idv two 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.590
 both very strong alternatives then 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.600
 is a look that catches the eye is 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.330
 on the eyes than on the lips 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.820
 the first option this purple lipstick 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:36.290
 this is a max lipstick and i go to 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:37.790
 apply it if it is not very dark and 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.830
 this is the result with lipstick 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.910
 purple now that I want to offer you a 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.900
 alternative or this red lipstick 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.970
 completely but this is the result 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.490
 final with pink lips I really like 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.410
 but let me know if you prefer 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.420
 purple lips or lips like me 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.370
