00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
it every single time and also what's
good<00:03:56.580> about<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.630> can<00:03:57.780> flip<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.290> play

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
good about it is you can flip the play

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.810 
good about it is you can flip the play
as<00:03:58.680> well<00:03:59.989> which<00:04:00.989> then<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.860> does<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.310> it

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
as well which then what that does is it

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.490 
as well which then what that does is it
puts<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.270> on<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.390> other<00:04:03.600> side<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.080> can<00:04:04.260> take

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
puts it on the other side so I can take

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.040 
puts it on the other side so I can take
Johnson<00:04:05.070> put<00:04:05.670> him<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> fade<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.570> then<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.900> can

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
Johnson put him on a fade and then I can

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.430 
Johnson put him on a fade and then I can
just<00:04:07.200> hit<00:04:08.300> Golden<00:04:09.300> Tate<00:04:09.480> but<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.989> doesn't<00:04:10.260> work

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
just hit Golden Tate but it doesn't work

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.640 
just hit Golden Tate but it doesn't work
because<00:04:10.650> Golden<00:04:11.190> Tate<00:04:11.510> isn't<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.750> tall<00:04:13.410> wide

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
because Golden Tate isn't a tall wide

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.970 
because Golden Tate isn't a tall wide
receiver<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.160> that's<00:04:14.310> why<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.820> have

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
receiver so that's why you have to have

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.140 
receiver so that's why you have to have
preferably<00:04:16.980> guys<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.430> Calvin<00:04:17.940> Johnson

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
preferably guys like Calvin Johnson

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.220 
preferably guys like Calvin Johnson
stuff<00:04:18.660> like<00:04:18.840> that

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
stuff like that

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.740 
stuff like that
there<00:04:19.739> he<00:04:20.549> goes<00:04:20.730> up<00:04:20.880> between<00:04:21.120> two<00:04:21.390> defenders

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
there he goes up between two defenders

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.880 
there he goes up between two defenders
again<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.940> he<00:04:23.940> gets<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.660> that's<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.740> most

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
again and he gets it so that's the most

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.770 
again and he gets it so that's the most
effective<00:04:26.430> way<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.640> do<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
effective way to do it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.190 
effective way to do it
fade<00:04:27.930> your<00:04:28.080> outside<00:04:28.500> wide<00:04:28.740> reciever<00:04:30.200> doesn't

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
have to be out with five wide you can do

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.600 
have to be out with five wide you can do
it<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.790> almost<00:04:33.210> any<00:04:34.100> formation<00:04:35.100> as<00:04:35.430> long

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
it out of almost any formation as long

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.820

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
the opposite side is on a fade route and

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.980 
the opposite side is on a fade route and
then<00:04:41.790> just<00:04:42.000> bullet<00:04:42.300> past<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.720> you'll<00:04:42.840> get

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
then just bullet past and you'll get

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.440 
then just bullet past and you'll get
this<00:04:43.110> animation<00:04:44.930> most<00:04:45.930> often<00:04:46.440> than<00:04:46.620> not<00:04:46.650> so

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
this animation most often than not so
