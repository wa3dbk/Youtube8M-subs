Hello and welcome to another of Creative
Bloq's two minute tools skills.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.759
Today we're going to be looking at photoshop
and specifically the type mask tool.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.000
Now the tool can be found in the tools panel 
over here alongside the normal type tool.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You'll see we have the horizontal and vertical type tool
and the horizontal and vertical type mask tool.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And while the normal type tool allows you to add text,
the type mask tool works slightly differently.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.340
It allows you to create text and then turn that text
into an active selection.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.309
So I'm using the horizontal tool for this
video.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.270
The vertical tool works in a very similar way, the only 
difference between the two being that

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.500
the horizontal tool allows you to type from left to right, 
the vertical tool works from top to bottom.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.420
With the tool selected you can see that we have these options 
here at the top of the screen that allows us to customise the type.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.330
We can choose from a list of different fonts. I'm
just using Verdana. 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.860
We can set a font style, we can change the size, 
we can choose different alignment options,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.610
and we can also check this icon here to toggle the
paragraph and character panels on and off.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.180
So I'm just going to choose a slightly larger font size then, 
I just need to click anywhere within the document to start my letters.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.180
And then obviously I can highlight the letters, I can change 
the alignment, I can go to my panels for further options.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.030
I can also, let's just click off there, hold command or
control and you can see that it temporarily gives me a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.370
bounding box around the edge. And I can click on the bounding
box and resize the letters just like this.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.250
So I want them to fill the frame, so I'm just going to
make them nice and big.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.090
And then once you're happy with the position and font-style
and everything else, you can simply click off the tool

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.750
onto another tool, to turn the type into an active selection
like that. 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.760
And then you can make any changes that you want with that selection.
So for example here you can see if I bring up my layers panel

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.070
how I have my graffiti image above a simple background.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.389
I'm going to turn that selection into a layer mask by clicking
the add layer mask icon

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:17.120
and perhaps I'm going to add some depth by double clicking the
layer here and adding a drop shadow. Drag that down.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.469
So there you go, you can see how quick and easy it is to create 
really interesting text effects using the horizontal type mask tool.
