00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.450
 Well now I 'm going to show you some of 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.809
 the fixers that I have that I have gone 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.809
 buying 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.770
 I know that while it is difficult to get it 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.710
 in the market if anyone knows of 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.890
 although you can get either 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.990
 resin 8 is like that 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.230
 and obviously the resin is not the same 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.750
 they are better so aluminum but good 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.470
 now I'm going to tell you what I have 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.240
 to make the peach blossom 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.340
 the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.340
 the mistletoe leaf or the flower of 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 of our be federal 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 the poppy adriÃ¡n to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.989
 face 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 the vine leaf the strawberry back 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.290
 orchid the router of the method of 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.180
 sunflower 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 the seven-pointed daisy in fact 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.350
 the key 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.860
 the malaga leaf comes 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.860
 the smallest the little rose 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.420
 the cypress leaf 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.080
 and saved from the magnolia 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.130
 the purpose of giving the child 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.899
 the petal of a girl rose 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.899
 the petal of a large rose 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.950
 this is a tiny flower 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.260
 this is the Venus flower that is very 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.610
 pretty is on the blade of the stick that 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.610
 It serves to make the same flower 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.600
 and I think not 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.180
 I tell you that with the curler of the 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.429
 face can be made large leaves 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.530
 with the poppy fixative also 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.410
 You can make another type of petals up 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 leaves because they take the form for more than 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.670
 we put a petal take the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.330
 form of what is the healing of frizz 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 Then, for example, with the sheet with 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.030
 this with the magnolia fixer it 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.760
 can do 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.990
 leaves also because they stay that way 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.990
 facets and they are very beautiful 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.379
 then with the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.180
 with the universal blade fixer is 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.879
 according to the format of the sheet that one 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.120
 give it if it makes it finite it takes the 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.900
 relief of what the sheet has as well as 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.909
 it's like in all 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.610
 It can be used for various things 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.069
 these the sunflower but it also serves 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.140
 to do the homework 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.530
 and if one also wanted to be leaves 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.749
 finite because when putting each sheet it takes 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.340
 take the format of what the drawing that 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.340
 has the mold
