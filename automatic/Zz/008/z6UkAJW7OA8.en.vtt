the<00:00:22.359> first<00:00:22.599> thing<00:00:22.840> you<00:00:22.960> want<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.199> do<00:00:23.349> is<00:00:23.650> create

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
the first thing you want to do is create

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.710 
the first thing you want to do is create
a<00:00:24.039> simple<00:00:24.490> drawing<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:25.029> what<00:00:25.329> you<00:00:25.449> want<00:00:25.630> to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
a simple drawing of what you want to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.929 
a simple drawing of what you want to
illustrate<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:27.189> we're<00:00:27.310> going<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.460> do<00:00:27.669> here

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
illustrate what we're going to do here

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.060 
illustrate what we're going to do here
is<00:00:28.090> open<00:00:28.300> up<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.660> new<00:00:28.840> document<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.470> place<00:00:30.039> a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
is open up a new document and place a

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.729 
is open up a new document and place a
scan<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:31.060> I<00:00:31.090> have<00:00:31.390> of<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.960> original<00:00:32.410> drawing

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
scan that I have of the original drawing

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.270 
scan that I have of the original drawing
that<00:00:32.949> I<00:00:33.010> made<00:00:33.100> for<00:00:33.519> this<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.680> still<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.010> very

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
that I made for this it's still a very

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.640 
that I made for this it's still a very
rough<00:00:36.610> sketch<00:00:36.790> it's<00:00:37.329> basically<00:00:37.690> just<00:00:37.839> created

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
rough sketch it's basically just created

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.560 
rough sketch it's basically just created
so<00:00:39.010> that<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.250> can<00:00:39.489> get<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.790> shapes<00:00:40.059> right<00:00:40.210> and

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
so that I can get the shapes right and

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.040 
so that I can get the shapes right and
some<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.260> shadows<00:00:41.710> how<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:41.949> want<00:00:42.309> them<00:00:43.050> once

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
some of the shadows how I want them once

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.869 
some of the shadows how I want them once
I<00:00:44.230> have<00:00:44.409> that<00:00:44.440> done<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.980> place<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.460> piece<00:00:45.699> of

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
I have that done I place a piece of

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.270 
I have that done I place a piece of
tracing<00:00:46.150> paper<00:00:46.329> or<00:00:46.809> vellum<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.470> top<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:48.100> that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
tracing paper or vellum on top of that

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.520 
tracing paper or vellum on top of that
image<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:48.790> using<00:00:49.539> several<00:00:49.809> different<00:00:49.960> size

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
image and using several different size

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.770 
image and using several different size
markers<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.280> pens<00:00:51.579> I'll<00:00:51.910> trace<00:00:52.390> over<00:00:52.629> the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
markers and pens I'll trace over the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.500 
markers and pens I'll trace over the
original<00:00:53.379> image<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:53.920> refine<00:00:54.489> it<00:00:54.520> and<00:00:54.820> create

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
original image and refine it and create

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.330 
original image and refine it and create
something<00:00:55.930> that's<00:00:56.079> closer<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.649> what<00:00:57.039> I<00:00:57.070> want

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
something that's closer to what I want

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.740 
something that's closer to what I want
to<00:00:57.430> end<00:00:57.579> up<00:00:57.760> with<00:00:58.000> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:01.000> next<00:01:01.120> stage<00:01:01.480> I

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
to end up with in the next stage I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.350 
to end up with in the next stage I
repeat<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.350> process<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:03.070> refine<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.030> image

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
repeat the process and refine the image

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.290 
repeat the process and refine the image
even<00:01:04.570> more<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:08.259> image<00:01:08.679> now<00:01:09.130> has<00:01:09.160> sharp<00:01:09.759> clear

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
even more the image now has sharp clear

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.529 
even more the image now has sharp clear
defined<00:01:10.960> edges<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:12.580> is<00:01:12.610> exactly<00:01:13.179> what<00:01:13.450> we

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
defined edges which is exactly what we

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.919 
defined edges which is exactly what we
need<00:01:13.780> for<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.080> next<00:01:14.229> step<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:16.720> we're<00:01:16.840> going

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
need for the next step now we're going

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.260 
need for the next step now we're going
to<00:01:16.990> use<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.380> trace<00:01:17.649> program<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.369> Illustrator

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
to use the trace program in Illustrator

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.960

top<00:01:24.549> of<00:01:24.700> your<00:01:24.850> screen<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.009> good<00:01:27.159> idea<00:01:27.310> to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
top of your screen it's a good idea to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
top of your screen it's a good idea to
experiment<00:01:28.329> with<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.570> different<00:01:28.600> options

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
experiment with the different options

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.219 
experiment with the different options
under<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.009> trace<00:01:30.400> program<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.810> works<00:01:32.020> for

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
under the trace program what works for

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.410 
under the trace program what works for
my<00:01:32.320> particular<00:01:32.890> drawing<00:01:33.159> may<00:01:33.880> not<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.240> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
my particular drawing may not be the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.780 
my particular drawing may not be the
best<00:01:34.600> option<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.079> yours

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
best option for yours

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.100 
best option for yours
there's<00:01:36.790> also<00:01:37.000> an<00:01:37.270> option<00:01:37.600> at<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.780> bottom

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
there's also an option at the bottom

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.830 
there's also an option at the bottom
called<00:01:38.320> tracing<00:01:38.860> options<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:40.299> allows<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
called tracing options this allows you

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.980 
called tracing options this allows you
to<00:01:40.869> manually<00:01:41.409> change<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.100> various<00:01:42.670> settings

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.719 

for<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.140> particular<00:01:47.680> image<00:01:47.890> I'll<00:01:48.280> use<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
for this particular image I'll use the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.289 
for this particular image I'll use the
default<00:01:49.060> settings<00:01:50.219> so<00:01:51.219> all<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.460> have<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.880> do<00:01:52.030> is
