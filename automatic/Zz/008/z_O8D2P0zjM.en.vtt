00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.459
 hello today we are going to learn how to do 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.000
 canapÃ©s with face goodbye I hope that you 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.980
 like 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.100
 to make our eyes we are going to 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.020
 need a slice of bread that is 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 integral will be even better because 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.869
 it will have a more brownish color 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.750
 cream chocolate brown 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.990
 dark and a little butter or 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.170
 margarine and a banana 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.510
 first we will put the slice of bread in 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.300
 the toaster so that it looks 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.760
 still a little bit more brunette 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.760
 you do not have to stay just a little 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:52.710
 the second step is to join 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 a little bit of margarine or butter 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.950
 it's important that we wash with the bread 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.500
 hot so that it is founded and we 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.890
 help get that look more 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.740
 yellowish but not whitish and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.550
 we should also spread the good 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.030
 and as you see the bread the slice already goes 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.970
 absorbing and that yellowish tone remains 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.930
 what was being talked about 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.600
 in third place we are going to catch the banana 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.540
 obviously we are going to peel it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.799
 and what we are going to do is break it into 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.799
 small slices 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.530
 and so they are round slices 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.890
 Well, as you can see, we have already cut the 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.220
 banana in strips three in the center that 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 are the little pieces that remain the circle 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.640
 wider we're going to take one and we're going to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.310
 place in the center of the bread so that 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.159
 be our snout 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.740
 then we are going to take two more 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.220
 chubs 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.600
 chunks 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.900
 Y 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.390
 we are going to separate from the rest and these 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.160
 will make the ears where it is 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.470
 so they are not superimposed like that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.020
 fit perfectly with the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 bread and what we're going to do is make them 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.900
 small cuts 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.400
 and with the knife we make 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.450
 another small cut 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.980
 as you see at a 90 degree angle and 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.980
 it will be the other little ear 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.280
 as you see we have decided 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.959
 recreating the rest of the banana because 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.530
 we will use to do to make 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.989
 in the cic and the little ears of others 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.720
 toasts of other teddy bears then the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.370
 The last step we have left is to make 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.290
 our bear the little eyes and the mouth to 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.260
 what we are going to use is the cream 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.510
 of cocoa is worth then let's catch with 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 the tip of the knife a little bit 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.220
 very very tiny piece and what 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.960
 let's deposit 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.950
 about the banana that is the snout is worth 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.950
 very careful 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.620
 and we try to give it a little bit of shape 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.830
 that would be the mouth of our 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.629
 then we'll take another little bit and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.629
 let's make her eyes 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.350
 this step can be a tad more 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.500
 complicated 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.010
 because being butter makes 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.280
 the bread does not absorb so well so 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.250
 easily 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.850
 the chocolate cream but if we do 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.850
 with careful 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.849
 you will see 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.740
 how it's going well, as you see 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.410
 here we would have our appetizer 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.570
 snack with face of os that is 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.100
 perfect to do with children because 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.780
 as you can see how you could see no 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.930
 have any kind of difficulty 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.150
 and the result will help the children 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.560
 as the fruit if you liked it you can 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.820
 subscribe to our father channel 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.820
 very easy on youtube
