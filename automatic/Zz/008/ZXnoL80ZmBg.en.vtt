Auto twins and these all affect the way
the<00:00:14.219> keyboard<00:00:14.820> works<00:00:15.059> auto<00:00:15.540> twins

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the keyboard works auto twins

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.590 
the keyboard works auto twins
automatically<00:00:16.379> inserts<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.859> closing<00:00:17.400> pair<00:00:17.670> of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
automatically inserts a closing pair of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.570 
automatically inserts a closing pair of
parentheses<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.500> instance<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.400> auto

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
parentheses for instance you have auto

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.160 
parentheses for instance you have auto
space<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.240> inserts<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> space

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
space which inserts the space

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.200 
space which inserts the space
automatically<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.010> selected<00:00:23.550> keys<00:00:23.850> and

automatically with selected keys and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.939 
automatically with selected keys and
then<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:24.900> jumping<00:00:25.350> keys<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
then you have jumping keys which is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
then you have jumping keys which is
really<00:00:26.189> interesting<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.849> show<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> app

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
below I have Auto twins enable now so if

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
below I have Auto twins enable now so if
I<00:00:35.640> put<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> parenthesis<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.020> see

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I put a parenthesis in there you can see

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
I put a parenthesis in there you can see
it<00:00:37.530> automatically<00:00:38.129> pairs<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it automatically pairs it with the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.970 
it automatically pairs it with the
closing<00:00:39.239> parenthesis<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.410> same<00:00:40.620> thing<00:00:40.800> goes

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
closing parenthesis the same thing goes

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.350 
closing parenthesis the same thing goes
with<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> brackets<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> want<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> put

with the brackets if you want to put

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 
with the brackets if you want to put
brackets<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:43.219> like<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
brackets in there like that it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.850 
brackets in there like that it
automatically<00:00:45.149> pair<00:00:45.390> those<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.750> well<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
automatically pair those as well so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.090 
automatically pair those as well so
really<00:00:47.219> interesting<00:00:48.030> jailbreak<00:00:48.960> tweak<00:00:49.620> not

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
really interesting jailbreak tweak not

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
really interesting jailbreak tweak not
that's<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> auto<00:00:50.760> twins<00:00:51.180> section<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.809> adult

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
then you have the ! so if I put one of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
then you have the ! so if I put one of
those<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.660> automatic<00:01:04.650> space

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
those in you can see automatic space

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
those in you can see automatic space
after<00:01:05.220> those<00:01:05.640> items<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.630> course

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
after those items and you can of course

after those items and you can of course
put<00:01:07.260> any<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> those<00:01:07.650> symbols<00:01:08.070> configure<00:01:08.700> any

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
put any of those symbols configure any

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
put any of those symbols configure any
of<00:01:09.060> those<00:01:09.150> symbols<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:10.890> jumping<00:01:11.640> keys

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
of those symbols do so now jumping keys

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
of those symbols do so now jumping keys
this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> where<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.500> week<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:14.010> gets

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this is where this week really gets

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
this is where this week really gets
interesting<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.760> really<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.150> guess<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
interesting this is really I guess you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.149 
interesting this is really I guess you
could<00:01:15.780> say<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> meat<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> potatoes<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
could say the meat and potatoes of the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
could say the meat and potatoes of the
tweet<00:01:17.369> jumping<00:01:17.790> keys<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.390> cool

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
tweet jumping keys it's really cool

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
tweet jumping keys it's really cool
because<00:01:18.950> what<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.100> allows<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because what this allows you to do is to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
because what this allows you to do is to
force<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> keyboard<00:01:22.619> back<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> alphabet

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
force the keyboard back to the alphabet

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
force the keyboard back to the alphabet
after<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.390> insert<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> certain<00:01:25.110> character

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
after you insert a certain character

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
after you insert a certain character
nail<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.130> only<00:01:26.490> normally<00:01:27.150> works<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
nail this only normally works with the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.710 
nail this only normally works with the
apostrophe<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.759> notice<00:01:30.060> even<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> stock
