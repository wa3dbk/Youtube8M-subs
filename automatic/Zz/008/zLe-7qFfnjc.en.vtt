00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
looks a little weak in my opinion not

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.539 
looks a little weak in my opinion not
very<00:01:53.439> good<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.649> lot<00:01:53.979> of<00:01:54.100> these<00:01:54.159> cardboard

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.020

so<00:02:29.630> they<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.530> can<00:02:30.680> see<00:02:30.890> exactly<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.550> mean

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
so they you can see exactly what I mean

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.240 
so they you can see exactly what I mean
it<00:02:32.480> isn't<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.990> very<00:02:33.020> secure<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:34.040> would

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it isn't a very secure but I would

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.580 
it isn't a very secure but I would
recommend<00:02:34.490> it<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.750> steerer<00:02:36.230> figure

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
recommend it for the steerer figure

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.100 
recommend it for the steerer figure
alone<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.460> set<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:38.000> definitely<00:02:38.570> not

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
alone but the set is definitely not

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.800 
alone but the set is definitely not
worth<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.740> purchase<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.490> will<00:02:41.180> carry<00:02:41.360> guy<00:02:41.570> so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
