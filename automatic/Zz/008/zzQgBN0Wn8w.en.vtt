00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 in them we say brush sneakers they are about 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.989

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.930
 and Dmitry Egorova with you again in touch 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.540
 St. Petersburg Moscow highway house 7b 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.670
 auto lesson air instead of with huge 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.220
 the number of sneakers about which I 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.120
 telling and today our story about 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.489
 running shoes 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.790
 adidas stan smith do not switch your 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.370
 channel and we have already talked about this 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.510
 truly culture model sneaker from 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.450
 adidas originals 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 stand smith classic tennis 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.810
 sneakers 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 where there is nothing superfluous which is very 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.729
 elegant as they were then remain so 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.229
 to this day about the classic white and green 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 modelki it is clear that something 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.820
 tell as it is no longer comme il faut 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 so we will tell about alternative 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.600
 options especially since they are worthy 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.520
 detailed story first sneakers 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.890
 which is called stan smith 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.960
 red your from sneakers that are already on 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.170
 the name can be seen made from such a red 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.660
 brick-colored suede is very very 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.830
 interesting and comfortable sneakers for the summer 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.869
 Suede beautiful soft material red 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.030
 but a color that is not too brand 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.520
 and not too dark plus enough 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 bright if someone likes bright colors on 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.860
 classic sneakers sneakers well yet 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.899
 note that also those who think that three 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.069
 stripes are not always worth 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.530
 adidas models 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.360
 what did the company decide to go 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.209
 towards such a protagonist and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.940
 removed 3 beauty leaving only here 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.819
 such small holes that are 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 and air vents that are very 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.470
 comfortable again for summer sneakers 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.840
 following Stan Smith and fulfilled no longer 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.210
 from suede and from very, very soft 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 black skin principle as i said 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.500
 black color he is never 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.150
 odd in sneakers even in summer when 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.540
 seemingly worth wearing all that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.370
 air checkered and white no black 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.050
 color is also suitable especially if 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.910
 really soft skin 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.390
 if this is classic stan smith and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.610
 which are now combined with such a gold 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.850
 yellow in principle not the most 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.380
 probably the obvious option for cross 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.070
 stand smith nevertheless we are used to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.160
 classics 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.060
 if a brick though they still somehow to 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.709
 fit into this category 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.440
 these are the sneakers 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.700
 A little challenge but there are many who love 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.070
 classic silhouettes 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.810
 but they want to see something new in them 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.700
 new technologies by the way 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.640
 sneakers we will also tell very soon 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.830
 or some unusual colors in the case of 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.290
 toast and me to me this is very very 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.870
 an interesting option that seems to me 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.820
 in color well, like both lovers and 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.010
 classic adidas royal sneakers 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.519
 so and more traditional lovers there 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.440
 nike and other more fashionable things and how 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.450
 always dessert dessert beads 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.750
 and what do we have for dessert not a bit 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.489
 raspberry pudding for dessert with us 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.330
 joint sneakers kolb how else can 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.690
 to name 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.950
 between adidas skateboarding 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.560
 adidas divisions that deal 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.670
 skate shoes and so great 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.400
 companies from los angeles how scandalized 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.959
 we all know that you are depressed controlled 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.970
 two brothers woman 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.400
 and ben and adidas skateboarding decided in 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.160
 your version of sneakers for skateboarding 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.350
 version stan smith almost forgot strange 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.100
 by the way how is it different in the first place 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.140
 vulcanized outsole to compare 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.540
 the sole here is simply stitched here 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.480
 vulcanization method 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.060
 made further sneakers a little bit more 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.130
 are bitten for minutes here for example 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.850
 there is such a thing as springsteen 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.680
 which are technology 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.570
 enhances sneakers for skaters 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.480
 who jump on these sneakers 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.150
 very, very well, it is important to continue to yourself 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.910
 clearance in handred brand of 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.320
 los angeles one of the most interesting 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.050
 probably in my opinion brands from this 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.090
 cities on the west coast which 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.340
 love many skaters who love 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.130
 many guys who just 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.030
 caring for personal style 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.070
 one of the main characters playboy jandro 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.930
 This so -called adam bomb such 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.530
 little bomb here this bomb 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.990
 beautifully inscribed in the adidas plus logo 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.550
 the founders of this brand are two brothers ben &amp; 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.230

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.720
