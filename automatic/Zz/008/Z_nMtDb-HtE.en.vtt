00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.100
 let's turn this shirt on 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:19.800
 advertising in a cool shirt 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:22.230
 fashion let's start doing a little bit 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 just under the armpit to cut 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:34.470
 the whole sleeve we have not 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.670
 left put to know exactly 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.670
 how we want it 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.420
 good 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.390
 when we finish we make a little bit 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.980
 in the right chest to delimit the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.980
 neckline and we cut 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.010
 let's take it and let's put the sleeves 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.010
 very very thin so that it is very sexy 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 the back neckline I 'm going to do it very 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.260
 pointed and square but we can 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.260
 delimit where we want 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.580
 do not forget that it is very important to stretch 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.460
 all the finishes so that the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.260
 curls well well that's how I hope 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 that you liked the back to the master 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.500
 left very accentuated because it is very 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.500
 trend this summer 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.690
 give it a more arranged touch with this 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.820
 mango chain 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.190
 to follow the line of the torn shirt 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.190
 we have caught these fishing cowboys 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.909
 on the feet something as simple as a 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.920
 white debris 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.990
