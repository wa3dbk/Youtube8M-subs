00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.559
 I can stop coming more views are the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.080
 that there are how they are formed can not be believed 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.909
 one increasingly larger if I continue 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.449
 huge happens to me to be protective there 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.100
 Sorry, sorry, but I can not wow 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.670
 Beauty can not be believed more and more 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.190
 big bigger and bigger and bigger 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.309
 they are the huge Dutch Munich really 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.180
 I do not catch and besides 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.470
 19 how waves are formed 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.050
 not the truth that does not touch 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.490
 and you friends know how they are formed 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.170
 the waves very good you asked me the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.860
 health protection 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 the wind pushes them with water and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:25.630
 back because they put wave by the wind 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.300
 with the wind and the sea by the wind that 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.740
 it blows very hard and therefore the salt 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.110
 the best air and water the sea the wind 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.530
 because never ever the trip that water 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.220
 the wind blows and the waves 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.710
 make 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.260
 because he has a wind with talent 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.320
 it blows very hard then it makes it 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.120
 lift the pot 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.120
 things that kids do not tell 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 one 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.070
 a little help me please I ask you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.070
 you saw 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.850
 the singer tries to dry you 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 little bit yes relax that I was 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.000
 fix in the great encyclopedia of the world 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.380
 how the waves are formed 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.380
 it must be the same wave that we work 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 Look topa here says that the waves are 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.210
 many probes that travel above the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.790
 water as I go traveling t inside not 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.980
 above all here gracious these 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 waves are generated by the wind and are what 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.360
 model they shape the coasts a 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.660
 simple wind produces these waves 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.060
 huge not when the wind touches the water 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.170
 the sea is not crumple like a like a 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.020
 accordion clear the wind bends squeezes and 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.600
 pushes the water and thus the wave is formed and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.670
 it forms the wave and so they become so big 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.530
 like the ones that stirred the waves the most 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.470
 they are becoming more and more 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.780
 large the wind lifts them and while 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.060
 they travel by the sea towards the shore they have 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.060
 a force and a speed that makes 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.110
 grow more more and more 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.050
 then the waves are formed by the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.020
 wind not clear and the height of the waves 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.360
 depends on three things the speed of the 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.730
 wind the amount of time that 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.770
 maintains and the time it is blowing 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.790
 in the same direction because if the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.459
 wind 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.290
 the wave becomes more and more and that's how 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.599
 the waves are formed I can not believe it 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.150
 muÃ±oz that the wind helps that 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.219
 form the waves clear and that's why I 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.629
 It seems that this is the best time to 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.120
 so you can get in the water because you see 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.430
 there is nothing of winds in the waves very 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.260
 girls and expect to be right for the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.209
 I 'm an idea that I split if I 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.769
 I go to the sea and you take me pictures because nothing 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.900
 legal so I show it to all my friends 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.609
 very good and two if you do not want to send 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.130
 some question or have any doubt 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.709
 about something or someone or just is 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.520
 thirsty to know more more and more towards 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.440
 the www.disneylatino.com that we 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.750
 let's help discover what is 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.090
 because we are also curious how 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.000
 they will die to prepare the camera because 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.260
 There is dancing to not carry 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.610
 prepared and have everything ready here you 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.180
 I have good there I go withered you 're 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.180
