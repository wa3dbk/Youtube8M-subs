00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:12.599
 it's not a normal game at all so 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.330
 just quiet we know what what 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.130
 we have to do we should play in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.870
 a larger field the last two 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 visiting games we had to play in 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.090
 courts with smaller dimensions and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.269
 good with calm you feel that so 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 done in the match with vélez with racing 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.990
 also few arrivals as favorite 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.330
 this superclassic that has more than 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 river was I think that of these 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.070
 special matches there is no 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.430
 mouth mouth if it comes around the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.950
 last five games 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.100
 I think there are some benefits out there 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.170
 the match with olimpo was not good but 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.330
 the last three if they had been in 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.980
 mouth will go to play the monumental without 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.940
 your fans how do you think this can 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.100
 get to affect the team 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.489
 that the lessons we used everything 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.800
 this tucker championship with few people 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.220
 the last championship I think going in 2000 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.619
 it was very few people so we're already 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.350
 accustomed is not cute is not what 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.740
 more we like we know that this kind of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.479
 matches with your people much more beautiful 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.600
 it ends badly as you have to play a river 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.280
 to beat the game in the monumental 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.289
 causes has to go out to win as 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.259
 says the last three mouth games 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.229
 playing that way trying to win 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.170
 I think I 'm going to have great chances 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.020
 once said roberto cabañas the classic a 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.940
 boca-river can mark the race of a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 footballer in the club on the shirt that 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.440
 is wearing conscious thoughts of 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 what can be from here on more a 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.520
 good performance of yours in a classic what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.770
 that can generate in the mouth fan 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.259
 I am of course I am aware what 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.630
 which is a classic many players 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.149
 they have degree in history out there playing 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 ten matches in the mouth but there 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.320
 having very good superclassic 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 so 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 if it influences a lot but good i am the truth 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.260
 that living quiet and I do not like the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 head thinking about closing or standing not 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.539
 you do poorly and what will happen next I think 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.450
 that the important thing is that mouth towards good 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.600
 comes a good way generating many 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 goal situations then I think what 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.080
 well I can get to have good 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.060
 chances an opportunity for that mouth 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.120
 win that the most important thing 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.310
 how important it is going to be if they get a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.959
 triumph in the monumental facing the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.630
 final straight of the tournament continue with 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.590
 chances I am of course we see ourselves with 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.690
 chance 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.730
 we are aware that we are mouth had 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.040
 that fight up 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.690
 we have been improving a lot finding a 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.069
 regularity and to be able to obtain a victory 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.040
 in a game as special as is the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.140
 classic so it leaves you very well standing 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.939
 emanuel here the other day they played for 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.349
 first time I basically follow with 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.049
 gabo y ry meats together on the court 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.489
 what differences did you notice the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.189
 have them precisely them two and 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.319
 basically two so many games today 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.439
 the team generates much more and the 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.970
 forward knows that out there does not depend 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.790
 just from one player so you can 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.470
 assist all but any of 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.989
 those in the middle can do it 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.760
 then to have many more options 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.760
 that they throw you for the front musicians
