find out later and I'll talk about that

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.780 
find out later and I'll talk about that
if<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.819> do<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.090> review<00:04:04.420> video<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.579> back

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
if I do it review video but in the back

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.289 
if I do it review video but in the back
here<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:08.079> can<00:04:08.200> see<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:08.920> got<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.930> HDMI<00:04:10.930> and

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
here you can see it's got a HDMI and

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.050 
here you can see it's got a HDMI and
HDMI<00:04:13.299> jack<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.650> back<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.549> does<00:04:15.790> have<00:04:16.030> a

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
HDMI jack in the back it does have a

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.110 
HDMI jack in the back it does have a
cat5<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.079> if<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.290> don't<00:04:17.440> have<00:04:17.620> Wi-Fi<00:04:18.160> or<00:04:18.790> if

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
cat5 so if you don't have Wi-Fi or if

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.180 
cat5 so if you don't have Wi-Fi or if
you<00:04:19.239> want<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.540> just<00:04:19.750> have<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.109> wired<00:04:20.380> then<00:04:20.919> you

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
you want to just have it wired then you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.790 
you want to just have it wired then you
can<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:21.579> wire<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:22.090> up<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.360> your<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:23.680> your

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
can just wire it up to your to your

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.159 
can just wire it up to your to your
router<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:25.570> would<00:04:25.750> probably<00:04:25.960> be

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
router and that would probably be

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.680 
router and that would probably be
simpler<00:04:26.620> than<00:04:26.740> jacking<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.490> into<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.000> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
simpler than jacking it into the the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.430 
simpler than jacking it into the the
Wi-Fi<00:04:29.500> on<00:04:29.949> mine<00:04:30.479> I<00:04:31.479> don't<00:04:31.930> particularly<00:04:32.260> care

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
Wi-Fi on mine I don't particularly care

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.890 
Wi-Fi on mine I don't particularly care
for<00:04:32.650> having<00:04:33.340> all<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.910> app<00:04:34.090> stuff<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
for having all the app stuff and the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.990 
for having all the app stuff and the
constant<00:04:35.380> updates<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.639> lot<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.850> the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
constant updates and a lot of the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.700 
constant updates and a lot of the
modern-day<00:04:37.360> blu-rays<00:04:37.960> actually<00:04:39.030> like<00:04:40.030> to

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
modern-day blu-rays actually like to

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.980 
modern-day blu-rays actually like to
download<00:04:41.880> commercials<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.180> stuff<00:04:43.210> in

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
download commercials and stuff in

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.529 
download commercials and stuff in
between<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.860> what<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.340> do<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.150> do<00:04:46.210> all<00:04:46.479> the

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
between so what I do is I do all the

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.600 
between so what I do is I do all the
firmware<00:04:46.840> updates<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.650> cat5<00:04:48.099> and<00:04:48.130> then<00:04:48.580> I

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
firmware updates on the cat5 and then I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.879 
firmware updates on the cat5 and then I
unplug<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:50.050> speeds<00:04:50.410> up<00:04:50.560> along<00:04:50.860> my

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
unplug it and that speeds up along my

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.010 
unplug it and that speeds up along my
blu-rays<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.760> haven't<00:04:52.120> had<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.270> problem<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:52.750> far

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
blu-rays I haven't had a problem so far

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.080 
blu-rays I haven't had a problem so far
but<00:04:53.289> I<00:04:53.349> do<00:04:53.470> kind<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:53.979> expect<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:55.030> the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
but I do kind of expect that in the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.770
