00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello everyone I'm king welcome to a 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.980
 New episode of New York Pokemon 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.740
 in the episode today and they speak to me 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.740
 whatsapp we have to explain how 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.640
 not explain anything let's go by law 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.270
 I'll explain that to megas 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.690
 civil and speak to you and whatever you want to call it 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.470
 let's meditate 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:36.100
 three things that are wikileaks 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:41.150
 this is today ix i came back 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 and the same is true because because apart from 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.059
 that are super effective 23 because it is 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.840
 sinister type is mega seibel there we go 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.540
 here and let's see the the skill that 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 they have 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.350
 I went back 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 let's go faster if I do this 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.199
 try 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.199
 and that this 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.909
 I want to see this little but if I have done it 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.909
 before 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 they are surrounding is the same let's see it 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.659
 well in fact we can see it from the same 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.270
 let's go for mega simple and the rest 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.270
 how you explain better what d 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.710
 you can not challenge a civil line up 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 that there is captured 15 pokÃ©mons 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.560
 captured 29 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.689
 so yes I can what fright hit me 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.330
 God explained the clock is worth as you see 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.720
 to face to face also 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.890
 615 pokemon you had 29 and I could be worth 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 if you look 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.870
 they recommend these three that I said 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.100
 and we're going to take the doctor in gascan and 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.390
 I will explain why our food in 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.320
 these three apart from that they are super 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.320
 Effective loomis ability 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.950
 he returned it 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.660
 if I gave it back what it does is that when 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.680
 I have returned more from candelaria makes more 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.680
 damage is worth 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.680
 what it does and loomis is that if in two 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:33.710
 We can change the interference meter 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.870
 that interference by a thread 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.150
 saves is the same I'm explaining how 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.530
 the ass fucking but it's better to move to the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.300
 practice that we have to carry these 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.730
 three because these four good pokemons 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.740
 I do not know if it's better on the mega scale 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:54.750
 I gaudino but those three safe pokemon 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.750
 20 movements 1 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.870
 to interference 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.170
 OK 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.170
 let's take out crumbs would be fine 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.230
 let's put this here 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.239
 remember that a Mexican is needed 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.830
 that we capture it for what I owe with 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.650
 three turns to attack her is like that 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.450
 but for example here and I came back 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.450
 pretty hurt 220 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.709
 and a mix as I came back 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.709
 a shield would be correct 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.470
 and that it falls and 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.570
 For this 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.920
 defrost another just checks us 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.040
 let's put 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
 we have to remove that triple that of 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.040
 here in the middle and have is change of 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.660
 above that you feel that the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.830
 pokemons also do this for this 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.380
 OK 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.380
 we're doing fine I do not know 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.880
 Let's see 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.200
 what could 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.570
 change no no 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.360
 how to do this in truth and let the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.840
 from above the drums and you're 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.840
 the fucking shit 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.689
 let's remove this separation 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.689
 plus 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.310
 but it has been a good move 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.379
 God 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.790
 spending time 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.570
 in this code 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.800
 I'm very fucked 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.090
 and this is going to get the mega damaged 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.090
 against before 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.910
 but not listening 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.330
 here good doing is very good friends 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.330
 but 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.110
 good and I want it with gels here it's worth 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.900
 we went to see if we took once 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.669
 at least 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.900
 the good ones have to be removed 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.419
 stockings as soon as possible 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.860
 it is 10 entered the other pokemones 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.270
 that were super effective but good that 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.199
 you have a letter the last one we have 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.700
 taken one s we have the mega of these 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.060
 five more hearts 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.639
 to continue 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.449
 so let's continue a bit to 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.449
 watch 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.449
 evelyne 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.220
 like now we get a slow box is kind 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.680
 psychic 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.680
 we are sinister we will be effective 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.490
 and see what we can do 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.840
 here limbo clean I want to take out the mega 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.470
 we're really going to leave the mega 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.470
 quickly 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.350
 h 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.350
 here 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.060
 the sooner 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.050
 here 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.960
 this 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:47.760
 slow slow bots 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.760
 thing that I'm going for this 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.669
 In addition you can see the line to make it cost 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.669
 much 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.100
 and let's see what a circle like that is 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.880
 illuminates everything in the circle to 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.880
 do how is it being based 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:12.309
 okay with this it tells me it's broken me 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.289
 love I like is powerful of the bad 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:16.869
 is will remove quite serious in taking out the 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.279
 mega but good let's see if with a 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:22.349
 bit of luck we capture this 

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:22.349
 lookbook I think we get the s 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.290
 come today is seriously with 80% in order 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.820
 then this fuck me is what there is 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.060
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:38.300
 this video of megatv light 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:42.139
 remember you have to get these three 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.700
 pokemons before for example the uni if your 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.000
 block are pretty easy but I went back 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:49.940
 they have very little capture percentage 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.590
 as maximums you will reach 20 or so yes that 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.150
 you have to repeat it several times and I 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.800
 I have distributed it I have repeated it four 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.230
 times but until I captured it and what 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.990
 same the ix to the first the two but 

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.300
 but if you really want to have a good time 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.490
 sure you have to get all three 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.650
 these so I do not expect anything that I have 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:10.720
 liked and that has been useful and see you 

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.720
 in the next video goodbye
