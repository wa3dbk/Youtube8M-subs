00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.499 
change of a system is going to hurt
change<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> hurt<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> players

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509

change it's going to hurt the players
this<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.799> assuming<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.280> GM<00:01:56.640> wants

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
this I think I'm assuming this GM wants

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.940 
this I think I'm assuming this GM wants
to<00:01:57.090> blow<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.899> Raiders<00:01:58.320> team<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> start

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to blow up this Raiders team and start

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.950 
to blow up this Raiders team and start
from<00:01:59.159> scratch<00:01:59.219> again<00:01:59.549> that's<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.869> I'm

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
from scratch again that's just what I'm

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
from scratch again that's just what I'm
logically<00:02:01.590> thinking<00:02:02.090> there's<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> saint<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
logically thinking there's the saint of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
logically thinking there's the saint of
