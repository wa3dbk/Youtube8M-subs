00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.240
 now we go to the chihuahua and we have a 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.219
 career of being 3 in the country of finland 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.889
 and we are using the toyota celica of 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.119
 the nineties precious car that I 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.289
 I loved when I was at school and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.589
 here we go 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.759
 wow let's play live you know what 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.339
 that it costs me to play live and 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.480
 handle the same time truth 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.789
 and all the changes to my videos of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.059
 tertsch rallies know that game of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.059
 erc on difficulty 5 I think it was nothing 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.220
 I do not even remember and almost never 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.030
 I use flash backs I do not like me 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.030
 they seem to cheat 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 let's pay attention to the tacos chapel 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.980
 you know that if you pay attention to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.739
 co-pilot practically does not have neither 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.010
 see the minimap is so good what it says 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 it is also done as we are going to part 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.330
 that gives you advice like for example 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.750
 right now that 's thomas bach I'm going to the 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.330
 recover 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.110
 we go to tips like that you stay 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.240
 inside the curve or outside or with the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 right 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 to obtain 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.119
 I think there's a tight curve to the 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.520
 left but brother 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.289
 it's too bad 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.549
 come on let's go let the ica go let's go 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.549
 all the Japanese power 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.130
 love 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.470
 ok here comes a tight curve the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.710
 right 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.370
 well it's still wrong now yes 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.370
 we go 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.600
 come on let's go we go over the bridge 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.040
 and we come to the end let's see how 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.710
 what's up, how about I'm in third 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.940
 place that jett or mike catt that more 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.110
 I did see but it was not therefore 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.760
 they won for a second this I can 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.080
 recover in what follows I can 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.590
 recover the power that recover like this 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.600
 equal concentrate all laura time is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.210
 a little slow so let's jump 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.890
 forward now we have ok you 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.790
 they just saw a second ago that the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 power of the edition I'm going in third place 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.420
 third programs a second and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.450
 half below the first one so to 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.250
 pay attention to pay attention to 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.670
 this race to perfection and regained 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 that little bit 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.840
 opposites do not give or forgive 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.840
 nothing 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.830
 go Go 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.830
 let's that pine crash 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.950
 that you can go back 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.500
 there it goes 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.500
 Now let electric 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.570
 because very well very well 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.290
 go Go 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.769
 ok I keep to the right we go that 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.769
 this you can 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.620
 today it comes well in a closed closed and 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.620
 a closed 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.110
 loves drift too much 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.920
 let's do it very well 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 go Go 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.950
 either the bridge or the little bridge 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.950
 of before 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.510
 go Go 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.510
 nothing else we go that recovered we go what is 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.690
 this topic are delaying me 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.670
 there is the end we go as it says as 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.830
 it says first place ok but it depends on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.410
 time depends on whether you win or not 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.990
 to see an advantage, yes, I won by 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.860
 more than two seconds and I am the winner we 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.530
 may but beware of what you win or is it 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.090
 by micro-milliseconds against the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.530
 Australian 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.790
