00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.090 

check<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.420> edges<00:01:43.810> again<00:01:46.619> once<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.770> edges

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
check the edges again once the edges

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.520

start<00:01:48.399> releasing<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.630> get<00:01:49.780> ready<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.079> flip<00:01:50.380> it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
start releasing and get ready to flip it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:03.590

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.270 

the<00:02:07.780> second<00:02:08.200> side<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.590> won't<00:02:08.740> want<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.070> cook

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the second side you won't want to cook

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.490 
the second side you won't want to cook
as<00:02:09.429> long<00:02:09.460> maybe<00:02:10.000> about<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.330> minute<00:02:10.539> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
as long maybe about a minute and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.440 
as long maybe about a minute and
remember<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.190> continue<00:02:12.400> adjusting<00:02:13.120> your<00:02:13.210> heat

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
remember to continue adjusting your heat

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.010

so<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.780> doesn't<00:02:13.810> burn<00:02:18.510> again<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.810> check

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so it doesn't burn again you can check

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.630 
so it doesn't burn again you can check
the<00:02:20.200> edges<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:20.980> they<00:02:21.100> release<00:02:21.430> from

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the edges to see if they release from

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.000 
the edges to see if they release from
the<00:02:21.760> pan<00:02:22.320> needs<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.470> little<00:02:23.709> bit<00:02:23.830> more<00:02:23.980> time

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the pan needs a little bit more time

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.199 
the pan needs a little bit more time
okay<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.160> been<00:02:27.280> about<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.520> minute<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.000> this

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
okay it's been about a minute on this

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.400 
okay it's been about a minute on this
side<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:30.459> loosen<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.940> edges

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.080 

and<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.040> you'll<00:02:37.190> want<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.460> transfer<00:02:37.940> the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
and then you'll want to transfer the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.960 
and then you'll want to transfer the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
can cut it into bite sized pieces when

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.900 
can cut it into bite sized pieces when
you<00:03:00.260> transfer<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:00.830> color<00:03:01.100> tea<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> serving

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
you transfer the color tea to a serving

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.820 
you transfer the color tea to a serving
platter<00:03:08.110> where<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.200> can<00:03:09.350> sprinkle<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.800> with

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
platter where you can sprinkle it with

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.440
