00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.150
 show you how I block my knitted 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.799
 But on such things 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.529
 puzzle mats for children they are sold in 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.720
 children's stores, they certainly are not cheap 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.369
 but this purchase that will serve you 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.359
 very long if you are a lover of knitting shawls 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:31.809
 tablecloths and just perform well 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.989
 blocking then they surely will 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:38.469
 indispensable in your household 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.780
 I strongly advise here I have found a mistake 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.600
 see that one clove 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.460
 irregularly blocked ie there 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.219
 all exactly the same distance from 1 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 I somehow had to fall out badly 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.410
 irons a little tweak generally very 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.920
 happy as with a shawl blocked 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.170
 for some reason it was very difficult for me to lay out 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.770
 I do n't know exactly the circle 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.890
 tormented 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.350
 if anyone has any secrets 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.180
 tell me please share me 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.070
 really hours 2 probably crawled so that 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.369
 I had a beautiful smooth circle with 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.700
 equal diameter at every point in 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.550
 In general, all I will shoot a little bit 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.979
 I will do it and every girl here withdrew us 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.720
 without lock like this it looks like 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.170
 dark floor so you can have a better 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.369
 I see the picture very much to me 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.649
 like the openwork so nice in general i 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.540
 in general, quite like the method of ma 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:40.000
 This here on kediki which 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.050
 in large quantities in this model 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.470
 presented they generally make her 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.330
 tablecloth 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.710
 only al who that will knit very 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.820
 airy and so spectacular she of course 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.570
 I have a very strong crash prayed 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.160
 morning you see the sun 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.080
 how tough is she ? 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.080
 I am currently a little tan utjuzhkom 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.459
 this is a tablecloth conflict 1 made of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.459
 cotton 2 tablecloth this jacquard fabric 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:41.519
 the tablecloth is knitted very easily begins 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:45.170
 it is from the center from here and in a circle already 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:51.390
 dock we knit rim knits 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 perpendicular to the tablecloth channel obliges 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.510
 so here and here in this place 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.769
 last loop to and we are with 100 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.019
 criminal to free open loops 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.049
 tablecloths modelka very easy not 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.170
 be careful not to tie such large round 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.909
 things though actually the tablecloth is much 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.129
 the more I connected only the central 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.069
 part I can not imagine how much 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.769
 place to block 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.980
 full version of balls or tablecloths 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.810
 these are just things I donâ€™t represent 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.810
 a lot of territory
