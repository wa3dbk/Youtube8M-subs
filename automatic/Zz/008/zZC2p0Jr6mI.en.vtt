00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.849
 hello everyone guys are well 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.110
 staff of fetal ultimatives we are here with 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.169
 a leader score 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.140
 back with a scud builder too 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:24.380
 we like this very bagato as you know 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.330
 It is a little bug with a team built 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.310
 a 4 3 1 2 that one of the modules that 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.590
 I prefer more honestly than this 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.809
 I can't play a lot on the game 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.150
 side bands accordingly this 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.540
 form that by three midfielders who 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.420
 give both a good cover and a god 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.199
 good entries here then we begin 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.150
 from the doorman 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.229
 I think he is one of the best goalkeepers 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.460
 of the game 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.280
 the Italian of paris saint germain 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.369
 salvatore sirigu there are 112 games 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.180
 a fantastic player one of the best 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.500
 goalkeepers right back of the rome 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.570
 Brazilian and is not the only Brazilian 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.780
 of Rome 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.369
 maicon we open a chapter last year 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.119
 he was stronger 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.189
 this year he lost a little bit like 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.899
 on the other hand also in the truth though 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.159
 I think he continues to be one of the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.140
 best full-backs of the game 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.049
 especially the fact that balanced a 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.600
 in all it also makes good passages 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.340
 to a great physique a good dribbling for 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.439
 be a fullback 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.009
 we say that in my opinion it is still one of the 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.719
 best game fullbacks we go with 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.320
 the central defender obviously triple 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.520
 agreement with leandro castan that own 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.859
 in the moment in which there will be 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 this video has announced to be 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.729
 returned to training as we know 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.409
 this year he did not play for gods 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.770
 quite serious health problems 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.960
 in fifa 15 got a big upgrade 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 more than deserved and as a player it is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.210
 excellent warcraft perfect normal high 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.340
 so great player really too 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.509
 if the player stronger than the defense 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.380
 of this team absolutely him 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:06.469
 neither tiago nor Brazilian silva he too 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 paris saint germain with still 78 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.030
 physical defense speed 80 80 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.920
 strongest defender in the world as well as 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.319
 in my opinion stronger defender of the game 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.900
 along with really strong boateng 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.970
 I got him at 45,000 credits more than one 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 month ago, however, consider that you can 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.960
 to take 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.210
 27 25 if I am not mistaken the minimum price is 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.650
 that we close the defensive department 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.690
 with another player paris saint 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.780
 germain that is lucas of it you can also 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.060
 put maxwell but I like it better 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.209
 of good physical good speed 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.010
 despite the statistics on the card 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.959
 looks like a cassette 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.330
 he also gave me an assist does his 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.560
 I work decently 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.209
 let's go to the first midfield 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.650
 midfielder who does indeed understand with 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.840
 chestnuts and maicon 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.110
 raja naingolan you can also use 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.450
 its version or not up 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.820
 or its pressure in the form very 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.739
 strong but it is also quite strong this 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.959
 raja version I really have to say 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.200
 complete as a player he also makes 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.670
 great shots a great physical other 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.380
 top of works then you find it at 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 run around the field to the right and to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.150
 left to lend a hand forward backwards 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.130
 really very good fortissimo a 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.890
 player that I absolutely love you 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.470
 advice next to him 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:26.830
 we begin to hybridize here it would be 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:29.560
 come on and of and that is not a wish that you 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.170
 I do in English but it is a 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.120
 midfielder of the Basel basilica 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.000
 now I play the stuttgart 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.540
 but you have to take that of Basel 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.170
 which is very complete at a normal high of 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.810
 warcraft 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.070
 as you can see therefore it is a true cdc e 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.799
 just the same must be in front 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.739
 to the defense but 81 of speed which is one 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.120
 crazy thing is really fast you do 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.579
 recoveries in the attackers of it 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.010
 midfielders who join the 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.250
 recovery is really really lightning fast 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.820
 and then 85 really physical a rock 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.620
 great player who makes agreement with 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:11.799
 yapi yapo the name always makes me laugh 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.410
 Ivorian midfielder of the zurich 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.090
 gilles yapi yapo normal normal of 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.310
 busquets let's say that frey between is that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.200
 a little bit more, however, less like 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
 speed does not reflect what is there 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.700
 on paper it looks slightly more 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.050
 fast three-star demonstrability three 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.030
 weak foot stars a good player 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.960
 normal that serves more than anything else for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.689
 intended to do what the Ivorian also there 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.249
 he plays in Basel 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:40.019
 giovannino ceo we know it because 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:42.059
 rocco has already brought a drain builder 

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:44.339
 with him however with his version of the 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.989
 bastian you always have to take that 

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:47.279
 of the basel 

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:48.899
 actually he is an attacker then 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.729
 you have to consider that you have to find 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:53.549
 search for or his card as cirques or 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.379
 you have to take it like we do 

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:59.519
 kill 91 speed attacker e 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.439
 a striker very fast 

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:03.689
 added consider why not go 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.929
 great passages as I prefer 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.599
 instead that they do the coc however in 

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:12.209
 this case must necessarily be there 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.959
 by force of understanding it is a glue between 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:16.439
 these two attackers on the right seydou 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.729
 doumbia 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:22.529
 the bug of the 4- star Rome bugs foot 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.179
 weak 4- star chance the player 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.569
 we already know all the people of Trapani there 

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:30.209
 he made bruno sculpted der with him with the 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.589
 its version escapes us that for me at least 

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:35.549
 to me it seemed much more paid than this 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:38.039
 strange media I only made one goal in 

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:39.659
 I don't know five games of soul 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.379
 with that I did at least two or three goals a 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.149
 game 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.529
 however, I think I should play 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.360
 even more to see the player 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.759
 as really but we all know it 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.489
 doumbia and we close with the tip of 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.239
 diamond that classic cawi inform 5 

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:56.639
 stars weak foot 5 star chance 

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:59.269
 the zlatan ibrahimovic of the poor 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.429
 three goals three games five goals an assist 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:04.379
 There is also devastating to review the 

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:07.169
 I'll put it here in the tabs above a 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:11.639
 absolutely right player 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:15.360
 fantastic finalist only assists 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.429
 tall man takes her head 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.259
 do the crazy dribbles of course 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:20.879
 with the five-star possibilities a 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.959
 player that I loved very much 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:27.779
 so this team is the cost here 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.999
 I have to say if he's not wrong about 150 160 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:33.559
 thousand credits even less especially 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:37.800
 we cawi now see at what price here 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:43.829
 has disconnected me from the latest team files 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:46.499
 crazy anyway we cawi here cawi us 

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:47.070
 it should be found at maximum 12,000 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:50.550
 maximum 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.140
 2000 so it is presented at that price 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.680
 all the others are more or less at price 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:59.490
 we also see ceo as waste 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.310
 di and also yapi yapo okay okay 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.500
 instructions as I always say you 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.290
 advice as always to tell the two 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.260
 fullbacks to stay in records back in 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.240
 attack because they give you more coverage e 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.450
 the two attackers to attack the 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.770
 depth then to go here 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.080
 offensive entries enter ti alle 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.850
 shoulders for both strikers in 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.290
 which and I hope this builder is there 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.480
 liked if you tried the team 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.990
 let me know leave a like if there is 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.990
 liked
