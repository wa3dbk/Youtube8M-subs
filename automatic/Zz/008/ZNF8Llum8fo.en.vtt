00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.319
 Stephane you just reported on 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.840
 win the grand prize of paris 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.309
 you who you say often invoked a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.710
 good handicap jockey it's a beautiful 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.849
 handicap that wanted to win 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 yeah I have no disabilities because 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.890
 it's racing cds that I like 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
 go up because we all have the same 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.840
 luck with disabilities 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 so me and me it's a challenge that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.260
 I settle down but at the same time 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.149
 quintés the zouker club is a quinté 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.440
 this year it's good too 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.140
 races that are quintés so me that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.090
 do not bother me if I can win a bow 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.950
 even if it's a quinté it's good to see 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 come more seriously to the grand prize of 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 Paris remained undefeated 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.860
 they remain unbeaten and in addition there is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.989
 win with a jacket that keeps you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 heart 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.610
 yes unbeaten yes I admit he went up 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 a real plateau when he won the prize 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 lily whipped cream because we came from 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.930
 win a 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.270
 a list helps for his second race 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.650
 he's just going up the ladder 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.299
 supplemented in the paris grand prix 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.369
 it's not nothing, it's because we think 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.549
 that it's a horse that has shifted from 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.920
 quality pardon he proved it today 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.049
 the casa that makes me happy because I 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 works for for the archos family and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.070
 I give all my heart like every 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.820
 times for all my contracts even though 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 it's not the crowds 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 today at longchamp you celebrated 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 that like a victory in football and in 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.890
 more than that we saw that at the round of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.290
 presentation you have a real fan club 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.299
 really help aficionados yeah bah 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.130
 it's just because I was born 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 the other side of the Seine so I know 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.430
 exactly it's people that I that I 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.470
 have known since I was hungry 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 since I was very young that you 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590
 embarrassment earlier because we're all going 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.360
 take it back 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.340
 since very young and there are some 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.540
 with whom I went to other schools 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.890
 that I still meet my coffee when 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.090
 I'm going to see my parents so it's 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.740
 important to see these people there I 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.079
 adapts to everyone at no 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.000
 problem but that kind of reaction with 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.259
 you who extended both arms to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.880
 the whole presentation tour 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.530
 it's still quite rare and it's a 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.210
 moment that really had to get you 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.290
 a great joy quite rare in not one 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.850
 should do it because it's 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.610
 people who came they came 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.410
 to support it's still very 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.660
 really nice for them to be able to 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.780
 to touch 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.220
 closely the main actors me 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.420
 I admit that if I could just tend 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.490
 the hand to the tan I will be the most 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.250
 happy of the world so it is they are they 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.920
 are not they are not easy to approach 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 we can afford to do it on 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.700
 ad on are we are idols for 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.040

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.510
 to share those moments with the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.510
 public and the entourage
