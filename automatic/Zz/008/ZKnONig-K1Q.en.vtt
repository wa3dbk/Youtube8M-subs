00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.180 

I<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.380> what<00:02:18.680> you've<00:02:18.830> got<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.100> look

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
I think this is what you've got to look

I think this is what you've got to look
at<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.990> what<00:02:21.170> started<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.800> little

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
at you now this is what started a little

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.730 
at you now this is what started a little
bit<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.580> rocky<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.050> man<00:02:24.230> gets<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.620> off

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
bit of the rocky as the man gets up off

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.650 
bit of the rocky as the man gets up off
the<00:02:24.800> floor<00:02:25.040> watch<00:02:25.760> him<00:02:26.000> he<00:02:26.090> kicks<00:02:26.330> him<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the floor watch him he kicks him in the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
the floor watch him he kicks him in the
face<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.260> believe<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.980> kurt<00:02:28.190> sorensen

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
face I do believe that kurt sorensen

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.730 
face I do believe that kurt sorensen
made<00:02:28.910> more<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.450> than<00:02:29.720> what<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:30.320> I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
made more of that than what it was I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.070 
made more of that than what it was I
don't<00:02:31.100> think<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.400> was<00:02:31.610> necessary<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.840> kick

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
don't think that was necessary the kick

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.530 
don't think that was necessary the kick
was<00:02:33.290> not<00:02:33.470> important<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.120> Kurt<00:02:35.120> did<00:02:35.300> make<00:02:35.510> a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
was not important but Kurt did make a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:49.980 
was not important but Kurt did make a
lot<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:37.420> witness<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:39.740> possession

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.670 

and<00:02:50.500> when<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.660> think<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.840> are<00:02:53.080> still<00:02:53.290> stars

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and when you think that are still stars

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.670 
and when you think that are still stars
like<00:02:54.240> when<00:02:55.240> tribune<00:02:55.630> is<00:02:55.750> sent<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.020> john<00:02:56.350> Devon

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
like when tribune is sent to john Devon

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.140 
like when tribune is sent to john Devon
