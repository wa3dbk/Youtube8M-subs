faces as it gets steeper speed works
against<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> helps<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.340> start<00:00:23.609> very

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
rough all the way up so it was also good

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
issue on Rock the bike gets good grit so

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.910 
issue on Rock the bike gets good grit so

every blip of the throttle tends to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.550 
every blip of the throttle tends to
launch<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.490> bike<00:01:36.700> forward<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.869> two<00:01:38.200> strokes

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
launch the bike forward and two strokes

have<00:01:38.799> such<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.159> crisp<00:01:39.729> throttle<00:01:40.330> response<00:01:40.720> they

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
have such a crisp throttle response they

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.030 
have such a crisp throttle response they
need<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:41.920> gentle<00:01:42.520> right<00:01:42.759> hand<00:01:43.440> we<00:01:44.440> spend<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.860> fair

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
need a gentle right hand we spend a fair

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.609 
need a gentle right hand we spend a fair
bit<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.280> time<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:45.790> second<00:01:46.299> gear<00:01:46.540> on<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.229> climb

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
bit of time in second gear on this climb

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.490 
bit of time in second gear on this climb
then<00:01:48.340> slipping<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.060> clutch<00:01:49.299> we<00:01:49.600> need<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.140> it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
then slipping the clutch we need it it

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.320 
then slipping the clutch we need it it
was<00:01:50.710> much<00:01:50.920> easier<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.430> control<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.090> bikes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
was much easier to control the bikes

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:04.990 
was much easier to control the bikes
then

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.350 

halfway<00:02:05.690> out<00:02:06.020> were<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.740> step<00:02:07.220> ups<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:08.149> row

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
halfway out were to step ups in a row

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.719 
halfway out were to step ups in a row
the<00:02:08.930> approach<00:02:09.259> was<00:02:09.530> gnarly<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.460> was<00:02:10.580> great

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
the approach was gnarly so it was great

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.150 
the approach was gnarly so it was great

another<00:03:26.319> thing<00:03:26.590> bird<00:03:26.860> she'd<00:03:27.190> mentioned<00:03:27.580> was

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
another thing bird she'd mentioned was

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.479 
another thing bird she'd mentioned was
using<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.840> terrain<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.560> pull<00:03:29.860> advantage

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
using the terrain to pull advantage

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.729 
using the terrain to pull advantage
there<00:03:31.060> were<00:03:31.120> two<00:03:31.330> particular<00:03:31.720> spots<00:03:32.319> where<00:03:32.620> we

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
there were two particular spots where we

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.270 
there were two particular spots where we
used<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.220> terrain<00:03:33.640> as<00:03:33.970> kickers<00:03:34.510> here<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:36.040> jump

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
used the terrain as kickers here to jump

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.020 
used the terrain as kickers here to jump
over<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> hole<00:03:36.879> on<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> rock<00:03:37.360> base

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.570 

and<00:03:40.150> then<00:03:40.750> here<00:03:41.080> there<00:03:41.710> was<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.830> little<00:03:42.010> knob<00:03:42.340> we

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
and then here there was a little knob we
