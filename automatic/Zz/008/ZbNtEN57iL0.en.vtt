00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.269
 hi all guys save your glasses 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.230
 today's video I'm like you know 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.020
 whether the name is devoted to the dose and probably 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 many faced the problem that 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.920
 threatened someone there yes yes type I myself 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.099
 you rain here let us your address 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.930
 I advise you to immediately save for 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.760
 this person fire extinguisher when you him 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.880
 break off what you up to possess 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.140
 sufficient skills 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.320
 dose protection that I give you now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 tell and, in general, well tell yourself 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.129
 what doses are and how does it work at all 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.039
 I am very amused by people who are nothing about 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.360
 It does not know what type of open mouth come 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.059
 Iâ€™ll write my address there and let you know 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.550
 doses named date will weakly say 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.210
 so here it is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.719
 but probably did not come up with the first person 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.360
 who carried out the doses it was someone from 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.680
 newspapers but I don't know, maybe absolute 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.369
 accident here in general happened like this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 that very many are threatened with this and what 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.770
 same de dust doses is an attack 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.680
 aimed at one or more 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.290
 computers 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.070
 want doses at all in their own way 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.650
 abbreviation 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.740
 but it's like these four letters, well, those who 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.490
 does not know 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.890
 adidas is the kind of thing that leads to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.440
 failure or temporarily not working capacity 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.260
 computer i mean 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.200
 for example you spammed his Internet channel 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.710
 or did not leave space on 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 drive 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 which subsequently began to clear 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 then the budget is well shorter that way 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 boy broke computer and just kidding 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.080
 broke down 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 in general what happens during the doza in 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.320
 time yes yes with you send to your 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.080
 the Internet 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.640
 channel or on the computer itself but there already 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.520
 how do you want the attack itself ru 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:18.569
 So in general, if a person does not have 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.000
 your ip address is not your system 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.590
 files or rather there is no access to your 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.110
 system files in real 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.390
 time that is right now he can't 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.209
 go on you comp on your computer or have 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.640
 he does not have 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.650
 This computer is more powerful than you and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.370
 many factors that I can 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.140
 list 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.340
 Well, at least this is one of the main 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.860
 which I know here that these provocations 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.580
 can not even give in because 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.790
 they put it mildly useless all about 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.630
 sandoz 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.209
 Well, that is, carried out the attack and attack 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.000
 can pass or fail pass it 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.360
 if a person does not have protection 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.459
 on the computer itself i have it 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.130
 open ports and well, there will give in general everything 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.160
 what i have listed before but here then 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.880
 chances are doses of it if a person 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.320
 good about it on familiar with him and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.190
 appropriate programs for 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.440
 the implementation of this before the doses and here and after 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.500
 this all 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.660
 when you still wondered you can 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.400
 shield from him but if the spout is not 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.090
 master you can calm it into darkness 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.250
 loft prepared okay stew 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.269
 so what to do to still 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.980
 rumored hackers you are not in favor of force 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.890
 1 I advise you to close the ports I do not know 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.630
 why do you have to do it but how does it check 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.769
 practice it helps 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.660
 I didn't really go into that 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.060
 why does it open to close ports for what 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.150
 it is necessary but mostly when 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.500
 inform the project any opens 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.420
 pore 25 565 for users including 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.110
 for hackers 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.380
 and it turns out that I recognized your ip 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.430
 address and picked up the appropriate 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.680
 corresponding package we will talk 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.460
 so your weak point goes to 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.860
 Internet packages as well 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.780
 packet whether the processor is clogged or 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.300
 internet traffic if you have fast 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.560
 Internet all you have nothing to fear for 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.470
 there is only one way through 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.570
 processor which will die out 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.140
 but here again there are several ways 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.300
 either sending requests the answer to which 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:48.060
 will be in the section in the top ten breaks 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.830
 more or same quantity but again 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.820
 read on wikipedia they are 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.120
 collect will tell this and therefore want 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.190
 you immediately give advice if you are promised 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.710
 udacity well, in general, well, you yourself understand 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.690
 do not tell you I advise you 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.100
 just don't give in to provocations 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.220
 quiet game and if you flew 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.960
 internet during some kind of battle this 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.210
 absolutely can be an accident either 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.200
 bad connection with your computer and 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.210
 how to build a good internet 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.060
 computer connection if you have everything 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.350
 quickly 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.170
 high speed internet I will tell 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.600
 maybe in the next video well 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.820
 you had a glass if you probably 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.840
 this video helped then i'm very happy well from 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.840
 thank you all bye bye
