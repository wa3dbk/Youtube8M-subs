00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.150
 it was very well the truth very comfortable as 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.460
 one more of the team 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.720
 and very happy to be here and live 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.550
 this experience and 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.550
 I am happy in mother 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.890
 best 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 men you take the most with are 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 with those who live the longest 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.100
 all the guards of the hours that is 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.920
 fixed with them my guard for example 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.469
 with what I am more now is with xavi 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.089
 convulsa but I get along well with everyone and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.950
 it's a team and at the end with all 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.500
 they spoke you know them previously 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.170
 and very good with everyone 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 for true this for me is like my house 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.640
 since I am very happy I am very well 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.550
 as long as there are not open these releases 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.580
 do not 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:54.180
 6 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.180
 straight to say my facebook 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.180
 by severe from the mood 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.860
 I like it 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.299
 or 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.820
 Well, today we had a night 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.820
 pretty complicated 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.450
 we have had quite some wind 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.370
 big clouds 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.630
 the comparison has not gone too well 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.490
 from america and where 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.730
 they have managed to make a more direction 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.110
 to the south direct without jibes and in addition 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.290
 we had to maneuver to change 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.540
 candle and so on so we 've lost a few 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.050
 miles but now we arrive a very area 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.730
 complicated is carrying the wind 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.220
 a lot we had to fight after 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.660
 a couple of times and you can pass any 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.090
 thing 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.910
 those in front are a bit far away but the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.980
 truth is important what is important 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.040
 is to reach the south and take the first 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.630
 coming depression are like trains is 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.520
 important that we take the same train that 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.560
 them even a little further back if 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.280
 We took the same train 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.989
 we are on that train then it has already happened 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.750
 the miles down there when the ship goes 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.849
 very fast because those small arms in 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.580
 any problem then be able to change 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.560
 all 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.660
 we have to focus on that getting 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.030
 pass this transition and even if 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.700
 behind the head boats get 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.160
 take the same train and in it we are 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.930
 Now, check the mast before 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.220
 of entering a hard wind area 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.030
 to see that there is no small 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.920
 problem that is still 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.430
 the same on the boat you have to check it 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.920
 everyone who is all well and fight 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 to enter inside a little bit already in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.900
 the first storm of the South Atlantic
