one gigabyte of RAM and a gigabytes of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the first step is basically that you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
the first step is basically that you

need that USB hub and the USB flash

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
drive and then his custom 64 bit version
of<00:01:32.850> boom<00:01:33.090> 2<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> need<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> go

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
of boom 2 and then you need to go

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.630 
of boom 2 and then you need to go
through<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.710> bunch<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.979> steps<00:01:35.159> again<00:01:35.460> I'm<00:01:35.549> not

can<00:01:38.460> find<00:01:38.640> them<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.150> cuting<00:01:39.420> comm<00:01:39.860> once

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
can find them at little cuting comm once

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
can find them at little cuting comm once
you've<00:01:41.009> done<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.270> everything<00:01:42.270> sort<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you've done that everything sort of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
you've done that everything sort of
works<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.500> audio<00:01:43.890> playback<00:01:44.310> is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
works but audio playback is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
works but audio playback is
extraordinarily<00:01:45.060> choppy<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.280> next<00:01:47.490> way

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
extraordinarily choppy so the next way

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
extraordinarily choppy so the next way
around<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> enter<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> couple<00:01:49.229> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
around that is to enter a couple of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.120 
around that is to enter a couple of
different<00:01:49.560> commands<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:51.229> then<00:01:52.229> go

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
different commands and you can then go

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.690 
different commands and you can then go
in<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.020> change<00:01:55.020> from<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.560> 64-bit<00:01:56.189> bootloader

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
in and change from a 64-bit bootloader

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.459 
in and change from a 64-bit bootloader
even<00:01:57.149> though<00:01:57.210> we're<00:01:57.329> using<00:01:57.479> 64-bit<00:01:57.990> software

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
even though we're using 64-bit software

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.330 
even though we're using 64-bit software
to<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> 32-bit<00:01:59.460> bootloader<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:01.290> makes<00:02:02.250> our

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
to a 32-bit bootloader that makes our

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.310 
to a 32-bit bootloader that makes our
audio<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.759> work<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:03.960> there's<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
audio not work at all then there's a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
audio not work at all then there's a
patch<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> apply<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.759> once<00:02:06.149> you've

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
patch that you can apply and once you've

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
patch that you can apply and once you've
applied<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.719> patch<00:02:07.049> then<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
applied that patch then you have the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.240 
applied that patch then you have the
32-bit<00:02:09.119> bootloader<00:02:09.690> working<00:02:10.500> audio<00:02:10.830> working

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
32-bit bootloader working audio working

wife
working<00:02:12.050> bluetooth<00:02:12.460> working<00:02:13.460> pretty<00:02:13.670> much

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
working bluetooth working pretty much

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.150 
working bluetooth working pretty much
everything<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.960> only<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.770> only<00:02:15.800> trick<00:02:16.130> is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
everything the only the only trick is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.070 
everything the only the only trick is
that<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.490> need<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.970> go<00:02:17.600> into<00:02:17.780> your<00:02:17.930> settings

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
that you need to go into your settings

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.770 
that you need to go into your settings
and<00:02:18.500> basically<00:02:18.770> hit<00:02:18.950> f10<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.730> choose<00:02:20.210> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and basically hit f10 and choose the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.630 
and basically hit f10 and choose the
grub<00:02:20.990> bootloader<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.860> way<00:02:22.130> every<00:02:22.460> time<00:02:22.490> you

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
grub bootloader that way every time you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.180 
grub bootloader that way every time you
want<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.940> load<00:02:23.090> -<00:02:23.240> boom<00:02:23.390> -<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:24.590> we've

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
want to load - boom - what we've

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.920 
want to load - boom - what we've
actually<00:02:25.430> done<00:02:25.640> here<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:26.030> installed<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.630> boon<00:02:26.750> -

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
actually done here is installed a boon -

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.080 
actually done here is installed a boon -
to<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> micro<00:02:27.680> SD<00:02:28.070> card<00:02:28.370> which<00:02:28.610> means<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.030> we

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
to a micro SD card which means that we

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.250 
to a micro SD card which means that we
haven't<00:02:29.390> touched<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.780> windows<00:02:30.080> software

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
haven't touched the windows software

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.230 
haven't touched the windows software
that's<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> computer<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:31.850> we<00:02:32.000> have

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
that's on the computer but we have

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.390 
that's on the computer but we have
altered<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.750> bootloader<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:33.980> can<00:02:34.190> boot

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
altered the bootloader so I can boot

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880 
altered the bootloader so I can boot
into<00:02:34.550> Windows<00:02:35.210> or<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:35.900> anytime<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.350> want

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
into Windows or go into anytime I want

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.050 
into Windows or go into anytime I want
but<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.310> want<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.550> get<00:02:37.640> rid<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.940> that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
but if I want to get rid of that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.760 
but if I want to get rid of that
bootloader<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.690> grub<00:02:38.900> bootloader<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.440> just

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
bootloader that grub bootloader and just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.680 
bootloader that grub bootloader and just
use<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> Windows<00:02:40.310> boot<00:02:40.490> loader<00:02:40.760> because<00:02:41.600> I've

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
use the Windows boot loader because I've

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
use the Windows boot loader because I've
decided<00:02:41.930> I'm<00:02:42.110> done<00:02:42.290> with<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> boon<00:02:42.680> -<00:02:42.830> then

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
decided I'm done with the boon - then

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.710 
decided I'm done with the boon - then
you<00:02:43.640> need<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.880> follow<00:02:44.060> some<00:02:44.240> more<00:02:44.390> commands

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
you need to follow some more commands

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.360 
you need to follow some more commands

the<00:03:41.760> black<00:03:41.970> screen<00:03:42.330> I'm<00:03:42.570> gonna<00:03:42.750> go<00:03:42.900> ahead<00:03:42.960> and

theoretically<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:46.800> could<00:03:46.920> boot<00:03:47.100> into<00:03:47.250> Windows

theoretically I could boot into Windows
without<00:03:47.820> doing<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:48.930> back

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
without doing this it's just to get back

but from here even though there's only
one<00:03:55.830> option<00:03:56.010> we're<00:03:56.340> going<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.550> choose<00:03:56.820> that

one<00:03:57.150> option<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.860> then<00:03:58.860> we<00:03:58.980> have<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> choice

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
one option and then we have the choice

one option and then we have the choice
of<00:03:59.490> going<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> boon<00:04:00.210> -<00:04:00.360> which<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.690> the
