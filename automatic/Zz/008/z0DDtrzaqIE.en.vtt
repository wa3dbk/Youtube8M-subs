00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.029
 speaks guys who says he's a wizard plate 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.100
 arrow clans bringing another video 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.140
 For you of that our playlist attack 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.510
 war commented on this video to 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.820
 continuation of the 20th war that was 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.920
 Epic galley was way off we already have one 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.900
 video on the channel on this the first 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.220
 attacks that evolve in this war and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.260
 I'll bring it here for you then. 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.030
 land-based attacks by bringing 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.620
 attack as the divine epicenter 10 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.390
 then the first attack was made on this 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.190
 village here a village center 10 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.040
 practically with maximum defenses 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.290
 all 2 thousand chickens level 3 all 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.629
 heads at level 4 all the actions more 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.940
 at level 8 mortars maximum level 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.860
 level 8 also all level 12 cannon 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.440
 all things here at level 12 so 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.870
 The priest is well, and then a 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.269
 attack and came to have a bit different 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.549
 than I usually show than the 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.519
 usually the staff makes me start 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:06.010
 with three blogs and soon after the game gones 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.200
 But I'll try to explain why. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.420
 I made the entry of fisheries on 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.820
 skinny for you this bible like you 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.950
 can see the layout of it it a bit 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.810
 different you strained these walls in the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.340
 which will make it difficult to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.979
 my troops do not let a little more 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.960
 slow thinking that my goals will go 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.609
 for the first defense they see me 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.409
 could be very well placed here in this 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.049
 to get on this truck and the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.210
 side of the same thing in this fucking thing here 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.340
 but if I do it both goals here 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.920
 I get very spread out and quickly 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.329
 they would fall from 2030 according to already 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.939
 would have no more votes on the sides 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.170
 understood I need hours then the idea 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.479
 that I had was the following I put 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.090
 three blogs one at each end in the center 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.070
 three pecs behind the good ones because 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.229
 probably these pieces will not stay 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.969
 paste in the blog since the goals go in 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.770
 direction to the nearest defenses then 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.689
 This one is now coming towards the tower. 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.310
 and equalize here towards 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.740
 to him be glory and cannon toward 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.299
 This fucking piece is going to come back. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.880
 of the goal then for the time being all 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.909
 defenses look gomes but once up 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.410
 start making these buildings here 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.810
 saw some wizards ago to be able to 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.400
 help with attack power and is to give 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 speed in attack after I 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.670
 I got to put all marketing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.500
 on the line of attack behind the goals of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 Goes and also my position here the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.910
 Clan castle or even the couple heroes 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.819
 next step would be to enter with the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.680
 usual white on these points here because 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.870
 my buttons as soon as this tower 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.569
 fall do not get stuck in this world 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.730
 So he does not come back here. 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.560
 very important that you have a worker here 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.000
 this first tower wants very much 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.209
 will probably look at my 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.930
 sin like that cannon here 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.880
 also because that's how it went wrong 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.590
 are a little more he could not 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.260
 look pro bono and go look straight at pec 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.940
 so if I put the mages here 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.890
 quickly these magicians would die 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.930
 jade lose attack power so 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.239
 I then placed aspects before the wizards 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.819
 It's after we move forward a little 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.010
 plus the troops and the workers to make 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.110
 these walls here the goianos will advance 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.000
 and the next defense looked to the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.799
 boys do not look at pec then til it goes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.660
 make a sindtanque paper very fast 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.610
 then there is a waste to use the earth 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.410
 as a tank troop but in this case the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.599
 what if I needed then 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.260
 the suitcases just behind the bon pec 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:25.730
 call him the troops of the castle places the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.950
 my hero couple made this thunder 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.109
 that I said already calls you used break only 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.150
 making the cleaning indicated here 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.410
 numbers already releasing that the two 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.750
 goals 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.489
 here I put the spell punish spell 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.910
 the cure the freeze not to detonate 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.040
 my max a fury spell now for 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.100
 give a gas in these two magicians here more 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.459
 This queen wants a bomb to power. 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.620
 disturbing my more peaceful life is the 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.389
 golem the two goalkeepers as the man fell 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.829
 two small bollards and the two guards 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.220
 attracted a great deal of attention, 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.470
 Hell has now helped one of my wizards 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.730
 looking divine percent and my 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.680
 career in the meantime. 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.720
 car tip can see that that goal 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.940
 and just died now in before him 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.430
 die all the mages here still 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.430
 together with 11 my wife and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.739
 now kayak in akira is that idea 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.450
 What I said about putting a piece for a 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.459
 little moment as a troop tank after 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.079
 how did pps work out you see she still 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.599
 she is alive she was like the tank of the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.240
 attack but for a brief moment and she 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.099
 helped 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.370
 the speed of attack then 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.690
 Depending on layout it is important that you 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.310
 understand the layout if it is possible to do 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.940
 This is just because it will not be running 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.349
 lina was planned this is more the idea 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.120
 was to give speed in the attack a 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.639
 business here would hardly do three 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 stars with heroes level 20 1 so 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.509
 I put so respects by 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.380
 and one in the center and the seas in 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.750
 behind line 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.949
 the second attack was done in this 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.819
 second row here I make a line 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.400
 also with three balls to get there from 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.190
 from the top or the center at the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.380
 down here already puts the mages 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.110
 because in this life would not fit much 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.650
 well that 's my strategy he is 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.819
 put the three stones already entered 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.990
 with what is love after a 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.000
 mortar exploded there 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.560
 At this moment I have a thunderclap. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.479
 I just wait for the flag I want 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.430
 release the thunder spell but I do not 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.900
 had done this causes a type to wait 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.130
 everybody get out there to freeze him 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.409
 along with the hell actor 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.819
 This took a huge amount of time from my 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.620
 troops who were looking at the 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.199
 Castle troops before arriving in 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.030
 Tower hell there and when resurfaces 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.949
 hell she already faces the goals scored 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.020
 he is losing many troops here 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.840
 together with some noises that were 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.009
 Then it got in the way. 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.610
 quite the attack 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.380
 in addition to this land also economy 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.969
 ask what level 5 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.190
 I'll get to the center should 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.560
 I'll be able to clean the center, right? 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.449
 but below this pec are here 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.940
 making that role for me of make 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.560
 between tank quotes was also allowed 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.120
 put of the castle from which just below 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.490
 to help her here but I stayed 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.380
 so focused in the center because I do not 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.120
 expected that Castle planet 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.159
 I lost the castle team from my plan 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.199
 that I would play down there 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.789
 then as I had already done 50% already had 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.830
 made a star decided to put only 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.509
 crack below to increase a little bit 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.169
 the percentage of distribution since this 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.180
 defender is looking at my goal and there it is. 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.990
 only I think it's a good one here. 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.060
 Clan vocation and fuck is already over 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.259
 that the attack is good there for 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.139
 disrupt life too 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:33.270
 but it was beauty two stars downtown 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.910
 10 life is not easy to do three stars 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.040
 goal the team center of old village 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.830
 It is necessary that you have a couple of 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.980
 grooms very high level high level will be the 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.690
 35 more I think to do 11 3 stars 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.100
 nice and haiti would be more or less 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.600
 that 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.010
 so this is it people if you liked it 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.660
 do not stop clicking on the taste below 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.610
