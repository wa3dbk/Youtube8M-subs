00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
every few of blink-182 then you want to

look this song up and learn to play so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:36.050 
look this song up and learn to play so
slowly<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:21.390> sounds<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:34.640> would<00:02:35.640> recommend

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
slowly it sounds like I would recommend

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.980 
slowly it sounds like I would recommend
for<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:40.290> use<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:41.090> clean<00:02:42.090> setting<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.780> your

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
for this to use a clean setting on your

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.980 
for this to use a clean setting on your
amp<00:02:43.140> instead<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> overdrive<00:02:44.300> or<00:02:45.300> distortion

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
amp instead of a overdrive or distortion

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.760 
amp instead of a overdrive or distortion
setting<00:02:46.350> because<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:50.370> last<00:02:50.640> chord<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.330> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
setting because that last chord on the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.650 
setting because that last chord on the
it<00:02:52.770> sounds<00:02:53.130> better<00:02:53.250> clean<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> does<00:02:54.300> over

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
it sounds better clean and it does over

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.420 
it sounds better clean and it does over
driven<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.980> way<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.160> get<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.340> more

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
driven so that way you get a more

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.140 
driven so that way you get a more
cleaner<00:03:01.490> approach<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.830> again<00:03:05.150> this

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
cleaner approach to it so again this

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.580 
cleaner approach to it so again this
riff<00:03:06.680> for<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.800> song<00:03:08.010> looks<00:03:08.280> like
