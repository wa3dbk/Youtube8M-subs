00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
um okay so um subversion asks a question

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
um okay so um subversion asks a question
about<00:00:07.799> when<00:00:08.190> promise<00:00:08.580> tried<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.940> break<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
about when promise tried to break the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.419 
about when promise tried to break the
crawler<00:00:09.780> wall<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.349> encountered<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.860> big<00:00:11.130> roach

immediately<00:00:14.070> switching<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.059> muta<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.570> you

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
immediately switching to muta and you

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.450 
immediately switching to muta and you
know<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:16.170> actually<00:00:16.470> say<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.250> that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
know what I would actually say is that

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.359 
know what I would actually say is that
he<00:00:17.910> should<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.150> switched<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.630> muta<00:00:18.869> lisk

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
he should have switched to muta lisk

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.859 
he should have switched to muta lisk
years<00:00:20.369> beforehand<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.390> know<00:00:21.480> cuz<00:00:21.630> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
years beforehand you know cuz that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.310 
years beforehand you know cuz that
period<00:00:22.289> remember<00:00:22.920> how<00:00:23.930> when<00:00:24.930> those<00:00:25.080> roaches

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
period remember how when those roaches

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.259 
period remember how when those roaches
went<00:00:25.769> down<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.220> ramp<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> kill<00:00:26.820> off<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.939> spine

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
went down the ramp to kill off the spine

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
went down the ramp to kill off the spine
crawlers<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.949> reason<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.279> could<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
crawlers the reason they could do that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.250 
crawlers the reason they could do that
is<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.090> promise<00:00:30.630> had<00:00:30.750> made<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.930> bunch<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
is because promise had made a bunch of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.810 
is because promise had made a bunch of
banelings<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.099> go<00:00:32.189> try<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.400> kill<00:00:32.669> off<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
banelings to go try to kill off the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.840 
banelings to go try to kill off the
first<00:00:33.120> row<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.330> spine<00:00:33.629> crawlers<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.700> think<00:00:35.700> that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
first row of spine crawlers I think that

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.790 
first row of spine crawlers I think that
long<00:00:36.149> before<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> banelings<00:00:37.079> were<00:00:37.230> even<00:00:37.500> made

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
long before the banelings were even made

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
long before the banelings were even made
he<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.640> should<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.790> said<00:00:39.059> I'm

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
he actually just should have said I'm

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.970 
he actually just should have said I'm
not<00:00:39.329> making<00:00:39.870> banelings<00:00:40.260> i'm<00:00:40.379> getting<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.770> spire

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
not making banelings i'm getting a spire

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.500 
not making banelings i'm getting a spire
now<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.700> would<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:41.879> put<00:00:42.120> pressure

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
now because that would have put pressure

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.950 
now because that would have put pressure
on<00:00:42.719> artosis<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> ton<00:00:44.489> more<00:00:44.940> ways<00:00:45.270> any

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
on artosis in in a ton more ways any

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
on artosis in in a ton more ways any
time<00:00:46.290> you're<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.620> league<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> lead<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
time you're in a league in the lead you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.810 
time you're in a league in the lead you
should<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.780> um<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.649> expansions<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
should get um more expansions up you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
should get um more expansions up you
should<00:00:51.059> power<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.500> getting

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
should power more that's that is getting

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.319 
should power more that's that is getting
more<00:00:52.860> upgrades<00:00:53.219> getting<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.550> workers<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
more upgrades getting more workers and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
more upgrades getting more workers and
you<00:00:54.420> should<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:54.960> text<00:00:55.289> structures

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you should make some text structures

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.400 
you should make some text structures
that<00:00:55.860> will<00:00:55.980> freak<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.579> opponent<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.660> i

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that will freak your opponent out if i

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.209 
that will freak your opponent out if i

I<00:01:05.970> don't<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.409> hundred<00:01:07.830> new<00:01:08.130> dlist

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
I don't have to get a hundred new dlist

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.359 
I don't have to get a hundred new dlist
to<00:01:09.659> noodle<00:01:09.990> escs<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.830> course<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> my

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
to noodle escs and of course the my

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
to noodle escs and of course the my
spire<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> come<00:01:12.119> into<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.450> later<00:01:12.750> on

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
spire is going to come into use later on

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
spire is going to come into use later on
in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> game<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.650> works<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.920> well<00:01:14.189> those

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
in the game so it works out well those

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.100 
in the game so it works out well those
are<00:01:15.000> three<00:01:15.210> things<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.840> definitely

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
are three things that I would definitely

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.039 
are three things that I would definitely
absolutely<00:01:16.640> indubitably<00:01:18.110> recommend<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
absolutely indubitably recommend so so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.179 
absolutely indubitably recommend so so
so<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.500> um<00:01:23.540> competition<00:01:24.540> says<00:01:24.860> Mick<00:01:25.860> thought

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
so so um competition says Mick thought

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.390 
so so um competition says Mick thought
hammer<00:01:26.490> despite<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> fact<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> UM

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
hammer despite the fact that the UM

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.880 
hammer despite the fact that the UM
which<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.520> said<00:01:29.670> MC<00:01:29.939> thought<00:01:30.119> hammer<00:01:30.330> ha<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.960> got

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
which I said MC thought hammer ha I got

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
which I said MC thought hammer ha I got
the<00:01:32.009> joke<00:01:32.189> took<00:01:32.430> me<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> while<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.060> always

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the joke took me a while but I always

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.060 
the joke took me a while but I always
get<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> good<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.799> took<00:01:34.829> my

get there it's a good thing I took my

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
get there it's a good thing I took my
funny<00:01:35.310> detection<00:01:35.820> juice<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.150> morning<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
funny detection juice this morning so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.109 
funny detection juice this morning so
despite<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> fact<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> spines<00:01:38.700> were

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
despite the fact that the spines were

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.460 
despite the fact that the spines were
useful<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.659> game<00:01:39.930> don't<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> think

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
useful in this game don't you think

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
useful in this game don't you think
spending<00:01:40.740> 1200<00:01:41.310> minerals<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.670> spines<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
spending 1200 minerals on spines was a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.410 
spending 1200 minerals on spines was a
little<00:01:42.630> overreacting<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
little overreacting now that is it that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.490 
little overreacting now that is it that
is<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.409> question<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.189> asking<00:01:47.729> now

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
is the right question to be asking now

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.080 
is the right question to be asking now
the<00:01:49.500> reason<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.250> question<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the reason if the right question is that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
the reason if the right question is that
you<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.899> games<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.890> gonna

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you in your games you're gonna

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.960 
you in your games you're gonna
experience<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.939> crisis<00:01:54.899> where<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.710> go

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
experience a crisis where you just go

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.520 
experience a crisis where you just go
and<00:01:56.970> what's<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> happen<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.229> first

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and what's going to happen is your first

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.080 
and what's going to happen is your first
crisis<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> experience<00:01:59.700> you'll<00:01:59.880> probably

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
crisis you experience you'll probably

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.719 
crisis you experience you'll probably
under<00:02:00.630> prepare<00:02:01.020> you'll<00:02:01.860> probably<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.430> like

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
under prepare you'll probably make like

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.520 
under prepare you'll probably make like
you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.090> three<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.689> four<00:02:03.960> cannons<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you know three or four cannons when you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.660 
you know three or four cannons when you
should<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.740> made<00:02:04.890> eight<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.520> he'll

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
should have made eight and then he'll

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.800 
should have made eight and then he'll
just<00:02:05.790> run<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> kill<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.570> you're<00:02:06.719> just

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
just run in to kill you and you're just

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.560 
just run in to kill you and you're just
like<00:02:07.020> ahh<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.610> you'll<00:02:08.729> end<00:02:09.030> up<00:02:09.299> building

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
like ahh and then you'll end up building

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.809 
like ahh and then you'll end up building
you<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.019> up<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> eight<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:10.950> cannons<00:02:11.370> after

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you know up to eight or so cannons after

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.600 
you know up to eight or so cannons after
that<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.140> lot<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> really<00:02:14.250> good<00:02:14.400> players

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
that so a lot of really good players

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.800 
that so a lot of really good players
who've<00:02:14.970> had<00:02:15.060> years<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.420> cry

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
who've had years of cry

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.770 
who've had years of cry
this<00:02:15.900> management<00:02:16.489> never<00:02:17.489> get<00:02:17.910> less<00:02:18.330> than<00:02:18.630> that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
this management never get less than that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.720 
this management never get less than that
right<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.349> always<00:02:19.709> tend<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.069> overcompensate

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
right they always tend to overcompensate

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.120 
right they always tend to overcompensate
and<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.720> reason<00:02:22.020> why<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.170> love<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.830> question

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and the reason why I love this question

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.880 
and the reason why I love this question
is<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.940> what<00:02:24.239> it's<00:02:24.690> impossible<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.620> for

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
is that what it's impossible really for

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.710 
is that what it's impossible really for
artosis<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.520> look<00:02:26.670> at<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.910> situation<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
artosis to look at this situation and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.350 
artosis to look at this situation and
say<00:02:28.069> based<00:02:29.069> upon<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> Orochi<00:02:29.819> count<00:02:30.120> that

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
say based upon the Orochi count that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.940 
say based upon the Orochi count that
came<00:02:30.630> into<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:30.870> main<00:02:31.140> when<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> wasn't<00:02:31.709> even

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
came into my main when I wasn't even

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.530 
came into my main when I wasn't even
expecting<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.700> didn't<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:33.030> any<00:02:33.180> units<00:02:33.450> i

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
expecting it I didn't have any units i

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.940 
expecting it I didn't have any units i
think<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.870> i<00:02:33.900> should<00:02:33.959> get<00:02:34.230> aid<00:02:34.650> spine

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
think that i should get aid spine

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.009 
think that i should get aid spine
crawlers<00:02:35.310> instead<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.700> 12<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.450> hard<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
crawlers instead of 12 it's so hard to

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.509 
crawlers instead of 12 it's so hard to
make<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.560> sort<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.890> judgment<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
make that sort of judgment and

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.160 
make that sort of judgment and
especially<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.180> our<00:02:39.269> ptosis<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.930> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
especially for our ptosis to be that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.930 
especially for our ptosis to be that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
game what what you need to do is sure

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.190 
game what what you need to do is sure
overcompensate<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.959> way<00:02:46.050> they<00:02:46.170> are

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
overcompensate and the way they are

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.660 
overcompensate and the way they are
ptosis<00:02:46.560> did<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.830> then<00:02:46.920> look<00:02:47.069> back<00:02:47.250> artosis

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
ptosis did and then look back artosis

ptosis did and then look back artosis
will<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.150> probably<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.780> wow<00:02:49.500> yeah<00:02:49.830> probably

next<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.640> I'm<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.299> make<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.810> three

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
next time I'm going to make just three

it's<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.840> bgh<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.799> know<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.400> think<00:03:11.940> that

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
it's not bgh you know so I think that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.440 
it's not bgh you know so I think that
that<00:03:12.299> um<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.099> very<00:03:14.489> reasonable<00:03:15.090> thing

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that um that is a very reasonable thing

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.360 
that um that is a very reasonable thing
to<00:03:15.480> say<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.110> looks<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> was

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
to say is that looks like it was

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.319 
to say is that looks like it was
overreacting<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.330> us<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.090> moment

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
overreacting to us but in the moment

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.690 
overreacting to us but in the moment
it's<00:03:21.660> hard<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.019> tell<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.620> whenever<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.370> are<00:03:23.609> in

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
it's hard to tell so whenever you are in

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.069 
it's hard to tell so whenever you are in
a<00:03:23.760> game<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.090> hard<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.329> tell<00:03:24.540> definitely

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
a game it's hard to tell definitely

the overseers out of it for now because

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.629 
the overseers out of it for now because
I<00:03:52.019> want<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.260> keep<00:03:52.680> these<00:03:52.859> dailies<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> little

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
I want to keep these dailies a little

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.680 
I want to keep these dailies a little
shorter<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:55.760> now<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.910> fester<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> unit<00:03:58.049> that

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
shorter so now in fester is a unit that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.580 
shorter so now in fester is a unit that
bolsters<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.959> big<00:04:01.380> force<00:04:01.739> um<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.840> know<00:04:03.959> uh<00:04:04.139> in

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
bolsters the big force um you know uh in

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.940 
bolsters the big force um you know uh in
a<00:04:04.769> sense<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:06.720> kind<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.109> makes<00:04:07.380> your<00:04:07.650> roaches

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
a sense it kind of makes your roaches

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.379 
a sense it kind of makes your roaches
just<00:04:08.519> better<00:04:09.090> against<00:04:09.959> his<00:04:10.139> roaches<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:10.980> um

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
just better against his roaches it's um

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.940 
just better against his roaches it's um
getting<00:04:12.389> a<00:04:12.540> good<00:04:12.690> fungal<00:04:13.109> growth<00:04:13.319> off<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:13.859> your

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
getting a good fungal growth off on your

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.060 
getting a good fungal growth off on your
opponent's<00:04:14.400> massive<00:04:15.000> roaches<00:04:15.359> is<00:04:16.070> almost

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
opponent's massive roaches is almost

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.770 
opponent's massive roaches is almost
like<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.760> regular<00:04:17.910> super<00:04:18.419> roaches

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
like you just have regular super roaches

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.159 
like you just have regular super roaches
so<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:20.100> um<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.810> case<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.380> feel<00:04:23.340> like

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
so that's um in that case I feel like

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.480 
so that's um in that case I feel like
that's<00:04:25.169> what<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.380> would<00:04:25.470> call<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.919> straight-up

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
that's what I would call a straight-up

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.850 
that's what I would call a straight-up
game<00:04:27.030> right

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
game right

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.550 
game right
he<00:04:29.159> is<00:04:29.280> saying<00:04:29.520> well<00:04:29.909> my<00:04:30.360> army<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:30.960> roaches<00:04:31.409> is

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
he is saying well my army of roaches is

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.939 
he is saying well my army of roaches is
really<00:04:32.069> strong<00:04:32.699> and<00:04:32.759> huge<00:04:33.469> let<00:04:34.469> me<00:04:34.560> make<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.770> a

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
really strong and huge let me make it a

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.279 
really strong and huge let me make it a
little<00:04:34.979> stronger<00:04:35.789> by<00:04:36.150> getting<00:04:36.539> investors<00:04:37.139> or

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
little stronger by getting investors or

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.959 
little stronger by getting investors or
getting<00:04:37.530> upgrades<00:04:38.129> or<00:04:38.280> tell<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:38.729> getting

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
getting upgrades or tell just getting

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.080 
getting upgrades or tell just getting
more<00:04:39.120> roaches<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:40.169> straight<00:04:40.680> up<00:04:40.830> army<00:04:41.219> but<00:04:42.000> the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
more roaches so straight up army but the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.580 
more roaches so straight up army but the
reason<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.389> brood<00:04:42.659> lords<00:04:42.990> are<00:04:43.080> pretty<00:04:43.319> cool

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
reason the brood lords are pretty cool

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.719 
reason the brood lords are pretty cool
is<00:04:43.919> that<00:04:44.330> they<00:04:45.330> make<00:04:45.569> it<00:04:45.780> almost<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.979> completely

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
is that they make it almost a completely

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.939 
is that they make it almost a completely
new<00:04:47.939> style<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.509> army<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.139> not<00:04:49.319> just<00:04:49.379> roaches

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
new style of army it's not just roaches

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.969 
new style of army it's not just roaches
it's<00:04:50.460> roaches<00:04:50.969> and<00:04:51.120> air<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.439> does<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.680> ton<00:04:52.919> of

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
it's roaches and air that does a ton of

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.999 
it's roaches and air that does a ton of
damage<00:04:53.479> so<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.569> need<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.110> have<00:04:55.229> a<00:04:55.289> lot<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.560> anti

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
damage so you need to have a lot of anti

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.830 
damage so you need to have a lot of anti
air<00:04:56.159> so<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.400> will<00:04:56.610> screw<00:04:57.479> up<00:04:57.509> your

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
air so that will screw up your

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.350 
air so that will screw up your
opponent's<00:04:58.259> unit<00:04:58.860> composition<00:04:59.430> hugely<00:05:00.000> and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
opponent's unit composition hugely and

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.379 
opponent's unit composition hugely and
we<00:05:00.780> saw<00:05:01.110> in<00:05:01.379> this<00:05:01.590> game<00:05:02.000> promise<00:05:03.000> how<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.180> make

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
we saw in this game promise how to make

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.240 
we saw in this game promise how to make
all<00:05:03.569> these<00:05:03.840> muta<00:05:04.139> lists<00:05:04.439> that<00:05:04.650> I'm<00:05:04.830> pretty

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
all these muta lists that I'm pretty

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.749 
all these muta lists that I'm pretty
sure<00:05:05.460> he<00:05:05.610> would<00:05:05.789> have<00:05:05.819> rather<00:05:06.180> not<00:05:06.569> made<00:05:07.400> so<00:05:08.400> um

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
sure he would have rather not made so um

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.330 
sure he would have rather not made so um
just<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.569> contrast<00:05:09.810> this<00:05:10.349> imagine<00:05:11.129> if<00:05:11.219> you're

a straight-up army but if you're really

really far behind let's say you're
tearing<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:32.099> got<00:05:32.250> screwed<00:05:32.580> up<00:05:32.849> rather<00:05:33.419> than

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
tearing you got screwed up rather than

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.320 
tearing you got screwed up rather than
making<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.960> ravens<00:05:34.409> which<00:05:34.589> will<00:05:34.830> naturally
