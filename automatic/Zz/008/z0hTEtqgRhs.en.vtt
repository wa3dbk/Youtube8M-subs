00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.190
 that as a matter and look at something 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.190
 lures her sculpted apart 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 yes this is my troupe here so people 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 get laying to another episode 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 and yes we see here all right because 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.189
 this is not the nexus farm world 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 yes exactly namely the eleven names on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 sunday the next board right then 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 when I'm not in it again 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.110
 Of course, I'm super angel again 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.540
 now two in a row has none 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.559
 extreme I did not come there was that lies 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.739
 no longer grab that I really 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.210
 just do not I were at home could 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.379
 me the biggest apology at 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.579
 next there is not in any case 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.050
 I am definitely at home 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.820
 So there should be something in the short term 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 in between, we have to go next 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 Color means significantly more raw materials 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.489
 So that's definitely very good 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.629
 and yes I had another one each 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.629
 report because tell 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 yes, because we have a bit 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.640
 namely, discussion 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.939
 and with us is a part of the house 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.289
 be demolished because that is not so 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.820
 my king , however, probably not well 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.200
 but because the king of the area I 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.200
 say what I mean 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.399
 so also children for unapproved 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 At first we painted that we build that 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.500
 allowed 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.880
 although nobody actually builds something 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.409
 Yes, that's exactly what's new 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 King , we were probably on 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.909
 the jogi win and still around the mac 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.909
 tear down further 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.490
 yes I'll show you something because that's it 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.420
 my spectators as well as world cup winners 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.640
 have done a little more everything and that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.390
 unfortunately was away this for myself 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.649
 sorry or track me now 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.649
 or apparently 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.390
 niklas to the classics namely one 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.769
 huge automatic farm is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.760
 semi-automatic of a huge white one 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.950
 colors as well as sets wants to leave 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.319
 somehow we do not have to go after that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.590
 It did not seem exactly so beautiful 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.239
 So I was completely defined 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.610
 well but it was like I was outside 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.530
 in the beginning it was because we already had one 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.060
 big farm have the results but no 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.700
 We can do it ourselves 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.319
 what is now in the final stages was well 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 because that's just not the style of the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.150
 Elves corresponds that means that should be yes 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.549
 as of dwarfs also not as of 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.769
 coffins from the seeds of elves so 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.310
 no idea of ​​course that you have something 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.780
 boxy etc and there has the character that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.690
 it also understandable so far though 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.209
 First of all there is a lot of work in it 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.739
 very much work device yes and 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.629
 secondly you can adapt everything and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.480
 third, because mister of the rings is a group of films 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.859
 bt group own gelaber I'm just 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.200
 now distance one hears that always one 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:24.560
 a little bit before even today so small 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.280
 for decentralized one sees yes on the 11 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.840
 märgen wohnen.de more so 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.889
 niklas cascada gained the degree of violence 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.889
 stood manuel k tron 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.310
 so 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.959
 I would like 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.069
 completely under 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.959
 probably 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.200
 I'll come first and then up 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.200
 then 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:24.560
 I have my room one up here 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:26.570
 little other field happened i am 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:39.620
 hoping to return eat live here 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:42.580
 freddie fox clubs provide one now 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.580
 show own room 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.270
 yes in any case meanwhile the elves 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:57.260
 are pretty strong that is yes 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:06.169
 that is very uphill with the goes 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:13.210
 just in tokyo but i'm wrong 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.210
 Floor there is my room ok 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.660
 a nice plate but three savor 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.130
 took 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.980
 didi hamann in foreign people with me 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.440
 Kisten actually can not break it down 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.860
 that always has stupid access 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.010
 stupid yes in any case that you in 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.990
 The consequence is that you are a bit of a little something 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.880
 what happened to her is happening and 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.990
 I would just say we see each other 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.990
 right next time again
