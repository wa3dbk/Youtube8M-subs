00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.620
 good to everyone again here we are in 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.269
 another video from my channel that does not have almost 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.349
 no subscribers but thank you very much 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.260
 to those who have subscribed until now 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.809
 we were I think three subscribers and 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.449
 Now we are already I think we are already 10 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.910
 I believe and this one is on this occasion 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.300
 I'm going to show you some things that 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.869
 I did not mention the other video 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.760
 from the evening collection number 9 of 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.059
 possession of the xbox minecraft title 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.469
 360 this good so let's start 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.329
 now let's see one of the but 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.609
 things more possible things that can be 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.979
 help remember that remember that in 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.049
 the departure date the possible dates 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:47.329
 of departures according to my predictions could 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:49.519
 be on Tuesday February 26, 2013 or 5 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.139
 March 2013 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.660
 there is only one different week there is only 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:59.950
 a week apart 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.950
 I do not think it takes longer this and then 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.180
 Well, let's start 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.619
 good 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.590
 and there may be many many 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.390
 building blocks I can not 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.270
 tell them all because until now 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.640
 these are the only ones that I have investigated 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.780
 that more or less could come in the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.270
 procession 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.759
 this is the lamp that serves most as 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.680
 for the decoration the lighthouse that is 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.200
 to improve your 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.659
 to improve your weapons your tools 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.789
 and that is 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.700
 to increase your speed it's as if 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.140
 you were taking a position 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.760
 but these things serve you for many 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.710
 things 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.590
 everyone has been mentioned are between 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.020
 the video that is the core of the portal 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.370
 portal flame to activate the portal of the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.230
 leander to kill the ugly dragon good 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.790
 this the goals that I do not know or why 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.200
 if they do not add it because I do not know what and for 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.540
 what's the use, I think it's good for 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.290
 exchange with the villagers I think but 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.510
 it's also just that being able to come 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.810
 to negotiate with the villagers possibly 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.550
 because it can be ours the anvil that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.580
 is the favorite that is to improve your 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.950
 acts your firepower your weapons 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.420
 so you do not run out because if 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.700
 they have a charm 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.320
 for example if you love the weapon and you 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.610
 I really like that charm , you do not want 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.780
 lose your weapon simply because the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.130
 improvements with the experience that you have 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.600
 earned good then the portal to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.319
 that the chest understands that it is minimal is 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 for 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.980
 and cofrentes serves you for many things 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.980
 in main for adventure maps 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.709
 wait for me 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.500
 but it's not that giving code is good 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.500
 of flu right now I just gave 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.140
 the stone that is in that chest and is 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.550
 as if he were teleporting 2 and it's 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.660
 as if these two chests were 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.840
 united long distance here is the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.840
 stone 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.480
 I have already told them, possibly they will come 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.190
 many many more with many more 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.310
 decoration things I'm not 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.080
 assuring you all this there are faces 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.930
 remain to disappear things touches 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.120
 hurry up good this the little box that is 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.950
 for the decorations more or less to me 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.140
 If I really like things 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.790
 well here was a meal that no no 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.830
 I remember that it was here was another 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.080
 food that did not go down that was good since 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.790
 I'm going to leave the food from here the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.769
 carrot 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.019
 many meals could be added 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.120
 many meals I think that this 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.349
 it would be the next update more 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.060
 big this and I think it's a month is 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.260
 enough time to finish is 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.470
 an update of 3 or 5 megabytes 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.510
 because it is not easy I understand very 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.420
 well that is not easy at all so 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.730
 add and do things but this me 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.700
 I think it 's enough time one month 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.590
 like to have that update ready 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.300
 good 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.760
 mainly this is what the 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.980
 food that fucking shit disappeared 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.380
 good one thing that was not added in the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.250
 update number 7 because the 8 only 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.830
 it was an error update this from 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.810
 box fix and then this production 8 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.260
 it was just a solution of errors of 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.550
 small and tiny mistakes 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.500
 and well, he 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.660
 update number 9 is the one that goes to 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.500
 have the content is not going to be any 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.500
 bug fix 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.729
 this turn 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.139
 the iron golem is the fourteenth century what 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.880
 they are going to add to you and that's it 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.880
 confirmed the goal of iron 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.039
 in the other video I had already explained 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.370
 of the famous ones that is to take the 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.979
 context but 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.479
 these things that are to appear to the 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.979
 monsters the eggs the creative mode 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.610
 the eggs had already explained them 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.979
 in the other video 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.249
 good friends this this particularly 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.199
 it's not all this is not 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.179
 I think more or less these blocks 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.049
 are those that may possibly come further 

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:20.049
 of the macabre 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.130
 and these can not be all the blocks 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020
 I say that will come much more 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.750
 click update I think bigger 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.850
 in addition to the 1.8 points 2 that I think that 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.850
 it was the six lots the 51 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.640
 good friends remember that the date 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.960
 is on February 26 , 2013 and can be 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.760
 on March 5 , 2013, only you 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.140
 they could find out what they remember there's only 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.770
 a week apart and they could not 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.770
 take a long time 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.610
 another thing that I want to tell you is that 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.170
 the 4 photos of you are talking about 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.540
 turn the most realistic minecraft or 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.550
 is to put content higher 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.220
 definition I say that could 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.080
 possibly be an update of hd 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.600
 high definition I'm not too sure 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.200
 but it's pretty much something about that this 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.810
 they are trying to put high definition 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.830
 for billboards that could not 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.810
 look in high definition 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.280
 I have a high definition TV and 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.570
 for me there is no problem I am going to be 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.570
 have it but I say it 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.490
 possibly program a content of 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.270
 High Definition 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.120
 another thing possibly did not assure us 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.550
 nothing or nothing 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.639
 the farc texts I have read many news 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.260
 of downloadable content and then in this 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.410
 there are already two of four photos of you 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.150
 I assure you that you are already working in 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.460
 text the support pack to support the 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.319
 texts so that in the 360 version 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.370
 good friends that has been all that is 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.600
 all the information that you can 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.169
 provide until now what I have 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.700
 missed if I can find more 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.530
 information about d 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.810
 another news about the realization of 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.680
 a 9 brings them with pleasure for 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:14.460
 please give it a thumbs up if and then my 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.100
 game by me and gamertag is predators sh1 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.540
 I'll leave all the information I'll leave 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.100
 in the description of the video if not 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.100
 they understood very well this 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.250
 and then we are already in the next 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.250
 video
