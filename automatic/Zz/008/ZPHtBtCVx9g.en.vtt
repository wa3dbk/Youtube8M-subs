00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi to all and balsan case i hope that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.170
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.269
 nickel so today in this video 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 I will introduce you to the luxury swift 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.630
 so the solid gold helicopter that's just 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460
 behind me so it's a helicopter that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.210
 costs more than $ 5 million including 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.039
 what is not given 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.690
 and in addition so there are no small 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.789
 particularities as we could see the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.350
 luxury gold one could smoke a cigar and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.519
 have a drink at the back 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 in this one there will be nothing 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.380
 so that's gone we'll go up to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.730
 interior 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.840
 I will try to climb from 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.550
 behind to be able to be hop 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 this is to be able to see if he 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.030
 there is something there so magnificent 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670
 look, we'll go to the first 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.399
 nobody and we can see that there is 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 champagne and you can surf the internet 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 in the helicopter that we could not in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 in the plane we could not here we can 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 either drink champagne or surf 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.760
 internet to frankly I find that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.989
 it's pretty stylish sometimes it's true 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.649
 we get a little we get bored a little 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.449
 as to the little ones 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.250
 he pilots in helicopter there is that the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.079
 driver having fun there at least 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.219
 behind you can have fun either 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.230
 drink a little champagne or 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.250
 so browse the internet you can 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.140
 really do what you want I 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.549
 think it's really stylish so 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.320
 as I said in the video of the plane 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.369
 after that, it's safe to pay as much 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.689
 for ben to be able to have small 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.299
 options like that maybe it's not 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.140
 super great but it's a little more 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.060
 do not spit on it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.939
 hopla after that's sure it's not so 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 here are these voices here I can go out my 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.070
 phone go on the internet with my 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.590
 phone 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 so it's true it's not it's not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 a crazy option but it's a small 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.159
 more frankly I find it's about 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.350
 the same is a little more beautiful to be 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 and it's really unique to helicopters 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.520
 luxury and so we follow outside 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.310
 that's how it is all gold 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 with the little my little private chauffeur 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 coastal sir game thank you to you so 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.140
 the elite helicopter while out with 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.920
 little black stripes like that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 frankly I think it's done 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.170
 really stylish after having a little 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.930
 more played suddenly we could see that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 the blow the helicopter and the plane are 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.909
 a little more armored than normal 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.350
 and it's nice to see that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.469
 down the vehicles are a lot more 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.759
 resisting so then small conclusion 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.520
 So I think these two vehicles 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.829
 luxury tallow and luxury beyond luxury 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.819
 are vehicles to buy when we 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.019
 is really armored 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.120
 for those who do not have much 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.159
 instead, buy the vehicles 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.200
 like the gas peace osiris which is 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.730
 really monstrous it will be frankly 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.349
 I think it's the best choice and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.760
 then progressively in the game 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.769
 when you have done more robberies 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.540
 and you will have accumulated dollars 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.650
 there you can buy them but 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.670
 frankly if you have a choice to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.680
 do not buy the two there 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.629
 rather take the vehicles so the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.459
 new cars that are beautiful 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.590
 they are really cool and that costs 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.000
 a lot less expensive 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.079
 and here we come to the end of the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.500
 video I really hope she will you 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.329
 will have pleased 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.650
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.659
 blue if that's the case there is subscribe 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.709
 if it's not already done and that's me 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.389
 I will leave you in these pictures 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.959
 enjoy the dlc frankly it is 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.150
 really cool 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.609
 despite being quite expensive after that it's 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 it's a bit of the role of the dlc it's a 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.730
 dlc is badly acquired 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.889
 So it's a bit normal that everything 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.510
 expensive and so that's me I wanted 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.049
 That's it I tell you all good game and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.049
 keep everyone
