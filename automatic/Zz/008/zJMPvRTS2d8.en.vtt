00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.439
 and therefore also welcome here 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.500
 to the tutorial for the carport in minecraft 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.090
 yes now this chamber and you can see 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.690
 right here right now 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.110
 What he does so you can only 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.609
 say drive car and the whole in 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.439
 breathtaking speeds the 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.329
 Car even needs proper gasoline though 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.609
 as more work has to be 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.229
 Now continue 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.609
 This car consists essentially of 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.370
 share three 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.530
 3 strong processes on the one hand needs 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.179
 her tires of the car which countered 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.639
 by putting an iron block in the middle 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.379
 lies outside and therefore sorts songs on 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.690
 all crafting recipes are here now 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.729
 but also and wants to see then needs 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.129
 you still the engine of the forces that 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.010
 land torch one oven one redstone 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.079
 two slopes and at the end you can go out 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.330
 So these two share the engine and 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.210
 then the wheels and in the wheel 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.240
 finished car shape down there in the middle 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.060
 An iron above the engine a box 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.450
 david spit coal in and then done it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.550
 Also an iron ingo every automotor 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.500
 has to be powered by something 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.390
 so also this car in minecraft the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.350
 get in the car and push it 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.570
 this opens the author's main inventory 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.820
 norbert left on and found there you can 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.070
 then either she became coal or wood 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.170
 a few that does not work on everyone 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.450
 So try over any 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.370
 make a try and grab coal 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.260
 pure is then lost during the 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.570
 but you have to say it takes time 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.640
 but quite a long biting icon 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.290
 report I lost 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 if you have then added coal is 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.210
 news or chat something so 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.270
 that the car network is loaded and you 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.550
 You can start the program three times 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.860
 control of the car that does not make you 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.990
 as always who looks where this place 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.509
 wants to suppress but with the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.610
 what the actually as always 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.539

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.989
