which we named it request and of our

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200 
which we named it request and of our
bracket<00:05:07.560> in<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.710> semicolon<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.520> press<00:05:08.700> ENTER

bracket in a semicolon and press ENTER

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.970 
bracket in a semicolon and press ENTER
and<00:05:09.630> then<00:05:09.870> we<00:05:09.960> do<00:05:10.110> again<00:05:10.560> bracket<00:05:11.460> webview<00:05:12.090> and

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
and then we do again bracket webview and

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.750 
and then we do again bracket webview and
we're<00:05:13.980> gonna<00:05:14.130> set<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.990> page<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.490> fit

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
we're gonna set the page to fit

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.750 
we're gonna set the page to fit
so<00:05:18.240> basically<00:05:18.720> when<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.320> PDF<00:05:20.070> loads<00:05:20.460> into<00:05:20.700> our

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
so basically when the PDF loads into our

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.970 
so basically when the PDF loads into our
web<00:05:20.940> view<00:05:21.180> it's<00:05:21.630> not<00:05:21.840> all<00:05:21.990> tacitly<00:05:22.470> zoomed<00:05:22.740> in

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.670 
it's like in the simulator it of the
whole<00:05:26.280> view<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:26.669> basically<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.780> fits<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.530> page

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
whole view so basically it fits the page

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.460 
whole view so basically it fits the page
kind<00:05:29.040> of<00:05:29.190> thing<00:05:29.310> so<00:05:30.090> do<00:05:30.330> set<00:05:32.090> scales<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.720> skip

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
kind of thing so do set scales to skip

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.400 
kind of thing so do set scales to skip
set<00:05:35.070> scales<00:05:35.430> page<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:36.180> fit<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.840> then<00:05:37.139> we<00:05:37.260> do

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
set scales page to fit and then we do

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.990 
set scales page to fit and then we do
yes<00:05:38.210> there<00:05:39.919> we<00:05:40.919> can<00:05:41.070> simply<00:05:41.370> say<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.729> you<00:05:41.760> can

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
yes there we can simply say that you can

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.180 
yes there we can simply say that you can
you<00:05:42.690> can<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.410> type<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.590> line<00:05:43.830> there<00:05:44.070> you

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
you can have to type that line there you

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.820 
you can have to type that line there you
can<00:05:44.340> simply<00:05:44.550> go<00:05:44.669> into<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.530> interface<00:05:46.530> builder

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
can simply go into the interface builder

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
can simply go into the interface builder
and<00:05:47.130> select<00:05:47.460> page<00:05:47.880> fit<00:05:48.300> scaled<00:05:49.640> but<00:05:50.640> once

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
and select page fit scaled but once

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.950 
and select page fit scaled but once
we've<00:05:51.000> done<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.180> we<00:05:51.450> can<00:05:51.570> go<00:05:51.600> straight<00:05:51.870> to

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
we've done that we can go straight to

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.180 
we've done that we can go straight to
build<00:05:52.470> run<00:05:52.650> run<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:55.320> that's<00:05:55.470> is<00:05:55.710> it<00:05:55.830> loads<00:05:56.070> up

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190
