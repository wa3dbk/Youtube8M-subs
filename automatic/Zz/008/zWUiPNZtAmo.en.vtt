00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.290
 very good guys hello that such a new 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.220
 class of music theory course 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.550
 number 11 today let's see what the 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.610
 theme of the three threads the three seals 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.730
 what they are and what they are for 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.560
 well remember that in the fourth 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.610
 class I think it was the fourth or the fifth 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.920
 we had seen the issue of the values ​​of 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.480
 the musical figures the values ​​of the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.520
 notes and we had for example a round 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.790
 inside a round two white enter 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.080
 and inside each white enter 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.080
 two black 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.170
 and within each black enter 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.130
 two eighth notes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.380
 ok good 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.380
 what we are going to do is the following 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.740
 with the theme of the three stamps we are going to 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.240
 learn what the triplet is for 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.850
 which is what the triplet is for 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.260
 to basically where normally 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.540
 two notes enter three 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.170
 is the irregular figures is the most 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.009
 used 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.049
 then we have had for example 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.500
 a white one not inside a white one 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:25.130
 we usually entered we had said two 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.369
 black so each white equals 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.369
 two times and each black equals 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.830
 a good time ok now when one 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.830
 has three sons 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.780
 where they entered two now enter three 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.780
 okay 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.810
 and the symbol 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.110
 of the three stamps is this line is like 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.110
 a kind of clasp 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.160
 the bracket lying with a 3 ok that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.130
 it means that before they entered 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.920
 two blacks now enter three black three 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.920
 three children in black would actually be ok 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.860
 and the same for all minds more 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.520
 figures we have a white normally 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.980
 in a white enter only 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.470
 sorry a round and usually in a 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.440
 round only two white enter now if 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.370
 we need this 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.200
 that normally exactly 3 white 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.400
 inside that round 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400
 the same 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.940
 eighth notes and so we can follow all the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.810
 late but good let's do this 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.230
 example 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.110
 we have an eighth note two eighth notes three 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.660
 eighth notes to three chairs 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.370
 and enter three because they are triplets 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.690
 normally without the three and focus myself on 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.830
 just two ok and how does this sound we're going to 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.830
 put the two examples 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.930
 we have a black 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.610
 with two normal eighth notes and then another 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.610
 black 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.540
 33 them 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.200
 eighth note 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.900
 okay 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.739
 this would be the pulse would be this 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.019
 and the eighth notes ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:42.390
 in 222 eighths in each in each pulse 1 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.500
 2 1 2 2 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:53.099
 now here with the same for the same 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:57.709
 pulse 12 312 3 123 23 points 12 wave 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:00.569
 tata tata ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.370
 ok at the same time in the same 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.220
 space where normally between the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.400
 two we put three and the three are equal 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.000
 okay 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.489
 well that's it for now we'll see each other in 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200
 the next one always remember the three 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.980
 seals 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.940
 the brand is this 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:26.260
 ok and they can be triplets so much of what 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.830
 that is white three white equivalents 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.270
 to a round 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.620
 in the place where normally in the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.380
 where two white people would enter 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.360
 in three and we can do the same 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.700
 with three children of black 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.260
 and here it would be for a white 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.260
 good to him 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.190
 those very ordinary alarm clocks very 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.870
 cheap that plastic that are made 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.650
 in China 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.480
 the alarm is usually this 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.140
 the rhythm of the alarm 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.140
 have 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.960
 triplets 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.240
 and a black 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.370
 three other stamps remember that the 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.560
 eighth notes can be grouped as we have 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.260
 seen in the third class 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.290
 in the fourth class 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.490
 if they did not see it go right now to 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.530
 see her 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.500
 then the exporters that well 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.500
 ordinary people have the alarm that exists 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.500
 appetite 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.210
 trillo 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:43.040
 and the pulse triplet and pulse ok that's the 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.520
 best example that I can think of so that 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.640
 see how a good triplet sounds 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.000
 remember triplets three notes in the 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.300
 place where two of us normally enter 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.300
 we see the next
