00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
talking while I'm in the game playing

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
talking while I'm in the game playing
especially<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> newer<00:00:28.140> Maps<00:00:28.439> because<00:00:28.769> I'm

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
especially on the newer Maps because I'm

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.800 
especially on the newer Maps because I'm
trying<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.189> actually<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:30.179> where

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
trying to actually think about where

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.060 
trying to actually think about where
they're<00:00:30.990> heading<00:00:31.349> at<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> where<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:31.949> go

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
they're heading at and where they go

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.950 
they're heading at and where they go
Uncas<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.820> older<00:00:33.360> maps<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> pretty<00:00:33.899> much

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
Uncas the older maps you pretty much

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.380 
Uncas the older maps you pretty much
know<00:00:34.260> how<00:00:34.559> people<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.890> gonna<00:00:35.390> basically

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
know how people are gonna basically

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.860 
know how people are gonna basically
flock<00:00:36.809> around<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> map<00:00:38.600> I've<00:00:39.600> recently

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
flock around the map I've recently

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
flock around the map I've recently
changed<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:40.800> sensitivity<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> three<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
changed my sensitivity up to three and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
changed my sensitivity up to three and
it<00:00:43.739> seems<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> suits<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.640> style<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.969> little

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it seems like it suits my style a little

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.110 
it seems like it suits my style a little
better<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.190> what<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.309> guys<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
better and what do you guys think do you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
better and what do you guys think do you
the<00:00:49.079> next<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:49.440> games<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> three

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the next two games will be a three

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.119 
the next two games will be a three
sensitivity<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.719> first<00:00:51.989> game<00:00:52.710> will<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.039> at

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
sensitivity the first game will be at

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.410 
sensitivity the first game will be at
two<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> tell<00:00:56.550> me<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> play

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
two and tell me if I you think I play

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
two and tell me if I you think I play
better<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:57.930> sensitivity<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.770> three

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
better at two sensitivity or three

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
better at two sensitivity or three
sensitivity<00:00:59.930> okay<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.379> gonna<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:03.379> go

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
sensitivity okay so we're gonna go on go

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
sensitivity okay so we're gonna go on go
on<00:01:04.409> back<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:05.850> been<00:01:06.030> practicing<00:01:06.570> my

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
on back up I've been practicing my

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.830 
on back up I've been practicing my
dropping<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.770> drop<00:01:08.070> shotting

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
dropping my drop shotting

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.530 
dropping my drop shotting
which<00:01:09.890> basically<00:01:10.909> practice<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.270> prone

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
which basically practice to go in prone

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.429 
which basically practice to go in prone
when<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.080> trouble

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
when I'm in trouble

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
when I'm in trouble
instead<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.070> trying<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> fire<00:01:14.549> fight<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
instead of just trying to fire fight it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.230 
instead of just trying to fire fight it
out<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:16.020> seems<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.350> work<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.650> real<00:01:16.860> well<00:01:18.950> a

out and he seems to work out real well a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.730 
out and he seems to work out real well a
lot<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> them<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.659> lot<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> stuff<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.619> the

lot of them a lot of the stuff on the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.300 
lot of them a lot of the stuff on the
map<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:24.200> he's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.470> small<00:01:25.799> map<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> even

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
map here he's a very small map is even

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
map here he's a very small map is even
like<00:01:26.430> overgrown<00:01:27.110> over<00:01:28.110> crawls<00:01:28.320> small<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
like overgrown over crawls small to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.760 
like overgrown over crawls small to
Paris<00:01:29.070> someplace<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.579> lay<00:01:29.790> slam<00:01:30.680> get<00:01:31.680> my

standing out in the open and I try to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.050 
standing out in the open and I try to
run<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> train<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.850> them<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.000> there

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
run a train on them and see right there

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.240

strategies<00:01:55.619> nothing<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
strategies nothing like this I think I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.600 
strategies nothing like this I think I
played<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.939> map<00:01:57.090> maybe<00:01:57.710> six<00:01:58.710> times<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.399> Call

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
played the map maybe six times on Call

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.780 
played the map maybe six times on Call
of<00:01:59.640> Duty<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:01.009> now<00:02:02.009> people<00:02:02.340> find<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.610> hard<00:02:02.759> to
