00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
not what is is whether we strengthen and
strengthen<00:01:50.189> correctly<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.299> it's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
strengthen correctly and I think it's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.940 
strengthen correctly and I think it's
the<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.689> decision<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.530> rushing

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the right decision to not go rushing

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.590 
the right decision to not go rushing
