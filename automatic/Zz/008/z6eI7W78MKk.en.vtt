00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.969
 hello everyone from lancer good them 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.349
 I bring a trick in the carrier map and 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:11.570
 this time what we will do is get out 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.580
 out of this map and how will I think 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.230
 you will say where you know well then what 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.539
 what we have to do is go here 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.890
 You have come here far 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.710
 the planes leave to take off and 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.779
 there we see that you already see that I'm jumping 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.850
 getting some jumps and sure 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.109
 you want to know how they are made by how 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.419
 you see what we have to do is place 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.270
 a pack or two as you have seen there 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.190
 of base and that an ally has us one 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.780
 ok we know that the last one that falls us 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.309
 push then we have to be 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.530
 pushing the package we have that these 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.149
 five weird things the doll and our 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.680
 ally has to push our del 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.750
 it's worthwhile to push us by 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.899
 where I go better I recommend going to the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.460
 half there we just know that we have 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.940
 that placing the exception will not come out 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.230
 because it was that since it was not 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.510
 to die because the patch is very close 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.460
 we will see it here in first person 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.260
 see if I stay here a little thinking 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.820
 doing a good kinematics for the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.679
 video that I want to make of compilation 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.119
 of all the tricks and we see that what 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:09.050
 we have to do is wait for 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.150
 our ally 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.800
 a package for that has to be in 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.390
 our team and that is killing another 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.730
 from the other team we know that just 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.740
 the package falls and starts moving to the 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.420
 screen I see that I'm out and I go back to 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.950
 get in then our partner 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.690
 will have to push us from behind will have 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 to sprint and jump and then we see that 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 already when we see that we are already dating 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.510
 well we have already left and now what 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.280
 we can do is little if you put 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.160
 packages we can do little we can not 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.810
 do many things I can teach you that 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.130
 is what I recommend doing is go point or 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.630
 packages because the truth that we 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.040
 we can move in many ways just by 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.260
 here because if we leave a bit more 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.400
 palante we are going to fall and not to fall 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.810
 what we have to do is place 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.520
 packages you see that here is 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.780
 patched everything to the front and I say to see 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.100
 if it can jump there but not because it is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.020
 that there is a barrier and we see that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.020
 get there and then I fall 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.490
 there it is the barrier gets there like that 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.530
 that I do not think you can discover 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.810
 many things out here on the map and 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.810
 I was investigating but it is that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.760
 everything patched everything a pretty barrier 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.610
 large that is quite complicated from 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.370
 trespass and we can not go up here and 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.080
 then put packages to go towards 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.290
 go ahead that what we try to do 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.940
 challenge that is to reach the end and I have 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.530
 arrived almost I have not arrived at all 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.030
 because it is impossible to get to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.440
 the end because you run out of shovel more 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 that nothing not because you do not know how to jump 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.200
 because it is that the truth that gave me 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.360
 pretty 6-3 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.100
 on this road since it has cost 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.989
 it's pretty good there we go I'm 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.870
 killing first with the gun and 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.790
 final we will have to have the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.500
 sniper because is that if you go to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.880
 carry a normal weapon you will see it at 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.070
 character since we are in a 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.870
 far away but you're not going to 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.190
 see you are going to have to be like 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.930
 firing at the head because it's that 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.340
 it's so far away that you're not going to be able to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.080
 to arrive and what I'm going to try to do is that 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.910
 I'm going to do a tutorial on how 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.769
 get out of the maps making the package 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.769
 this one that pushes you to continue I do not know what 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.840
 title I'm going to put the video because 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.209
 put tutorial how to make the package 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.860
 that pushes you does not stay bad I think it's 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 I do not know another name to put 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.780
 ok but I think I'm going to do this 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.099
 tutorial I will do that yes because I know 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.810
 that a lot of people are telling me not to 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.640
 it comes out that I do not know that I do not know how much 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.230
 what to see is not done the first time 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.670
 will go to the first and you will see the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.170
 carrier because the carrier is there 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.940
 that trespass a pretty barrier 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.349
 big you have to try it many times 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.650
 until there is a time when 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.599
 we will be lucky and having released 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.579
 it comes out of the trick, it's not because I 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.200
 know a lot and precisely not because 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.630
 precisely the packages less to you to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.980
 another person and that person does not know much 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.290
 of tricks that are being incorporated 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 right now in the world of tricks 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.549
 ok and I told him to start throwing 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.349
 packages was to see if he is good and 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.120
 it seems that it is valid and that it has not 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.459
 taken care has never never done 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.079
 tricks of these and it has come out okay and 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.000
 why then why have we been 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.160
 Pretty trying is not worth it's nothing 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.720
 easy so if I can extract the 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.069
 tutorial on how to make at least 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.850
 packages fall more or less as they have 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.250
 that fall is worth why 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.680
 know a little bit of base and now I'm 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.880
 ending there it came did not reach much more 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.260
 it does not take until the end because I see that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.570
 there is the last package I am left 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.760
 has a paper airplane of those and not 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.200
 it came to the end I fall down like this 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.690
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.100

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.940
 black ops 2 so well then here the

 unsj greetings and see you next time
