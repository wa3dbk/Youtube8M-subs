to create a lot of waste product with

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.880 
to create a lot of waste product with
creatine<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> combat<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.350> best<00:01:40.590> time

creatine so to combat that the best time

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.520 
creatine so to combat that the best time
to<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.430> creatine<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.899> body<00:01:43.170> has

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to take creatine is when your body has

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.460 
to take creatine is when your body has
an<00:01:43.799> insulin<00:01:44.490> spike<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.140> blood

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
an insulin spike so when your blood

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.069 
an insulin spike so when your blood
sugar<00:01:46.530> levels<00:01:47.280> rise<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.479> body<00:01:48.780> secretes

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
sugar levels rise and your body secretes

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
sugar levels rise and your body secretes
insulin<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.549> combat<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> blood<00:01:51.390> sugar

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
insulin to combat that blood sugar

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
insulin to combat that blood sugar
because<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> insulin<00:01:52.920> does<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
because what that insulin does is it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.060 
because what that insulin does is it
drives<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.479> creatine<00:01:54.930> directly<00:01:55.799> into

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
drives that creatine directly into

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
drives that creatine directly into
muscle<00:01:56.460> cells<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.149> almost<00:01:57.479> doesn't<00:01:58.049> give<00:01:58.290> your

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
muscle cells it almost doesn't give your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.190 
muscle cells it almost doesn't give your
body<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> chance<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.520> create<00:02:00.450> too<00:02:00.719> much<00:02:00.930> waste

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
body a chance to create too much waste
product<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.340> stuff<00:02:02.640> around<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.180> that
