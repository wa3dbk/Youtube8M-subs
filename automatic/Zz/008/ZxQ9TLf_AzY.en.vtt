with the competition vs online compared

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
with the competition vs online compared
to<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.930> well<00:01:12.930> online<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:15.299> game<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> bit

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to here well online the game is a bit

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.460 
to here well online the game is a bit
faster<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.390> sometimes<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.810> opponents<00:01:19.140> got

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
faster and sometimes some opponents got

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.240 
faster and sometimes some opponents got
the<00:01:19.770> delay<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.960> therefore<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.619> lose

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the delay and therefore you could lose

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
the delay and therefore you could lose
two<00:01:23.610> uplands<00:01:24.500> online<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.909> offline

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
two uplands online but when it's offline

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
two uplands online but when it's offline
it's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.430> less<00:01:30.149> random<00:01:31.159> what<00:01:32.159> are

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it's a I think it's less random what are
