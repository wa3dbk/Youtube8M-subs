00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 I was about to break that point 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.840
 I was of what is said to change this 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.760
 I remembered 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.270
 One has a bearing born with poise and has 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.800
 born with a pretty graceful DNA 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.800
 for that sense 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.160
 that one puts on top does not have to 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.219
 condition has to help you in the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.890
 naturalness and above all let it be 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.050
 move and let there be that feels 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.420
 that cam and that falls that stumbles that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.090
 is to get up or lie down without 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 have to be thinking about the 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.570
 composure 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.880
 that they mount a vanity fee 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.140
 important not but not dependent on what 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.140
 that the mirror in mind 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.649
 the skirt for a man I think that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.450
 we are comfortable that there is of the world yes yes 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.159
 especially because it is aired a lot 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.490
 move very well 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.260
 do not stay you have to see from what 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 had each end 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.950
 and they put an uncomfortable shoe on me what 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.510
 puts an uncomfortable pants on a shirt 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.280
 awkward 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.870
 the tight that they do not let me breathe 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.150
 a jacket with which I can not 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.040
 move that is be it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.940
 everything that one puts on top has 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.940
 to be a second skin 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.210
 all the songs on this album 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.060
 cardio somehow have 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.170
 belong to a family tree that 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.750
 It has roots in the past 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.830
 very clearly and it is an exercise that I 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.560
 I have not set out to do but that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.140
 immediately you can notice the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.060
 which species is not that the group of 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.060
 songs belong 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.260
 I like how it has grown itself 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.670
 as it has also been spending time 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.670
 getting old I do not have the feeling if I 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.250
 I see in my face but since there is not no 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.070
 rictus neither of fatigue nor of pain because 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.900
 time has gone well and I think I've 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.140
 understood things well 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.230
 but if I love I love it 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:36.160
 have done everything I've done 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.810
 I like all the chapters very 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.810
 well sit down to listen to my whole career 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.140
 and with terror because I did not know what it is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.420
 how was everything and especially in 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.970
 that is today will be me once 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.920
 have listened to all that material the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.720
 truth is that I was very very very very 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.189
 I was very surprised because I saw 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.760
 perfectly that one thing leads to the 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:04.530
 another that there was a coherence 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.530
 and a very precise line 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.970
 thank you and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.970
 but after 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.510
 cool
