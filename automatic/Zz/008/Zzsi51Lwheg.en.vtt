 This mode can be found in the game. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.909
 of events 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 the purpose of this mode is to follow the route 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:57.449
 without missing a single checkpoint wins 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 the player who will show the most 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.830
 best time 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.220
 but of course you need to try not 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.680
 smash his plane but if 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.830
 evil will not happen this trouble you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 will be asked to continue the race 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.200
 paying the cost of repairing a particular 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 the plane and so on until here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.730
 run out of patience or game currency yes 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.770
 by the way 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.710
 what you see on screen 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.140
 this is an air race in realistic 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.090
 mode 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 I personally this mode in the race is very 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 Liked I think he visibly revived 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 the game 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.810
 made her a real drail when you 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.950
 flying the race route from 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.210
 checkpoint so checkpoint and you get 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.890
 a lot of emotion and adrenaline 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 pass the racing route without breaking 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.720
 very difficult even if you are not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.670
 father master aerobatics and you 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.220
 fly can not hold on 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.070
 crashing into any obstacle then 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.470
 obstacle in the form of your opponent 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.470
 catch up and hit you 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.079
 next with this if someone did not notice 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.870
 switched to a new format 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:23.519
 but rather acquired a new ball format 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.840
 monitor instead of the old square for 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.209
