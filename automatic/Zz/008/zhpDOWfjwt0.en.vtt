00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
one of the first steps in regards to

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.400 
one of the first steps in regards to
learning<00:00:04.820> Lightroom<00:00:05.270> is<00:00:05.540> becoming<00:00:06.080> familiar

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
learning Lightroom is becoming familiar

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.800 
learning Lightroom is becoming familiar
with<00:00:06.740> the<00:00:07.129> interface<00:00:07.580> so<00:00:08.270> let's<00:00:08.450> go<00:00:08.600> ahead<00:00:08.630> and

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:08.810 
with the interface so let's go ahead and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.510 
with the interface so let's go ahead and
take<00:00:09.050> a<00:00:09.110> look<00:00:09.410> one<00:00:10.130> of<00:00:10.220> the<00:00:10.250> things<00:00:10.310> you'll

have the Lightroom logo this is called

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.050 
have the Lightroom logo this is called
the<00:00:15.350> identity<00:00:15.920> plate<00:00:16.250> and<00:00:16.460> then<00:00:16.789> on<00:00:16.910> the

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
the identity plate and then on the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.670 
the identity plate and then on the
right-hand<00:00:17.330> side<00:00:17.720> we<00:00:17.870> have<00:00:18.200> what<00:00:18.500> is<00:00:18.530> called

right-hand side we have what is called

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.460 
right-hand side we have what is called
the<00:00:19.100> module<00:00:19.760> picker<00:00:20.030> and<00:00:20.300> here<00:00:20.900> we<00:00:21.020> can<00:00:21.170> select

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
the module picker and here we can select

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.380 
the module picker and here we can select
different<00:00:21.830> modules<00:00:22.700> and<00:00:22.970> these<00:00:23.120> are<00:00:23.270> the

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
different modules and these are the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.930 
different modules and these are the
modules<00:00:23.840> we've<00:00:24.140> already<00:00:24.380> talked<00:00:24.800> about<00:00:25.130> well

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
modules we've already talked about well

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.120 
modules we've already talked about well
currently<00:00:26.210> I'm<00:00:26.570> in<00:00:26.600> the<00:00:26.869> library<00:00:27.110> module<00:00:27.710> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
currently I'm in the library module and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.400 
currently I'm in the library module and
here<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:28.910> can<00:00:29.090> see<00:00:29.360> that<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:29.570> have<00:00:29.660> panels<00:00:30.199> on

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
here you can see that I have panels on

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.400 
here you can see that I have panels on
the<00:00:30.680> left<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.279> right<00:00:31.310> hand<00:00:31.970> side<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:32.660> one<00:00:33.350> of

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
the left and right hand side and one of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.569 
the left and right hand side and one of
the<00:00:33.500> things<00:00:33.620> that's<00:00:33.739> interesting<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.550> that

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
the things that's interesting is that

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.639 
the things that's interesting is that
we'll<00:00:34.940> see<00:00:35.210> panels<00:00:35.809> in<00:00:36.019> each<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
we'll see panels in each of the

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.160 
we'll see panels in each of the
different<00:00:36.800> modules<00:00:37.219> now<00:00:38.210> there'll<00:00:38.480> be<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.629> few

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
different modules now there'll be a few

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.439 
different modules now there'll be a few
similarities<00:00:39.710> but<00:00:40.219> for<00:00:40.429> the<00:00:40.519> most<00:00:40.789> part<00:00:41.030> each

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
similarities but for the most part each

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.500 
similarities but for the most part each
module<00:00:41.929> has<00:00:42.229> its<00:00:42.679> own<00:00:42.829> set<00:00:43.280> of<00:00:43.339> panels<00:00:43.879> for

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
module has its own set of panels for

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.090 
module has its own set of panels for
example<00:00:45.019> I'm<00:00:45.319> going<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.530> go<00:00:45.620> ahead<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.949> click

example I'm going to go ahead and click
on<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.460> develop<00:00:46.940> module<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.600> here<00:00:47.809> you're

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
on the develop module and here you're

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.479 
on the develop module and here you're
going<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.079> see<00:00:48.319> that<00:00:48.530> yes<00:00:48.769> I<00:00:48.979> do<00:00:49.100> have<00:00:49.399> a

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
going to see that yes I do have a

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.939 
going to see that yes I do have a
navigator<00:00:50.179> although<00:00:50.989> these<00:00:51.229> panels<00:00:51.800> down

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
navigator although these panels down

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.520 
navigator although these panels down
below<00:00:52.339> are<00:00:52.609> different<00:00:53.149> let<00:00:53.659> me<00:00:53.780> click<00:00:54.049> back<00:00:54.289> so

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
below are different let me click back so

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.410 
below are different let me click back so
that<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.769> can<00:00:54.979> see<00:00:55.249> the<00:00:55.399> comparison<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:56.359> the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
that you can see the comparison in the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.020 
that you can see the comparison in the
right<00:00:57.199> hand<00:00:57.469> side<00:00:57.559> it's<00:00:57.920> much<00:00:58.159> more<00:00:58.429> dramatic

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
right hand side it's much more dramatic

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.090 
right hand side it's much more dramatic
right<00:00:59.269> we<00:00:59.449> have<00:00:59.569> histogram<00:01:00.170> quick<00:01:00.589> develop

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
right we have histogram quick develop

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.189 
right we have histogram quick develop
and<00:01:01.280> then<00:01:01.909> in<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.239> develop<00:01:02.629> module<00:01:02.780> we<00:01:03.109> have

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
and then in the develop module we have

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.609 
and then in the develop module we have
histogram<00:01:03.739> than<00:01:04.040> basic<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.360> on<00:01:05.619> another

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
histogram than basic and so on another

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.870 
histogram than basic and so on another
thing<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:06.920> you're<00:01:07.130> going<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.340> notice<00:01:07.520> is

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
thing that you're going to notice is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880 
thing that you're going to notice is
that<00:01:07.939> in<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.600> two<00:01:08.780> different<00:01:09.049> modules<00:01:09.680> we

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
that in the two different modules we

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.789 
that in the two different modules we
have<00:01:10.070> a<00:01:10.100> toolbar<00:01:10.850> down<00:01:11.240> below<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:12.439> sits

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
have a toolbar down below this sits

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.069 
have a toolbar down below this sits
beneath<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.610> image<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.240> here<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:14.869> have<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
beneath the image and here we have a

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.749 
beneath the image and here we have a
number<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.560> different<00:01:15.680> options<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:16.729> can

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
number of different options we can

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.270 
number of different options we can
increase<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.420> rating<00:01:18.140> for<00:01:18.649> this<00:01:18.770> particular

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
increase the rating for this particular

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.060 
increase the rating for this particular
image<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:20.180> can<00:01:20.329> add<00:01:20.539> a<00:01:20.570> label<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.740> few<00:01:21.950> other

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
image we can add a label and a few other

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.819 
image we can add a label and a few other
things<00:01:22.159> as<00:01:22.609> well<00:01:22.780> now<00:01:23.780> when<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:24.020> go<00:01:24.049> back<00:01:24.439> to<00:01:24.500> the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
things as well now when I go back to the

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.349 
things as well now when I go back to the
library<00:01:25.130> module<00:01:25.640> you're<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.149> to<00:01:26.210> notice

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
library module you're going to notice

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.450 
library module you're going to notice
that<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:26.719> have<00:01:26.750> different<00:01:27.320> options<00:01:27.500> here<00:01:28.159> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
that I have different options here and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.190 
that I have different options here and
these<00:01:28.850> options<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.810> do<00:01:29.960> with<00:01:30.109> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
these options have to do with the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.080 
these options have to do with the
different<00:01:30.590> ways<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:31.039> can<00:01:31.219> view<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.609> images

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
different ways we can view the images

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.599 
different ways we can view the images
compare<00:01:32.929> them<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.770> few<00:01:33.979> other<00:01:34.130> things<00:01:34.189> as

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
compare them and a few other things as

particular size of your thumbnails is

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.650 
particular size of your thumbnails is
really<00:02:14.600> going<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.750> be<00:02:14.900> contingent

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
really going to be contingent

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
really going to be contingent
how<00:02:15.900> many<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.320> have<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.400> own

how many you have and your own

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.490 
how many you have and your own
preference<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:18.960> well<00:02:19.140> let's<00:02:19.290> take<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
preference all right well let's take a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.190 
preference all right well let's take a
look<00:02:19.620> at<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> couple<00:02:20.310> more<00:02:20.640> modules<00:02:21.210> next<00:02:22.050> we'll

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
look at a couple more modules next we'll

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.260 
look at a couple more modules next we'll
look<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> slideshow<00:02:23.220> module<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.880> again

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
look at the slideshow module and again

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.670 
look at the slideshow module and again
here<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.230> different

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
here you can see we have different

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.980 
here you can see we have different
options<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:26.430> each<00:02:26.730> side<00:02:27.030> regards<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> our

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
options on each side regards to our

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.670 
options on each side regards to our
panels<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.740> then<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.180> print<00:02:30.480> module

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
panels and then we have the print module

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.050 
panels and then we have the print module
which<00:02:31.680> gives<00:02:31.950> us<00:02:32.100> some<00:02:32.310> options<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.760> how<00:02:33.000> we

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
which gives us some options for how we

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.840 
which gives us some options for how we
can<00:02:33.300> print<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> photograph<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.410> finally<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
can print the photograph and finally the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.900 
can print the photograph and finally the
web<00:02:36.120> module<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.290> as<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:38.070> navigating

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
web module so as you can see navigating

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.460 
web module so as you can see navigating
between<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.450> different<00:02:39.810> modules<00:02:39.990> is

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
between the different modules is

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.100 
between the different modules is
actually<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.520> simple<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.720> other<00:02:42.870> thing

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
actually really simple the other thing

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.050 
actually really simple the other thing
that<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> illustrate<00:02:43.710> here<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.880> we

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
that I want to illustrate here is if we

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
that I want to illustrate here is if we
go<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.540> develop<00:02:46.020> module<00:02:46.280> you'll<00:02:47.280> notice

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
go to the develop module you'll notice

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.860 
go to the develop module you'll notice
that<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> number<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.750> different

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that we have a number of different

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.870 
that we have a number of different
panels<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.800> right<00:02:49.950> hand<00:02:50.190> side<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.760> have

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
panels on the right hand side that have

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.600 
panels on the right hand side that have
been<00:02:51.060> collapsed<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.710> open<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
been collapsed now to open one of the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.580 
been collapsed now to open one of the
panels<00:02:53.970> all<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.540> do<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.930> click<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.350> its

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590

that will open the panel you can of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.870 
that will open the panel you can of
course<00:03:00.390> close<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> same<00:03:01.560> way<00:03:01.830> if<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.730> have

course close it the same way if you have

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.540 
course close it the same way if you have
multiple<00:03:03.090> panels<00:03:03.600> open<00:03:04.140> at<00:03:04.290> once<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.370> use

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
multiple panels open at once you can use

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.520 
multiple panels open at once you can use
the<00:03:05.700> scroll<00:03:06.060> bar<00:03:06.240> on<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.540> right<00:03:06.570> hand<00:03:06.960> side<00:03:07.110> to

the scroll bar on the right hand side to
scroll<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.430> down<00:03:09.620> alright<00:03:10.620> well<00:03:10.800> now<00:03:10.950> that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
scroll up and down alright well now that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.890 
scroll up and down alright well now that
we<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.400> little<00:03:11.700> bit<00:03:11.940> about<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.390> interface

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
we know a little bit about the interface

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.600 
we know a little bit about the interface
let's<00:03:13.620> take<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> look<00:03:14.100> at<00:03:14.190> some<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
let's take a look at some of the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.180 
let's take a look at some of the
essential<00:03:14.910> interface<00:03:15.690> shortcuts<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.100> we

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
essential interface shortcuts so that we

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.220 
essential interface shortcuts so that we
can<00:03:17.370> navigate<00:03:17.640> throughout<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.570> interface<00:03:18.990> a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
can navigate throughout the interface a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.640 
can navigate throughout the interface a
little<00:03:19.620> bit<00:03:19.770> more<00:03:19.920> effectively
