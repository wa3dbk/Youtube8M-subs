securely<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.960> working<00:01:07.140> quickly<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.800> still

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
securely if I'm working quickly I still

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.400 
securely if I'm working quickly I still
have<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> hold<00:01:08.940> it<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.210> hand<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.140> feels<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
have to hold it by hand it just feels a

bit<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.590> secure<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.430> could<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.330> as

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
bit more secure I could do it just as

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.320 
bit more secure I could do it just as
well<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.990> ticking<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.160> but<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.090> feel
