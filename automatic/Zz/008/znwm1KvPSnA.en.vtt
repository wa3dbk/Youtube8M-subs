the Start menu
now<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.140> only<00:02:27.590> issue<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.570> when<00:02:30.530> you

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
now the only issue is that when you

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.660 
now the only issue is that when you
launch<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:32.000> game<00:02:32.300> from<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.050> start<00:02:33.380> menu<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.520> if

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
launch a game from the start menu so if

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.610 
launch a game from the start menu so if
I<00:02:34.760> would<00:02:34.910> launch<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.360> game<00:02:35.420> right<00:02:35.810> here<00:02:36.050> it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
I would launch this game right here it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.870 
I would launch this game right here it
launches<00:02:37.100> steam<00:02:37.370> tile<00:02:37.640> first<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.880> afterwards

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
launches steam tile first and afterwards

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.580 
launches steam tile first and afterwards
it<00:02:41.330> launches<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.410> actual<00:02:42.950> game<00:02:43.610> right<00:02:44.180> here

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
it launches the actual game right here

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.550 
it launches the actual game right here
so<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> only<00:02:47.020> problem<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.320> that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
so that's the only problem really that

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.920 
so that's the only problem really that
there<00:02:48.710> is<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.460> this<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> windows<00:02:50.360> related

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
there is but this is the windows related

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.500 
there is but this is the windows related
issue<00:02:51.140> windows<00:02:51.890> largest<00:02:52.400> detail<00:02:52.820> first<00:02:53.150> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
issue windows largest detail first and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.220 
issue windows largest detail first and
then<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.200> launches<00:02:54.650> your<00:02:54.920> game<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.930> not<00:02:57.080> that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230
