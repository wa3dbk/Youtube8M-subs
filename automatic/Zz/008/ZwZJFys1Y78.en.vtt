00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.760
 the altar opens into a vast choir but a happy one is not so deceitful 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.110
 extraordinary deception 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.140
 who I am a genius of the Renaissance could invent 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.880
 but we are not here only for the bramante but also to see others 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 wonders preserved in this way 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.059
 here it is the original happens

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.260
 for example a Greek cross plan on which acsi di are opened 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:19.639
 in short, according to a Byzantine style, links add 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.009
 that come from the distant weapons 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.550
 a place of great charm 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.579
 we are sure that even the bramante 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.540
 he was fascinated and therefore the restructuring without distorting it 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.359
 he was probably also influenced by some project sounds 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.899
