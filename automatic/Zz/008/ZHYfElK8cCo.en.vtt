00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.970
 hello very good today we are going to work 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:11.810
 multiples of 6 are worth going to work 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.670
 many multiples 3 4 5 6 and so on 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.840
 etcetera but today I'm going to put multiple 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.840
 of 6 because because it is 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.699
 this application comes in the wake of the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.539
 question that raised us the clear forgiveness 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.429
 lewy from argentina contacted 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.039
 us through the channel and we 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.039
 asked the following why 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
 7107 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.110
 but 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.579
 76 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.870
 OK 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:57.969
 because 2.076 well is multiple of 6 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.210
 because this yes and any 7107 is not 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.580
 worth multiple of 6 I think the question 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.020
 nothing is aimed at that if we add 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.810
 all the figures gives us vale 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.719
 a multiple of 3 if we add all the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.179
 good figures also gives us a multiple 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.050
 of 3 sometimes it is associated that if the 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.320
 figure 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.730
 multiple of 3 necessarily have to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.890
 be a multiple of 6 and that's a mistake worth 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:33.270
 what is the condition to know that a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.600
 number is multiple from 6 is worth 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.230
 I always see it with the rules of the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 divisibility agree if it is already multiple 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.230
 of ba is divisible also by b of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.940
 agreement then how can we know if 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.710
 a number is a multiple of a number 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.260
 also thanks to the rules of the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.320
 divisibility to know if a number is 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.040
 multiple of 6 that number 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.960
 it has to be divisible 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.070
 between 2 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.340
 and between 3 that easy and we're going to do 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 the proof 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 7107 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.970
 7107 is a number of divisions between 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:28.060
 three obviously because because the sum 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:33.520
 of the figures 71 + 0 plus 77 + 18 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.910
 08 7 of 15 15 if we divide it by 3 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.459
 gives us an exact division or is 15 a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 multiple of 3 agree then this 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.000
 part is verified but what is it that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.530
 happens that 7107 is not divisible by 2 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.250
 because it does not end in zero or figure 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.630
 par ended up in 7 you see it then as no 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.850
 this condition is met 7107 is not a 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.290
 multiple of 6 that easy 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.290
 let's go for the next 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.810
 36 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.709
 OK 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.120
 between 2 and between 3 we will verify what 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.330
 is division between 2 of course because 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.310
 because just 0 in this case figure even 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.660
 ends in number in figures in number forgiveness 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.269
 for just 6 is worth and let's see if 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:48.470
 this number is also divisible between 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:51.650
 32 marcelo plus 7 more 62 marcelo 2 796 15 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.310
 15 is a division number between 3 because 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.130
 the exact division or multiple of 3 what 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:04.750
 You see how it is verified both 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:11.170
 conditions 2.076 if it is multiple of 6 and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:14.410
 7 thousand 107 is not a multiple of 6 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.590
 the condition is worth careful avoid the 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.680
 mistakes a number because it is divisible 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.620
 a multiple of 3 does not have to be 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.040
 divisible or multiple of 6 well so that 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.600
 a number is a multiple of 6 has to 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.900
 be divisible at the same time between 2 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.090
 Okay, but swim and take care of Argentina 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.770
 that you have clarified the doubt if you continue 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.900
 having more questions or if you followed or 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.630
 new questions please contact me 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.720
 through the channel his taste the video by 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.820
 please like me and subscribe that we are going to 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.530
 put very interesting videos 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.530
 greetings see you later
