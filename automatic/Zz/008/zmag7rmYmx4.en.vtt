00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.229
 They lead you to more notes of the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.399
 nameless helper during the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.630
 gameplay you will not only

 For example, diary entries are 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.100
 still scattered in the game world 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.409
 most of the time you will be in the 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.880
 mountains wander around the difficult and 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.319
 unusual thing is that yours 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.829
 character not shown on the map 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.049

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.640
 on it are only places where notes 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.740

 travel points with the help of a compass 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.719
 and already found points you have to 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.719
 navigate the game world 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.020
 during our walks through the 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.360
 Russian mountains are not ours 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.159
 other people meet only colored 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.630
 shadowing these have us either 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.490
 helped or and are beyond 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.289
 promoted by her colorful colors 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.880
 Stinging tailor out of the ordinary 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.530
 because most of the time you will be in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.630
 bleak to spend the snow 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.459
 colat was in the anvil engine 4 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.730
 The title is also developed 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.050
 on 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.510
 snowfall and winter landscapes 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.709
 its rarely more beautiful from only 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.300
 The snowfall would have changed 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.590
 developers can still work 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.590
 that comes a little bit abrupt 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.570
 most of the time you will be in cholet 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.280
 through the mountains run the strict 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.850
 following the map or just into the blue 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.740
 in 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.480
 who in- depth gameplay or many 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.280
 We can not do that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.960
 On the other hand , we recommend an exciting one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.000
 looking for a story and intoxicating atmosphere 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.000
 he should take a closer look
