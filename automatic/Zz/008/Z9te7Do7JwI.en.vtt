so<00:00:05.580> explain<00:00:10.250> we're<00:00:11.250> gonna<00:00:11.340> measure<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.849> debt

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
so explain we're gonna measure the debt

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.849 
so explain we're gonna measure the debt
clearance<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.590> fixture<00:00:14.269> okay<00:00:15.859> all

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
clearance with this fixture okay all

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.640 
clearance with this fixture okay all
right<00:00:17.180> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> picture<00:00:18.690> we've<00:00:18.869> made<00:00:19.109> or

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
right this is a picture we've made or

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.470 
right this is a picture we've made or
major<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.250> deck<00:00:20.430> clearance<00:00:21.740> very<00:00:22.740> rigid

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.070 

completely<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> see<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> whole<00:00:31.050> thing

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
completely can you see the whole thing

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.299 
completely can you see the whole thing
okay

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
okay

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.330 
okay
which<00:00:33.030> represents<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> cylinder<00:00:34.110> head

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
which represents the cylinder head

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.770 
which represents the cylinder head
that's<00:00:35.340> why<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.820> four<00:00:36.090> holes<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that's why we have four holes in it so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.180 
that's why we have four holes in it so
we<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:36.899> torque<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.040> were<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
we can torque it and as if it were a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850 
we can torque it and as if it were a
real<00:00:38.399> head<00:00:39.200> now<00:00:40.200> we're<00:00:40.350> gonna<00:00:40.440> set<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
real head now we're gonna set it on a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.790 
real head now we're gonna set it on a
flat<00:00:40.890> plate<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.290> zero<00:00:43.559> clearance

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
flat plate so we have zero clearance

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
flat plate so we have zero clearance
between<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.460> tool<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.500> plate<00:00:48.200> we<00:00:49.200> expect

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
between the tool and the plate we expect

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
between the tool and the plate we expect
to<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:49.920> about<00:00:50.160> 40,000<00:00:51.030> deck<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> this

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to get about 40,000 deck out of this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
to get about 40,000 deck out of this
measurement<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.890> gonna<00:00:52.980> preload<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
measurement so we're gonna preload the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:05.340 
measurement so we're gonna preload the
dial<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.360> 50

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:14.860 

or<00:01:05.860> ease<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.460> measuring

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:26.359 

you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.980 

okay<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:27.430> if<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.790> rock<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.509> can<00:01:28.630> see<00:01:28.840> that

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
okay so if I rock this you can see that

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
okay so if I rock this you can see that
we've<00:01:29.110> got<00:01:29.909> 5<00:01:30.909> 10<00:01:31.570> 15<00:01:32.350> 20<00:01:33.210> 25<00:01:34.210> 30<00:01:34.570> 35<00:01:35.250> 40<00:01:36.600> 45<00:01:37.619> 50

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we've got 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990 
we've got 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.200> normal<00:01:41.530> amount<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.920> give<00:01:42.640> for

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and the normal amount of give for

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.520 
and the normal amount of give for
playing<00:01:43.360> any<00:01:43.780> equipment<00:01:46.259> we're<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.440> put

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
playing any equipment we're going to put

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:56.370 
playing any equipment we're going to put
it<00:01:47.590> on<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.770> head<00:01:47.979> or<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.759> block<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:56.200> we

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
it on the head or on the block if we

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.670 
it on the head or on the block if we
follow<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.710> down

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.890 

we<00:02:04.220> can<00:02:04.400> see<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.850> didn't<00:02:05.240> even<00:02:05.270> come<00:02:05.510> back<00:02:05.720> to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
we can see that didn't even come back to

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.340 
we can see that didn't even come back to
zero<00:02:06.200> yet<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:08.360> we'll<00:02:08.630> see<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.900> effects<00:02:09.200> of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
zero yet now we'll see the effects of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:20.730 
zero yet now we'll see the effects of
torque

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.740 

so<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> difference<00:02:22.060> between<00:02:22.180> this

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
so this is the difference between this

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.080 
so this is the difference between this
fixture<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.650> what<00:02:23.830> somebody<00:02:24.040> else<00:02:24.250> does<00:02:24.730> is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
fixture and what somebody else does is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.610 
fixture and what somebody else does is
that<00:02:25.270> you're<00:02:25.390> torquing<00:02:25.780> them<00:02:26.080> all<00:02:26.230> evenly

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
that you're torquing them all evenly

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.450 
that you're torquing them all evenly
mimicking<00:02:27.160> your<00:02:27.280> head<00:02:27.490> as<00:02:27.730> opposed<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:30.280> a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
mimicking your head as opposed to just a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.310 
mimicking your head as opposed to just a
bar<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.730> would<00:02:31.060> go<00:02:31.210> across<00:02:31.330> right<00:02:32.110> some

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
bar that would go across right some

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.370 
bar that would go across right some
people<00:02:32.590> use<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.740> bar<00:02:33.070> straight<00:02:33.460> across<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
people use a bar straight across the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.880 
people use a bar straight across the
deck<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.190> by<00:02:36.880> doing<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.740> you're<00:02:38.740> only

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
deck and by doing that you're only

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.650 
deck and by doing that you're only
squashing<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.580> portion<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> gasket<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
squashing a portion of the gasket and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.540 
squashing a portion of the gasket and
you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.900> actually<00:02:41.050> damage<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.530> gasket<00:02:41.800> or

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you can actually damage the gasket or

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.400 
you can actually damage the gasket or
break<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> barrel<00:02:43.240> sometimes<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.110> you're<00:02:44.290> not

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
break a barrel sometimes and you're not

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.560 
break a barrel sometimes and you're not
gonna<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:44.770> an<00:02:44.920> accurate<00:02:45.370> reading<00:02:45.910> right<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
gonna get an accurate reading right the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:56.370 
gonna get an accurate reading right the
reading<00:02:46.840> will<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:46.960> off<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:48.490> we<00:02:49.030> torque<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:56.260> we

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
reading will be off so we torque and we

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.990 
reading will be off so we torque and we
come<00:02:56.530> up<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.770> stages<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.430> we<00:02:57.640> don't<00:02:57.760> pull

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
come up in stages so that we don't pull

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.070 
come up in stages so that we don't pull
the<00:02:58.090> barrel<00:02:58.390> off<00:02:58.510> angle<00:03:00.780> bring<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.900> up<00:03:01.960> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
the barrel off angle bring it up to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.600 
the barrel off angle bring it up to
about<00:03:02.200> seven<00:03:02.620> pounds<00:03:02.830> first<00:03:03.280> time<00:03:03.610> -<00:03:05.280> yeah<00:03:06.280> we

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
about seven pounds first time - yeah we

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.430 
about seven pounds first time - yeah we
start<00:03:06.820> coming<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.150> further<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:08.290> heard

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
start coming up further and I heard

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.240 
start coming up further and I heard
about<00:03:08.650> 12<00:03:13.260> pattern<00:03:14.260> doesn't<00:03:14.530> matter<00:03:14.830> much<00:03:15.100> at

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
about 12 pattern doesn't matter much at

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.090 
about 12 pattern doesn't matter much at
this<00:03:15.400> point<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:17.380> we're<00:03:17.560> coming<00:03:17.800> up<00:03:17.920> in

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
this point because we're coming up in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.870 
this point because we're coming up in
steps<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:22.470> come<00:03:23.470> up<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.710> 18<00:03:24.070> pounds<00:03:24.310> up<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:24.790> we

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
steps I come up to 18 pounds up so we

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:35.309 
steps I come up to 18 pounds up so we
talked<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.210> Ed<00:03:25.360> to

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.869 

now<00:03:35.860> if<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.159> look<00:03:36.280> at<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.489> dial<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:39.430> started

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
now if you look at the dial it started

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.740 
now if you look at the dial it started
off<00:03:40.030> at<00:03:40.209> about<00:03:41.159> negative<00:03:42.159> 4<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:43.480> we're

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
off at about negative 4 now we're

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.309 
off at about negative 4 now we're
reading<00:03:44.700> over<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.939> other<00:03:46.060> side<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.450> 0<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.900> if<00:03:50.140> I

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
reading over the other side of 0 so if I

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:58.789 
reading over the other side of 0 so if I
roll<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> piston<00:03:51.069> up<00:03:51.220> if<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:52.420> had<00:03:52.659> dead<00:03:53.260> 0<00:03:53.680> dec

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.970 

okay<00:03:59.940> we're<00:04:00.940> bringing<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.329> piston<00:04:01.690> up<00:04:01.840> if<00:04:02.829> it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
okay we're bringing the piston up if it

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.770 
okay we're bringing the piston up if it
had<00:04:03.129> zero<00:04:03.159> dec<00:04:03.700> we<00:04:04.120> would<00:04:04.269> be<00:04:04.390> right<00:04:04.540> there

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
had zero dec we would be right there

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.899 
had zero dec we would be right there
right<00:04:05.500> on<00:04:05.620> 0<00:04:09.329> after<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.359> full<00:04:10.629> lap<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:12.579> we<00:04:12.700> have

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
right on 0 after a full lap but we have

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.780 
right on 0 after a full lap but we have
not<00:04:13.090> even<00:04:13.269> achieved<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.989> full<00:04:14.200> lap<00:04:14.409> here<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.609> we

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
not even achieved a full lap here so we

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.039 
not even achieved a full lap here so we
know<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.060> count<00:04:16.539> backwards<00:04:17.549> 5<00:04:18.549> 10<00:04:18.970> 15<00:04:19.570> 20<00:04:20.019> 25

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
know to count backwards 5 10 15 20 25

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.450 
know to count backwards 5 10 15 20 25
and<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.340> go<00:04:21.459> on<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.639> other<00:04:21.669> side<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:22.150> 25<00:04:22.560> 30<00:04:23.560> 35

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
and you go on the other side of 25 30 35

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.110 
and you go on the other side of 25 30 35
40<00:04:24.840> 45<00:04:26.100> 47<00:04:27.100> thousands<00:04:29.400> I've<00:04:30.400> had<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.820> fixture

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
40 45 47 thousands I've had this fixture

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.550 
40 45 47 thousands I've had this fixture
on<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:31.570> off<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.780> hear<00:04:31.930> three<00:04:32.139> or<00:04:32.199> four<00:04:32.380> times

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
on and off you hear three or four times

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.800 
on and off you hear three or four times
already<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.789> has<00:04:33.940> repeated<00:04:34.449> within<00:04:34.660> a

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
already and it has repeated within a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.230 
already and it has repeated within a
half<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.110> thousand<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.979> is<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.789> guarantee

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
half a thousand so that is a guarantee

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.570 
half a thousand so that is a guarantee
of<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.570> good<00:04:37.690> accurate<00:04:38.410> piece<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.800> equipment<00:04:39.490> to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
of a good accurate piece of equipment to

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.540 
of a good accurate piece of equipment to
measure<00:04:39.729> something<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:42.099> engine<00:04:42.280> has

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
measure something so this engine has

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.550 
measure something so this engine has
47,000<00:04:43.539> dec<00:04:43.750> perfect<00:04:45.300> we've<00:04:46.300> got<00:04:46.510> 40,000<00:04:47.349> for

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
47,000 dec perfect we've got 40,000 for

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.600 
47,000 dec perfect we've got 40,000 for
the<00:04:47.710> actual<00:04:48.039> growth<00:04:48.599> of<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.810> rod<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.050> piston

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
the actual growth of the rod and piston

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.460 
the actual growth of the rod and piston
and<00:04:51.610> we've<00:04:51.820> got<00:04:51.970> 7<00:04:52.330> thousandths<00:04:52.840> for<00:04:53.139> carbon

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
and we've got 7 thousandths for carbon

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.630 
and we've got 7 thousandths for carbon
build<00:04:53.680> up<00:04:54.180> should<00:04:55.180> be<00:04:55.270> good<00:04:55.449> deal
