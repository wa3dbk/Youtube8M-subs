00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.270 

my<00:02:43.090> workbench<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.110> about<00:02:44.260> complete<00:02:44.440> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
my workbench is just about complete and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.960 
my workbench is just about complete and
I<00:02:45.400> have<00:02:45.640> these<00:02:45.940> four<00:02:46.299> pieces<00:02:46.569> left<00:02:46.810> over<00:02:47.970> they

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
I have these four pieces left over they

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.780 
I have these four pieces left over they
were<00:02:49.030> from<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.420> legs<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:51.430> I'm<00:02:51.549> going<00:02:51.670> to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
were from the legs and what I'm going to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.319 
were from the legs and what I'm going to
do<00:02:51.909> with<00:02:52.030> those<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:53.370> make<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> small<00:02:54.670> clamping

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
do with those is make a small clamping

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:29.199 
do with those is make a small clamping
system<00:02:55.540> for<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.260> tabletop

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.240 

so<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.079> really<00:03:30.560> like<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.890> way<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.189> thing

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
so I really like the way this thing

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.039 
so I really like the way this thing
turned<00:03:31.730> out<00:03:31.909> it's<00:03:34.000> it's<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.150> nice<00:03:35.329> solid<00:03:35.599> bench

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
turned out it's it's a nice solid bench

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:44.649 
turned out it's it's a nice solid bench
with<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:37.269> clean<00:03:39.099> smooth<00:03:40.099> top<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:43.879> is<00:03:44.030> also<00:03:44.269> easy

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
with a clean smooth top it is also easy

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.539 
with a clean smooth top it is also easy
to<00:03:44.840> hook<00:03:45.140> different<00:03:45.620> kind<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:45.920> clamps<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.430> it

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
to hook different kind of clamps to it

00:03:46.549 --> 00:04:24.750 
to hook different kind of clamps to it
as<00:03:47.349> well<00:03:48.349> as<00:03:48.500> my<00:03:48.680> clamping<00:03:49.189> system

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.280 

so<00:04:25.760> I'm<00:04:25.880> sure<00:04:26.120> I'll<00:04:26.270> find<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.600> lot<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.810> uses<00:04:27.260> for

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
so I'm sure I'll find a lot of uses for

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.940 
so I'm sure I'll find a lot of uses for
