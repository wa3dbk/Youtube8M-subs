00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.630
 for our hearty paprika soup 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.870
 I need a paprika first 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 solve first and then fine 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.320
 Strip and cut the dice 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.500
 how big is not so important there is that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.750
 to parry anyway 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.810
 The whole thing is synonymous with a onion g 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.580
 I cut fine dice and then 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.490
 needs a fairly large pot he gives 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.759
 Heat some oil to the whole and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.969
 then go first on the onions and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.390
 then I add the paprika 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.520
 I used to read the whole thing first 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.040
 whole short for two to three minutes 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.230
 stew and damage in time 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.969
 a medium-sized potatoes and here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 I make it just as easy in fine 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 cut the dice and then for a few 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.559
 minutes with in the pot then give that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 Stir again whole and now 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.439
 I add the vegetable woman here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.520
 just pour on and in the next 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.729
 first step for a few minutes 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.850
 let it boil and stir again 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.290
 After about 15 minutes we can do that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.290
 whole puree 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.390
 and then we can do it around the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.440
 fine tuning I give that something 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.160
 cayenne pepper and salt and to 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.420
 tie and souvenir some more cream 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.340
 stir for a few minutes 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.570
 leave to simmer and pull through 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.470
 let and you have a wonderful 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.210
 delicious paprika soup I wish you 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.400
 to have a good appetite and still have 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.740
 a nice rest sunday comes right 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.750
 Now for the curry soup if you have something else 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.890
 to grill you will find on the left 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.270
 beautiful things on the side 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.560
 and if it has not already done so 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.910
 everywhere but I would be happy and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.180
