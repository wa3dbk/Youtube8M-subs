flying to lower your house you can

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060 
flying to lower your house you can
report<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.479> not<00:01:51.810> any<00:01:52.020> UAV<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.009> be

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
report it and not any UAV that will be

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
report it and not any UAV that will be
operating<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.490> Africa<00:01:53.820> commercially<00:01:54.360> will

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
operating so Africa commercially will

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
operating so Africa commercially will
have<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> registration<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
have a registration and will have a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.149 
have a registration and will have a
registration<00:01:57.030> plate<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> UAV<00:01:58.290> itself<00:01:58.680> way

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
registration plate on the UAV itself way

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
registration plate on the UAV itself way
by<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.640> identified<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.540> let

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
by it will be identified and let

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.690 
by it will be identified and let
registration<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> car<00:02:02.399> number

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
registration is just like a car number

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.399 
registration is just like a car number
plate<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> gets<00:02:03.390> tracked<00:02:03.930> back<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
plate and it gets tracked back to the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.760 
plate and it gets tracked back to the
official<00:02:05.159> operate<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.790> owner<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.689> UAV<00:02:07.079> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
official operate and owner of the UAV so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
official operate and owner of the UAV so
there's<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.220> no<00:02:08.520> hiding<00:02:09.000> from<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
there's really no hiding from this

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.930 
there's really no hiding from this
really<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.590> no<00:02:10.739> hiding<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.819> best

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
really there is no hiding and the best

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220 
really there is no hiding and the best
thing<00:02:12.060> about<00:02:12.180> these<00:02:12.450> things<00:02:12.510> most<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.080> them

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
thing about these things most of them

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.700 
thing about these things most of them
have<00:02:13.440> to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
have to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.450 
have to
is<00:02:13.860> tracking<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.340> him<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.180> very<00:02:15.330> easy<00:02:15.600> to

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
is tracking on him so it's very easy to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.070 
is tracking on him so it's very easy to
notify<00:02:17.460> somebody<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.390> able<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.630> put<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
notify somebody and be able to put on a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.110 
notify somebody and be able to put on a
GPS<00:02:19.440> tracker<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.100> see<00:02:20.460> where<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.940> ears

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
GPS tracker and see where you have ears
are<00:02:21.270> burning<00:02:21.480> within<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.960> specific<00:02:22.110> area<00:02:22.620> once

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
are burning within a specific area once

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.210 
are burning within a specific area once
that<00:02:23.310> UV<00:02:24.030> has<00:02:24.270> landed<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.960> safe<00:02:25.710> instances

that UV has landed and safe instances

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.100 
that UV has landed and safe instances
civil<00:02:26.550> aviation<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:27.360> arrives<00:02:27.840> at<00:02:28.080> a

civil aviation then arrives at a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.350 
civil aviation then arrives at a
specific<00:02:28.410> location<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.790> access<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
specific location they can access the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.240

and<00:02:32.490> they<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.090> retrieve<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.540> data<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.470> it's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
and they can retrieve the data so it's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.080

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
think some of our laws a little bit more

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.950 
think some of our laws a little bit more
relaxed<00:03:16.850> some<00:03:17.850> countries<00:03:18.270> don't<00:03:18.420> even<00:03:18.720> allow

that's<00:03:23.430> beyond<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:24.030> kilometer<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.140> it's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that's beyond a kilometer so it's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.840 
that's beyond a kilometer so it's
basically<00:03:25.410> out<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.680> your<00:03:25.920> view<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.310> that

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370

countries don't even offer that and so

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.520
