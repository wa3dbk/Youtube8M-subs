started<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:21.240> want<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.449> start<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
started we want to start out with the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.400 
started we want to start out with the
base<00:00:22.109> these<00:00:22.439> two<00:00:22.710> pieces<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
base these two pieces right here and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.009 
base these two pieces right here and
build<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.970> real<00:00:27.180> gold<00:00:27.510> nugget

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
build up in the real gold nugget

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380 
build up in the real gold nugget
it<00:00:28.980> would<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.519> these<00:00:29.730> two<00:00:29.910> pieces<00:00:30.090> right

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it would just be these two pieces right

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.889 
it would just be these two pieces right

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
levitate so you have to improvise you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.630 
levitate so you have to improvise you
want<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> start<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.210> by<00:00:39.210> attaching<00:00:39.540> these<00:00:40.640> two

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
use the slope be pieces in different

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.260 
use the slope be pieces in different
places<00:01:56.229> like<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:57.460> replace<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.000> by<00:01:58.060> a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
places like you can replace this by a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.140 
places like you can replace this by a
with<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> two<00:01:59.140> by<00:01:59.290> two<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.800> put<00:02:00.400> these<00:02:00.610> also

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
with a two by two and put these also

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.040 
with a two by two and put these also
right<00:02:01.510> there<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:04.510> that's<00:02:04.660> just<00:02:04.780> about<00:02:04.960> it
