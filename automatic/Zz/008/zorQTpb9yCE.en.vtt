00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.590
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 android tech today we are going to analyze the 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.450
 application to save battery 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.090
 battery guru the official application of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.950
 snapdragon of qualcomm 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.840
 what is the brand that most of 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.840
 the android processors 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.420
 as you see the first thing that there is 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.080
 highlighting is that it only works with 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.080
 qualcomm snapdragon processors 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.670
 as you can see here it puts the battery saving 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 which is not currently providing 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.630
 does not exist means 50% because it is at 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.730
 half or just an estimate I do not know what 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.790
 what is the total or anything does not put it 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.680
 here tips remaining battery life 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.480
 according to what we are doing now 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.590
 same 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.160
 and here a video about a dragon 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.420
 advertising of qualcomm snapdragon 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 here as you can see 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.430
 I'm from we can set all 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.610
 applications that we have installed 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.350
 the rate of update to which they are going 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.500
 be updated 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 as you can see here when you want it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.860
 it would be as always as if I had 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.270
 very installed the application 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.060
 when you open it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.090
 that's why it does not leave them current mixer if a 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.429
 the applications only when the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.520
 we open so they do not spend so 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.460
 spend very little on battery 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.550
 and here it is very interesting according to how 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.760
 the current one and cesc since the application d 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.090
 is seeing how to use the phone and 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.210
 applications in your day to day 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.479
 and those updated according to what already 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 stop what you think and according to your employer 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.810
 of use 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.820
 to this it is necessary to emphasize that when according to 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.190
 you install it the first two days 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.800
 use only to 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.670
 control what you do to set yourself 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.540
 herself and the first two days no no 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.540
 does nothing simply 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.650
 configure what you spend 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.510
 here battery level 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.099
 has been loading during the 5 23 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.099
 hours in the last 24 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.670
 As you can see here we have a small 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.270
 drop-down 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.910
 and we see the battery level during the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.370
 last 24 hours 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.420
 the wifi activity is disabled 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.420
 because the deactivated 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.100
 we can change it from here 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.150
 manage wifi as it comes by 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.640
 activated defect 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.849
 and he goes activating and deactivating wifi 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.849
 according 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 according understands what is most appropriate 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.590
 for according to him to save battery but I 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.720
 he deactivated it because 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.990
 when it was off it was connected 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.540
 sometimes to wifi 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.569
 without being able to control it 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.000
 here we have the low energy mode 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.280
 when it reaches 15 to us 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.860
 we want 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.440
 is activated and accept these things that 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.050
 we have here 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.910
 which we want as per 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.490
 example disable wifi and reduce the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.830
 brightness 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.740
 turn off bluetooth and things by the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.350
 style 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.830
 here that we put an icon in the bar 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.710
 of notifications 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.930
 and here share data animates mind here 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.310
 Also show the battery level if 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.310
 we activate the icon 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.440
 and here load reminders 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.870
 here has advanced some options on 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.870
 the wifi 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.270
 and this we have already seen 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.040
 and here as we see that it puts that battery and 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.289
 Uruguay reduced 52% of the time 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.259
 they are allowed updates to 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:31.310
 applications synchronize in the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.310
 last 24 hours 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.640
 as you see here, another one is activated here in 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.520
 low consumption mode that has not been 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.820
 activated any time in the last 24 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.390
 hours 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.740
 as you see here we come to the last 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.740
 column of the four that has 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.750
 apart from the adjustments as you see here 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.260
 we have promotional videos and here this 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.460
 It is very interesting 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.460
 a curiosity 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.289
 that that remove from detecting the processor 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.979
 what do you have to install that has the 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.050
 phone this the snapdragon s4 but in 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.600
 this case 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.780
 here puts some of the features 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.630
 and here we can go see the cpu's 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.360
 features that it has 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.980
 multimedia what it is capable of recording of 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.580
 play 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.230
 the display the camera that can 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.230
 have up to 20 megapixels 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.200
 here the afp s 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.860
 the connectivity that this 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.860
 processor 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.650
 gpu and all these as you see a 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.000
 information that if you want it is very 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.000
 easy to find it here 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.370
 we go here to widgets as you see has a 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:02.289
 own widget this application then what 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.729
 we will see 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:08.580
 tutorial here gives us a tutorial 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.710
 on 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.349
 now for example here is the next 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.289
 wifi learns where are your 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:18.000
 wifi zones and activates it when you're 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.629
 within coverage that's what 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.629
 deactivate and I 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.990
 as you see news version 2.2 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.900
 and this would be the application we are going to 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.900
 see the wiki 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:51.910
 here we have one mobile data for 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.910
 activate and deactivate 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.050
 and here is the other widget the big 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.280
 that we can activate the wifi 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.780
 in this case it will be to activate the 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.780
 wifi settings 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.550
 of the application itself so that what 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.110
 active activities when she creates 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.229
 timely 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.139
 here brightness automatic synchronization 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:32.629
 the data again and these follow the 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:36.090
 widgets this would be the application 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:39.270
 attribute and if you liked the video so 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:42.060
 loyal like subscribe to the share channel 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:46.729
 the video with everyone who has a 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.729
 android and see you in the next video
