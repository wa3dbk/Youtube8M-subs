 Hello everyone in this video I want to tell 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.580
 how to make a bootable mapquest flash drive 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.700
 they are 7010 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.040
 for installation on bye. will do of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.769
 under windows what do you need for this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 remove which we will put on 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 flash drive 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.410
 in my case I will put the image of the site 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 zone hackintosh collector not only 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 feature of this image of him 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.670
 integrating driver installation and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.789
 loaders such as chameleon and clavier 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.980
 and there is also support for the ppm kernel. 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.510
 also it has fixed a lot of things out there 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.280
 but in general a good build that we are looking for 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 for this we need we need 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 still program trans mag reference to this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.700

 also if you want to watch those videos 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.149
 the installation is easier to rest the summit scene but 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.500
 because there will be an annotation to the video 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.660
 go through it and see the installation 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.110
 macos scene summit on pc you can 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.369
 start creating our flash drive 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 start we also need the right 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.610
 paragon there so walk the right way drive 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.340
 devote we connect our flash drive and immediately 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.619
 go to the options of this program 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 configuration 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.810
 here we need to ask what we put

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.090
 opposite 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 be spoiled inside it we separate 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.650
 100 megabytes 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.570
 under the bootloader if you donâ€™t put it here 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 tick then the whole flash drive will go under 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.150
 the loader and the 100 meters itself is quite 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.600
 enough and click ok now click format 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.090
 drive and agree to our flash drive under 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.549
 bootloader installation starts but so 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.619
 the bootloader is now installed

 program we are interested in our flash drive here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.450
 As you can see, it is already part of this flash drive. 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.640
 separated under the carpet and there is already signed 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.369

 program trans magician and we need to open 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.910
 now downloaded our file from the system 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.860
 which we will put on the flash drive 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.420

 go to our flash drive 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.870
 there is before we load the program on behalf of

 go be the menu choose our flash drive and 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.570
 boot from it as you see 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.419
 our 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.360
 the bootloader has loaded so now 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.020
 let's start the installation 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.430
 systems 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.960
 but before that I set one parameter 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:31.979
 boot options this is a minus in 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:36.199
 and the schedule and was not native with this is due to 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:41.370
 the fact that my graphics are supported by apple and 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:44.009
 Download our installer is active 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.710
 the window of installation of the rest scene appeared 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:51.990
 summit our boot drive works 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.130
 it means everything is fine and finally I want 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.979
 tell you how 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.419
 to install this system I her 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.900
 I will not bet because I already have 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.940
 worth it I did the first thing that you need 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.699
 make it go into the utility 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.020
 We go utility and we are interested in disk 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:14.270
 utility and select the section that we 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.630
 singled out for poppy example and format 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.530
 go to the car and grow and choose 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.980
 maquas extended format and click once after 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.760
 why close this window and click continue 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.510
 We agree to the cantina 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.980
 and here in this window we select the necessary 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.530
 drive us and press continue 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:37.100
 and then begin installing mapquest n 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:39.650
 your because after he 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.870
 will install and when you boot the computer with 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.440
 using the bootloader on a flash drive run 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.500
 this system and there you will already understand 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.450
 put loader cupcakes and so on but 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.250
 This system is not built-in cupcakes and 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.980
 bootloader so no problem a 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.960
 I think, and in general, if this video is for you 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.670
 I like it if you like 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.170
 have any questions ask in 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.170
 comments thanks for attention
