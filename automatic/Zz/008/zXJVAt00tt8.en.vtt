very<00:03:30.610> well<00:03:31.170> at<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> beginning<00:03:32.710> and<00:03:32.890> now<00:03:33.040> I'm

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
very well at the beginning and now I'm

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.790 
very well at the beginning and now I'm
starting<00:03:33.790> more<00:03:34.450> where<00:03:35.050> we're<00:03:35.230> going<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
starting more where we're going and

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.510 
starting more where we're going and
which<00:03:36.190> kind<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.550> piece<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.910> becoming<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:39.340> is

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
which kind of piece is becoming so it is

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.240 
which kind of piece is becoming so it is
an<00:03:39.700> interesting<00:03:40.240> phase<00:03:40.870> right<00:03:41.110> now<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:41.740> when

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
an interesting phase right now it's when

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.970 
an interesting phase right now it's when
we<00:03:42.370> start<00:03:42.640> actually<00:03:42.820> thinking<00:03:43.780> twice<00:03:44.050> of<00:03:44.410> what

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
we start actually thinking twice of what

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.760 
we start actually thinking twice of what
