00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
stamps so I'm just gonna mount them onto

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.049 
stamps so I'm just gonna mount them onto
something

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
something

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.330 
something
this<00:00:45.390> happens<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.230> piece<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.770> plexiglass

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
this happens to be a piece of plexiglass

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.090 
this happens to be a piece of plexiglass
the<00:00:48.210> first<00:00:48.510> time<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> ink<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.860> rubber

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the first time that I ink up a rubber

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610 
the first time that I ink up a rubber
stamp<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.449> brand<00:00:51.809> new<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.230> hasn't

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
stamp because it's brand new it hasn't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
stamp because it's brand new it hasn't
been<00:00:52.739> seasoned<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.430> used<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
been seasoned or used at all I have to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
been seasoned or used at all I have to
put<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.500> effort<00:00:55.649> into<00:00:56.010> inking<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
put a little more effort into inking it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.150 
put a little more effort into inking it
up<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.780> tell<00:00:58.140> I've<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> enough<00:00:58.739> ink<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
up and I can tell I've got enough ink on

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.029 
up and I can tell I've got enough ink on
it<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.820> looks<00:01:00.120> completely<00:01:01.050> dark<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it because it looks completely dark and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.549 
it because it looks completely dark and
covered<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.940> areas<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.840> hard<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
covered in areas it's hard to see on

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
covered in areas it's hard to see on
camera<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.790> easier<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.330> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
camera but it's much easier to see in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 
camera but it's much easier to see in
person<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.049> you've<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> new<00:01:07.560> stamp<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
person so if you've got a new stamp you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
person so if you've got a new stamp you
may<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> ink<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> little<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
may have to ink it a little bit more the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.469 
may have to ink it a little bit more the
first<00:01:10.409> time<00:01:10.740> after<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:11.760> time<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.270> don't

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
first time after the first time I don't

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.410 
first time after the first time I don't
have<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> ink<00:01:12.930> nearly<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
have to ink nearly as much on this

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
have to ink nearly as much on this
because<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> pattern<00:01:15.930> wasn't<00:01:16.229> too<00:01:16.680> busy<00:01:17.040> with

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
because the pattern wasn't too busy with

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
because the pattern wasn't too busy with
this<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:18.960> lighter

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this and it's a little bit lighter

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.160 
this and it's a little bit lighter
colors<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.640> stamping<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.689> easy<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
colors the stamping is really easy and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
colors the stamping is really easy and
clear<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.729> you've<00:01:23.909> got<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
clear on this one so you've got a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
clear on this one so you've got a
stamped<00:01:24.600> image<00:01:24.689> right<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.290> top<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> jelly

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
stamped image right on top of the jelly

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
stamped image right on top of the jelly
print<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> details<00:01:27.750> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
print and you can see all the details in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
print and you can see all the details in
the<00:01:27.990> stamping<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.189> always<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.700> case

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the stamping that's not always the case

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
picked for this one we'll see if it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
picked for this one we'll see if it
shows<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.950> much<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.610> such<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
shows up as much because it's such a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.780 
shows up as much because it's such a
busy<00:01:51.180> print<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.619> answer<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.070> no<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.610> does

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
busy print and the answer is no it does

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
busy print and the answer is no it does
not<00:01:53.970> show<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.600> much<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.409> one

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
not show up as much that was just one

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.760 
not show up as much that was just one
very<00:01:56.159> busy<00:01:56.700> print<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.540> stamp<00:01:57.960> well

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
very busy print for that stamp well

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
very busy print for that stamp well
let's<00:01:58.979> try<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> print<00:01:59.790> that's<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.270> nearly<00:02:00.719> as

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
let's try a print that's not nearly as

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
let's try a print that's not nearly as
busy<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.799> actually<00:02:02.130> from<00:02:02.219> cleaning

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
busy so this was actually from cleaning

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
busy so this was actually from cleaning
off<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:02.939> brayer<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.540> when<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> stamp<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.799> that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
off my brayer and when I stamp on that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
off my brayer and when I stamp on that
you'll<00:02:05.850> see<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> much<00:02:06.990> clearer

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
you'll see that it's a much clearer

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.130 
you'll see that it's a much clearer
impression<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.700> image<00:02:09.060> now<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.869> depends

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
impression of the image now it depends

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.510 
impression of the image now it depends
what<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> one

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
what you want to do with it that one

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.820 
what you want to do with it that one
that<00:02:11.730> was<00:02:11.849> very<00:02:12.030> busy<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.510> hard

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
that was very busy and hard

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.150 
that was very busy and hard
see<00:02:13.100> that's<00:02:13.700> still<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.240> very<00:02:14.380> useful<00:02:15.380> stamped

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
that makes it a very interesting

painterly paint happening in there and
if<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.760> tried<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.150> plan<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.660> yeah<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.440> just<00:03:42.590> I

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
if I tried to plan that yeah I just I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.440 
if I tried to plan that yeah I just I
would<00:03:43.280> have<00:03:43.370> hurt<00:03:43.519> my<00:03:43.640> head<00:03:43.880> trying<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.239> play

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
would have hurt my head trying to play

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.240 
would have hurt my head trying to play
on<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.600> but<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> randomness<00:03:45.800> of<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.010> jelly

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
on that but the randomness of the jelly

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.280 
on that but the randomness of the jelly
plate<00:03:46.580> gives<00:03:47.209> me<00:03:47.360> something<00:03:47.660> wonderful<00:03:48.230> and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
plate gives me something wonderful and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.930 
plate gives me something wonderful and
interesting<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:48.890> I've<00:03:48.980> got<00:03:49.190> these<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.730> can

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
interesting so I've got these that I can

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.300 
interesting so I've got these that I can
now<00:03:50.120> work<00:03:50.450> with<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:50.900> an<00:03:51.019> art<00:03:51.200> journal<00:03:51.310> well

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
now work with in an art journal well

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.130 
now work with in an art journal well
those<00:03:52.550> were<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> easy<00:03:53.030> cuts<00:03:53.480> now<00:03:53.810> I'm<00:03:53.989> gonna

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
those were the easy cuts now I'm gonna

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.530 
those were the easy cuts now I'm gonna
do<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.350> fussy<00:03:54.950> cut<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.489> I'm<00:03:55.910> gonna<00:03:56.060> start<00:03:56.420> out

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
do a fussy cut and I'm gonna start out

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.810 
do a fussy cut and I'm gonna start out
by<00:03:56.600> sort<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.050> cutting<00:03:57.530> around<00:03:58.070> her<00:03:58.430> getting

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
by sort of cutting around her getting

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.150 
by sort of cutting around her getting
rid<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.330> bulk<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.019> paper<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.860> course

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
rid of the bulk of the paper of course

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.350 
rid of the bulk of the paper of course
I'll<00:04:01.340> save<00:04:01.519> that<00:04:01.550> use<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.180> something

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
I'll save that use that in something

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.420 
I'll save that use that in something
else<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:03.170> just<00:04:03.530> just<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:03.920> it's<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.100> little<00:04:04.310> more

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
else but just just so it's a little more

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.340 
else but just just so it's a little more
manageable<00:04:04.700> as<00:04:05.209> I'm<00:04:05.360> doing<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.019> can

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
manageable as I'm doing this so I can

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.140 
manageable as I'm doing this so I can
cut<00:04:06.590> where<00:04:06.800> I'm<00:04:06.890> actually<00:04:07.100> trying<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.700> cut<00:04:07.880> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
cut where I'm actually trying to cut and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.330 
cut where I'm actually trying to cut and
then<00:04:08.810> I'm<00:04:08.930> just<00:04:09.019> gonna<00:04:09.140> work<00:04:09.470> my<00:04:09.739> way<00:04:09.950> around<00:04:10.070> I

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
then I'm just gonna work my way around I

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.460 
then I'm just gonna work my way around I
do<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.519> lot<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.940> turning<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.510> paper<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.200> not

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
do a lot of turning the paper and not

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.259 
do a lot of turning the paper and not
the<00:04:12.709> scissors<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.310> get<00:04:13.519> around<00:04:13.880> in<00:04:14.120> the

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
the scissors to get around in the

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.110 
the scissors to get around in the
crevices<00:04:15.070> one<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.250> things<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:16.940> may

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
crevices one of the things that you may

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.880 
crevices one of the things that you may
not<00:04:17.269> be<00:04:17.330> able<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.660> see<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:18.229> part<00:04:18.530> because<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
not be able to see in part because the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.349 
not be able to see in part because the
camera<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.370> I've<00:04:19.430> got<00:04:19.640> this<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:20.000> high-speed

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
camera and I've got this on high-speed

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.420 
camera and I've got this on high-speed
here<00:04:20.959> because<00:04:21.560> it's<00:04:21.770> really<00:04:21.979> painful<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
here because it's really painful to

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.210 
here because it's really painful to
watch<00:04:22.550> somebody<00:04:22.760> cut<00:04:23.030> slowly<00:04:23.270> um<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.919> I'm

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
watch somebody cut slowly um is that I'm

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
watch somebody cut slowly um is that I'm
cutting<00:04:25.550> off<00:04:25.669> some<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.880> the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
cutting off some of the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.260 
cutting off some of the
so<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.539> is<00:04:26.720> really<00:04:27.139> not<00:04:27.380> precision<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.940> is

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
so this is really not precision this is

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.300 
so this is really not precision this is
about<00:04:29.720> getting<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.380> general<00:04:30.740> shape<00:04:30.979> of<00:04:31.160> it

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
about getting the general shape of it

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.430 
about getting the general shape of it
sometimes<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.389> little<00:04:32.599> dots<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.229> are

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
sometimes the little dots that are

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.879 
sometimes the little dots that are
around<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.910> hair<00:04:35.150> parts<00:04:35.599> those<00:04:36.410> got<00:04:36.650> cut

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
around the the hair parts those got cut

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.189 
around the the hair parts those got cut
