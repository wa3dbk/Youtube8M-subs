00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.320
 Vettel in Montreal - now a variant for everyone and that also means 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.650
 five centuries after the fact, even if from Croatia 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129
 U.S. dollar 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.810
 As with the big brother, only four drivers will be animated on the sixth tour day 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.159
 have one out 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.899
 these were the place and they try different animals before 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.799
 an approaching storm is of course an exciting one for children 

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.479
 History and they like to join in and hold theirs with us that too 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.360
 create 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 unlike x-men, there is no one can play cards 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.680
 always an extract must and actions best to understand that the little ones 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.989
 Not 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.850
 Fini hard to see through instead there is simply no general power 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.850
 pile up and when you do that you cover a card 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.860
 AUD and the lay and then according to the rule also just come off 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.630
 that's a lot easier. Kids were just as much fun 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.570
 the maps show that here are different animals 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.520
 and the basic rules first of all that in every stable was every animal 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.480
 who may occur only once 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.480
 I knew Katja Grassmann arbitrarily 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.150
 but now again, I have twice the same animal and the rule twice 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.470
 says that this money is not in the twin-engine since you can get each other 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 for example textiles 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 where there are also maps that show 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.600
 several animals 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 I have to make sure that at least one percent of their on the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.370
 Card not yet in the stable of Lester Coke was here we have already 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.140
 we already have the buck here 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.090
 the hare and Limburg but the parents is still in no way therefore can 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.520
 I put the ec card down completely you can see that's a big one 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.870
 Search game alone already that is not around 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.609
 Protect a pleasure and earn points 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.000
 even if they will help me a little bit are still in the game 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.300
 it is always a great challenge for children to watch which ones 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.999
 parts 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.389
 Can I because I had ever investor play together Assmann 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.100
 which goals have been ironed out 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.560
 and of course you have to be a bit lacking here to exclude us 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.520
 MFG that I only one animal what you 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.530
 does not have to be present and that Dr is of course there for children alone 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.120
 really exciting and educationally valuable day really 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.220
 to learn a lot and then cheers for developing that does not necessarily break 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.539
 very easy 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.079
 Nevertheless, there are limits so you can also score points 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.049
 namely the total of six different animals out in a row 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:26.609
 then 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.559
 you can pick up directly and make points look 1 2 the two but 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.400
 already 3 4 2 6 they now have six different animals i can handle it 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.679
 just take this whole series 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.329
 then as points for the final evaluation put aside then the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.849
 Mechanism bridge turned over it is not about preventing points 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.230
 because it is after amos' points but the whole thing became kinder for children 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.029
 designed it is about 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.129
 to save the animals and then came together he understood better and so 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.649
 Can you collect the points is just a kid with a 58 counter 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.259
 flawless in the variant can of course also like to turn around and 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.519
 that you try 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.599
 around the points 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.609
 as much as possible SN's strategy does not change much there 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.939
 There is no mechanism how to do big flop instead 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.219
 that she will of course uncover everything Eagle's 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.699
 and to clarify which games where it does not happen much less one 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.699
 Role plays as in sex with 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.199
 so that we simply continue playing so long is the state more than 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.729
 it is the last card is put on or the pure dissolved and then me 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.029
 I'm just good he has most of the animals here you can of course together 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.849
 have demanded that also count Alpina water Cologne you can 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.169
 Of course, just take the curb and of the same 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.059
 the profit position does not end the series so Metternicher we also know 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.729
 here to make the points accessible to children he wants to be faithful and 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.779
 Of course Aigner had the most animals or Günther plays that course 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.989
 yes, revenge seems to be sexy sensual younger than pure game 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.879
 and after Euro sitting should you have to exist 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.840
 that I'm the whole senses because actually rowing could now that 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.709
 they completely spare or drugs first game is set at the bottom it goes 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.290
 again in order to decide tactically in which cards to insert 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.979
 us 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.389
 so that would 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.949
 now ending picture postcards and who can not know and clean 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.719
 Instead, he is very petty after a relatively lucky run 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.780
 on the fact that he does not cause tension and is that both 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.690
 The parties only then you can just very specifically rub rubbing them down 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.879
 you can talk or not so a game even that they are a big one 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.879
 Number but must remember that it will play for the kids 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.789
 the whole even intensely after Molière I myself carry set leadership 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.610
 by 16 percent 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.030
 harmless but that does not change for the first time but which lead out that 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.250
 the children are easy to understand then this school has that 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.599
 looking for what in Ogden bakery chain causes Linde follow it very good 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.430
 Training for the kids and that's fun then the whole life as well 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.850
 As you progress, it is so important to have a strategic game 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.430
 Motto silicates interpreted so that they do not immediately rank a player 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.280
 and then I got the chance to attend the lets 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.210
 b it is about Montpellier HB Moser BfB the whole thing runs in principle of 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.090
 Semiconductor area knows "around arms 4 Ryan had at the same time it is about one 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.209
 Crash with vigorous Group VIG in July Textile thanked itself calls and 

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:27.779
 I'll be quick 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.319
 So the series so it was at the same time for the feeling I had 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.749
 even then, if that's why I do not want to just infect the hi-virus 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:39.080
 let's assume that our relationships are Neanderthals though 

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:43.339
 also that we flatly cited our noses for the simple flight no longer whole 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.419
 have a whole lot of fun the whole enjoy now child-friendly implemented 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.999
 could build up from 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:52.960
 For the first time the animals occur with the Grafenberger personnel positions 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.349
 the game has been agreed that is exactly in this claim that is 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.759
 Friends are looking without obligation means you have a bit of the 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.429
 Rain stopped turning to positive that you put the cards Ulrich 

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:09.349
 Wagner really has to think of everything that I myself whole 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.649
 excellent implementation of the water set that other countries do not 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:16.649
 just thinking that it really is worth it 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.409
 Two marble also silently directed in further laws
