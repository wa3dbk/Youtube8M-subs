00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
 Chapter 5 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.650
 but certain man called ananias with zafira his wife sold an inheritance and 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 subtract from the price knowing also his wife 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.619
 and bringing only a part he put it at the feet of the apostles 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.070
 and said pedro 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.099
 ananias because you do not satan your heart to lie is to 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.200
 Holy Spirit 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.819
 and their costumes is the price of the inheritance 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:24.999
 retaining it 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.839
 it did not stay for you 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.489
 identity was not in your power 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.890
 because you put your heart 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 you have not lied to men and not to god 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.400
 when hearing ananÃ­as these words fell down and expired 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.090
 and great fear came over all those who did it 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.409
 and rising young 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.409
 they wrapped him and taking him out they buried him 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 after a lapse of about three hours it happened that his wife came in 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.900
 not knowing what had happened 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.420
 then pedro told him 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.790
 you sold as long as the inheritance 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.100
 and she said 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.810
 while 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.170
 and Pedro told him 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 because with Denis they tell you to tempt the spirit of the Lord 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.360
 here is the door at the feet of those who have buried your husband and you 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.940
 they will take you out 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.250
 instantly she fell at his feet and expired 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.880
 and when they came in the young people thought of her dead 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.120
 and they took her out and buried her with her husband 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.020
 and I have great fear about the whole church and about all who heard these things 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.100
 and by the hand of the apostles and did many signs and wonders in 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.050
 the village 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.100
 and they were all with one accord in the porch of Solomon 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.460
 none of the others dared to join them 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.790
 but the people praised them greatly 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.550
 and those who believed in the Lord increased more large numbers thus 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.110
 men as women 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.890
 so much that they took the sick to the streets and put them on beds and beds 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.409
 so that when passing Pedro 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.750
 haro - his shadow fell on some of them 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.329
 and even from the city since sinas many came to jerusalem 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.329
 bringing sick and tormented of unclean spirits 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.289
 and everyone was healed 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.329
 then rising the high priest and all who were with him this is 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.519
 the sect of the Sadducees were filled with jealousy they laid hands on the apostles and 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.849
 they put them in public jail 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.670
 plus an angel of the Lord opening the prison doors at night and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.159
 taking them out said 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.400
 and I gave standing in the temple announced to the people all the words 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.009
 of this life 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.939
 having heard this they entered the temple tomorrow and taught 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.629
 Meanwhile 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.580
 came the high priest and those who were with him 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.150
 and they called the council and all the elders of the children of Israel 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.899
 and sent to jail for them to be brought 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.950
 but when the deputies arrived 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.929
 they did not find them in jail 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.939
 then they came back and gave notice saying 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.729
 certainly the jail we have found closed with all security 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.599
 and the guards standing outside the doors 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.169
 more when we open 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.379
 alari we have inside 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.209
 when these words arrive the high priest and the head of the guard of the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.870
 temple 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.999
 and the main priests 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.109
 I doubted what would happen to me 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.829
 but coming one gave them this news 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.779
 behold, the men you put in jail are in the temple and teach 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.109
 to town 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.170
 then he was the head of the guard with the deputies 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.890
 and brought them without violence 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.289
 because they feared being stoned by the people 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.460
 when they brought them 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.490
 they were presented at the council and the high priest asked them saying 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.489
 we strictly send ourselves that he does not teach six in that name 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.239
 and now filling Jerusalem with your doctrine and you want to throw 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.459
 we the blood of that man 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.329
 answering Peter and the apostles said 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.329
 it is necessary to see is goodbye before men 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.019
 that the god of our fathers raised Jesus 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.379
 There are some of you who killed him hanging on a tree 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.310
 to this 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.819
 God has exalted with his right hand for prince and savior 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.819
 to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.510
 and we are his witnesses of these things 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.100
 and also the holy spirit which has given god to those who obey him 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.459
 when they heard this they got angry and wanted to kill them 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.140
 Then a Pharisee named Gamaliel rose up in the council 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.090
 doctor of the revered law of all the people command that they get out by the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.520
 moment to the apostles 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.879
 and then he said 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.540
 Israeli men 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.610
 look for you, what it is to do about these men 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.749
 because before these days it was raised that weddings saying it was someone 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:47.370
 to this one joined a number about 400 men but I'm dead 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.219
 and all who obeyed him were scattered and reduced to nothing 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.790
 after this one rose judas in galileo 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.320
 in the days of the census 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.669
 and I've been following a lot of people 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.569
 He also perished and all those who obeyed him were scattered 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.379
 and now I tell you 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.889
 separated from these men and leave them 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.340
 because if this advice or this work belongs to men 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.710
 it will fade 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.289
 more if it's from god 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.080
 you can not destroy it 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.080
 do not be maybe found fighting against God 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.389
 and they lived with him 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.120
 she commanded the apostles after flogging the 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.260
 they were told not to speak in the name of Jesus 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.999
 and they were released 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.509
 and they left the presence of the council two bears having been held 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.509
 for worthy to suffer affront for the sake of the name 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.290
 and every day in the temple and by the houses 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.480
 they did not stop teaching and will preach that
