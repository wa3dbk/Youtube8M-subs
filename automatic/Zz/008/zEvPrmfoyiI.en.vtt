00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
out today I'm going to start by applying
one<00:00:31.260> coat<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.679> eye<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.759> how

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
one coat on one eye so we will see how

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.299 
one coat on one eye so we will see how
it<00:00:33.030> looks<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.950> wand

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it looks like so this is what the wand

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.950 
it looks like so this is what the wand
looks<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.820> there's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.570> bit<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
looks like there's a little bit of a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590 
looks like there's a little bit of a
curve<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.370> plastic<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.570> will

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
curve and it's a plastic one so we will

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.819 
curve and it's a plastic one so we will
see<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> applies<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.620> lashes

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.049 

by<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.039> I've<00:00:47.160> naturally<00:00:47.609> really<00:00:47.820> long

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
by the way I've naturally really long

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.669 
by the way I've naturally really long
lashes<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.019> really<00:00:49.410> really

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
lashes they're just really really

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:55.279 
lashes they're just really really
straight<00:00:50.219> which<00:00:50.899> sucks<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.899> curling

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
straight which sucks but if it's curling

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.579 
straight which sucks but if it's curling
it<00:00:55.739> should<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.250> good<00:00:56.809> okay<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:58.350> what

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
it should be good okay so that's what

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.740 
it should be good okay so that's what
one<00:00:58.979> coat<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.519> feel<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.909> my<00:01:00.030> lashes<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.510> going

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
one coat I feel like my lashes are going

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
one coat I feel like my lashes are going
in<00:01:00.870> crazy<00:01:01.320> direction<00:01:01.799> but<00:01:01.979> it<00:01:02.070> does<00:01:02.280> seem<00:01:02.519> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
in crazy direction but it does seem to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
in crazy direction but it does seem to
want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.089> curl<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.449> lashes<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.170> gonna<00:01:04.320> try

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
want to curl my lashes so I'm gonna try

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.270 
want to curl my lashes so I'm gonna try
to<00:01:04.619> apply<00:01:04.830> coat

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to apply coat

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.859 
to apply coat
they<00:01:05.549> decided<00:01:05.880> hopefully<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.330> lashes<00:01:06.539> her

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
they decided hopefully my lashes her

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.950 
they decided hopefully my lashes her
hurts<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.799> crazy<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:11.420> like<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
hurts so crazy I like that it's not a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
hurts so crazy I like that it's not a
super<00:01:13.530> wet<00:01:13.740> formula<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> feels<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.670> it's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
super wet formula it feels like it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.680 
super wet formula it feels like it's
freshly<00:01:15.149> open<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.899> it's<00:01:16.020> almost<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.680> sticky

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
freshly open but it's almost like sticky

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.529 
freshly open but it's almost like sticky
so<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:18.990> Adair's<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.649> my<00:01:19.800> lashes<00:01:20.539> so

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
so it really Adair's to my lashes so

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.090 
so it really Adair's to my lashes so
this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.929> one<00:01:22.110> coat<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.950> with

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
this is one coat as you can see with

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.430 
this is one coat as you can see with
this<00:01:23.250> eyes<00:01:23.460> went<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.179> crazy<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
this eyes went a little crazy but it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.740 
this eyes went a little crazy but it
seems<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.100> give<00:01:26.250> me<00:01:26.429> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
seems to give me a little bit more of a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.930 
seems to give me a little bit more of a
curl<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.289> I<00:01:28.500> appreciate<00:01:29.100> does<00:01:29.610> gave<00:01:29.789> me<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
curl which I appreciate does gave me a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.789 
curl which I appreciate does gave me a
little<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.179> of<00:01:30.299> light<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:30.720> volume<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.409> we'll

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
little bit of light and volume so we'll

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.050 
little bit of light and volume so we'll
see<00:01:31.979> how<00:01:32.220> two<00:01:32.700> coats

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
clean that up a little bit because I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.410 
clean that up a little bit because I
have<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.850> mascara<00:02:21.000> but

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
otherwise it seems really quite great so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.330 
otherwise it seems really quite great so
last<00:02:26.519> little<00:02:26.850> clothes<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.069> what<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
last little clothes so this is what it

looks really good

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.039 
looks really good
depends<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.239> obviously<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:33.959> you

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
depends what you like obviously if you

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.720 
depends what you like obviously if you
like<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.380> natural<00:02:34.680> looking<00:02:35.160> lashes<00:02:35.340> it's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
like even though there's a little bit of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.410 
like even though there's a little bit of
clumpiness<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.109> probably<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:41.420> still

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
clumpiness as you can probably see still

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.930 
clumpiness as you can probably see still
