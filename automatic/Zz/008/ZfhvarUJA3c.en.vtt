okay no we're I think about it well the
bacon<00:02:22.660> flavor<00:02:22.870> does<00:02:23.050> stand<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.610> that's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
bacon flavor does stand out that's

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:32.430 
bacon flavor does stand out that's
something<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:32.170> putting<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
something I do like that's putting the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.220 
something I do like that's putting the
bacon<00:02:32.800> flavor<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.520> top<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.110> worth

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
bacon flavor on top of it is it worth

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.780 
bacon flavor on top of it is it worth
the<00:02:35.350> extra<00:02:35.440> $4<00:02:38.160> hmm<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:40.570> very<00:02:40.630> hard<00:02:41.050> I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the extra $4 hmm that's very hard I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.150 
the extra $4 hmm that's very hard I
think<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:42.910> one<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.180> price<00:02:43.450> at<00:02:43.630> $10<00:02:44.160> adding

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
think it's one more price at $10 adding

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.340 
think it's one more price at $10 adding
two<00:02:45.280> dollars<00:02:45.580> but<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.030> mean<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.020> don't<00:02:47.080> know<00:02:47.230> what

their cost is to make it and they're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.340 
their cost is to make it and they're
really<00:02:50.200> overcharging<00:02:51.010> us<00:02:51.070> or<00:02:51.250> now<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:53.140> twelve
