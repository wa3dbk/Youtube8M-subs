00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.560
 There is no waste 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.100
 Relatively 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.390
 Since the key to use either an escape t has been very intensive 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.780
 It is immediately to the defense 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.080

 Relatively classy 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.370

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:58.820
 This is not the end anymore 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:04.210
 I can not obtain it, but I was interested in it a little personally 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.210
 It is more interesting if you can tell the feeling of use and much 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:11.639

 Even if you don't recognize it, it's too green 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:36.160

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.870

 A tomb keyboard with a wind a 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.170

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.520
 It might be a problem, so I think I'll check it for a moment 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.940
 It is quite interesting but it is a keyboard 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.240
 Then there are many other things like this 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.440
