didn't<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> problem<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> suit<00:01:00.719> design

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.719 
didn't have a problem of the suit design
I<00:01:01.289> thought<00:01:01.770> when<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> first<00:01:02.640> saw<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> film<00:01:04.729> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I thought when I first saw the film to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
I thought when I first saw the film to
me<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.090> iconic<00:01:06.510> design<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.260> because<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
me was an iconic design just because it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
me was an iconic design just because it
was<00:01:07.860> an<00:01:07.920> event<00:01:08.420> when<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> first<00:01:09.689> saw<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> film

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
was an event when I first saw the film

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.210 
was an event when I first saw the film
because<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.260> had<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.530> clue<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> King<00:01:11.189> Kong

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because I had no clue that King Kong

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.039 
because I had no clue that King Kong
Godzilla<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:12.330> met<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.720> fought<00:01:12.930> each

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
Godzilla actually met and fought each

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
Godzilla actually met and fought each
other<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.500> film<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> design<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> this

it's got a very thin very thin frame to
it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

it
the<00:01:45.780> Kong<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.439> had<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> potbelly<00:01:47.360> this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the Kong and I have had a potbelly this

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
the Kong and I have had a potbelly this
is<00:01:48.509> 62<00:01:49.110> Kong<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.130> more<00:01:50.280> chubby

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
is 62 Kong was a little bit more chubby

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.969 
is 62 Kong was a little bit more chubby
or<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.880> belly<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.990> trimmed<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> down

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
or in the belly but they trimmed it down

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
or in the belly but they trimmed it down
for<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> toy<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.820> don't<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.060> why<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.750> guess

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
for the toy I don't know why but I guess

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.810 
for the toy I don't know why but I guess
I<00:01:55.590> figured<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> look<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.159> imposing<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
I figured I look more imposing if you a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.560 
I figured I look more imposing if you a
little<00:01:57.060> trim<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.960> belly<00:01:58.259> right<00:01:58.770> there<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
little trim on the belly right there so

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.249 
little trim on the belly right there so
so<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> s62<00:02:01.619> Kong<00:02:02.780> I'm<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.960> compare

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so that's the s62 Kong I'm gonna compare

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
from Peter Jackson's film which I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.949 
from Peter Jackson's film which I
believe<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.670> film<00:02:24.060> should<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.569> released<00:02:24.840> in

believe that film should be released in
93<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:26.060> think<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.180> should<00:02:27.330> have<00:02:27.480> been<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
93 I think that should have been the

a Kong film from Jackson in 2005 was a

very solid nice special effects but it

very solid nice special effects but it
was<00:02:46.350> ultimately<00:02:46.739> underwhelming<00:02:47.750> because<00:02:48.750> of

its period of the time in which it was
made<00:02:50.989> which<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> shame<00:02:52.350> because<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
made which is a shame because it was a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.750 
made which is a shame because it was a
very<00:02:53.100> good<00:02:53.280> film

just<00:04:45.180> like<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.810> don't<00:04:46.530> know<00:04:46.710> what<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:46.919> was

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
just like that I don't know what it was

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.879 
just like that I don't know what it was
but<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.669> ended<00:04:48.660> up<00:04:48.750> with<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:48.960> con<00:04:49.380> figure<00:04:49.710> with

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
but I ended up with a con figure with

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.510 
but I ended up with a con figure with
that<00:04:50.040> with<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.360> major<00:04:51.360> disability<00:04:52.229> he<00:04:53.190> stands

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
that with a major disability he stands

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.360 
that with a major disability he stands
okay<00:04:53.850> which<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.150> good<00:04:54.800> but<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:56.070> looks<00:04:56.280> very

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
okay which is good but it looks very

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.340 
okay which is good but it looks very
weird<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.030> for<00:04:57.270> me<00:04:57.360> it's<00:04:57.510> kind<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.780> ruined<00:04:58.200> my

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
weird and for me it's kind of ruined my

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.560 
weird and for me it's kind of ruined my
enjoyment<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:58.979> figure<00:04:59.280> not<00:04:59.850> by<00:05:00.060> much

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
enjoyment of this figure not by much

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.600 
enjoyment of this figure not by much
but<00:05:00.720> it's<00:05:00.990> I<00:05:01.260> just<00:05:01.680> wish<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.070> had<00:05:02.370> looked

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
but it's I just wish that I had looked

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.480 
but it's I just wish that I had looked
before<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.570> purchased<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:06.530> but<00:05:07.530> it's<00:05:07.919> not<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.220> big

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
before I purchased it but it's not a big

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.129 
before I purchased it but it's not a big
drawback<00:05:09.229> it's<00:05:10.229> still<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.500> very<00:05:10.710> good<00:05:10.830> calm<00:05:11.280> toy

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
drawback it's still a very good calm toy

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.310 
drawback it's still a very good calm toy
as<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.350> see<00:05:13.530> him<00:05:13.620> side<00:05:13.860> by<00:05:14.040> side<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:15.260> know<00:05:16.260> you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
as you see him side by side you know you

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.659 
as you see him side by side you know you
could<00:05:16.680> see<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:16.979> could<00:05:17.070> kind<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.340> see<00:05:17.520> the

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
could see you could kind of see the

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.050 
could see you could kind of see the
deficiencies<00:05:18.210> in<00:05:18.360> super<00:05:18.900> riotous<00:05:19.200> calm<00:05:20.060> yeah

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
deficiencies in super riotous calm yeah

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.180 
deficiencies in super riotous calm yeah
if<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.539> had<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:22.530> same<00:05:22.800> look<00:05:23.070> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
if you had that that same look you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.490 
if you had that that same look you
probably<00:05:23.370> would<00:05:23.580> have<00:05:23.610> had<00:05:23.700> a<00:05:23.789> much<00:05:23.970> more

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
probably would have had a much more

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.550 
probably would have had a much more
legendary<00:05:25.500> King<00:05:26.370> Kong<00:05:26.610> Godzilla<00:05:27.150> film<00:05:30.560> but

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
legendary King Kong Godzilla film but

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.960 
legendary King Kong Godzilla film but
you<00:05:31.590> can<00:05:31.770> see<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:31.979> Kong<00:05:32.250> is<00:05:32.400> thinner<00:05:32.700> than

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
you can see this Kong is thinner than

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.400 
you can see this Kong is thinner than
this<00:05:33.270> Kong<00:05:34.280> but<00:05:35.280> he<00:05:35.340> has<00:05:36.050> far<00:05:37.050> more<00:05:37.080> imposing

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
this Kong but he has far more imposing

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.620 
this Kong but he has far more imposing
biceps<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.900> works<00:05:40.050> in<00:05:40.140> his<00:05:40.229> favor

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.029 

this<00:05:43.050> Kong<00:05:43.260> is<00:05:43.410> made<00:05:43.530> out<00:05:43.620> of<00:05:43.740> heavier

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
this Kong is made out of heavier

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.000 
this Kong is made out of heavier
material<00:05:45.000> this<00:05:45.419> is<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.780> vinyl<00:05:46.350> car<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:46.889> it's

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
material this is the vinyl car but it's

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.060 
material this is the vinyl car but it's
hollow<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:48.570> it's<00:05:48.750> very<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:49.620> know<00:05:49.650> if<00:05:49.830> we

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
hollow so it's very you know if we

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.650 
hollow so it's very you know if we
dropped<00:05:50.520> at<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.729> certain<00:05:51.090> height<00:05:51.210> or<00:05:51.510> if<00:05:51.600> you

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
dropped at a certain height or if you

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.060 
dropped at a certain height or if you
drop<00:05:51.900> it<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:52.080> certain<00:05:52.289> way<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.620> will<00:05:52.650> break

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
drop it a certain way it will break

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.460 
drop it a certain way it will break
unfortunately<00:05:54.080> whereas<00:05:55.080> this<00:05:55.169> one<00:05:55.380> is

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
unfortunately whereas this one is

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.990 
unfortunately whereas this one is
heavier<00:05:55.770> so<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:57.630> has<00:05:57.720> more<00:05:57.960> durability<00:05:58.260> I

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
heavier so it has more durability I

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.219 
heavier so it has more durability I
don't<00:06:00.000> know<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.120> later<00:06:00.300> Bandai<00:06:00.660> figures<00:06:01.020> have

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
don't know the later Bandai figures have

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.650 
don't know the later Bandai figures have
more<00:06:01.500> heavier<00:06:01.919> vinyl<00:06:02.400> but<00:06:02.970> this<00:06:03.180> one<00:06:03.389> did<00:06:03.630> not

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
more heavier vinyl but this one did not

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.620 
more heavier vinyl but this one did not
unfortunately<00:06:04.110> so<00:06:04.650> it's<00:06:04.770> it<00:06:05.700> can<00:06:05.970> be<00:06:06.090> prone<00:06:06.389> to

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
unfortunately so it's it can be prone to

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.370 
unfortunately so it's it can be prone to
breakage<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.320> paint<00:06:07.590> scraps<00:06:12.110> this<00:06:13.110> is<00:06:13.229> my

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
breakage and paint scraps this is my

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.900 
breakage and paint scraps this is my
review<00:06:13.590> of<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.770> con<00:06:14.100> figure<00:06:14.430> so<00:06:14.669> if<00:06:14.760> you<00:06:14.820> have

I'll be here from two different films
