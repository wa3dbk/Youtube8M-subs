00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.210
 the 'mechanical orange' finally classified 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.099
 to the next round I'm also going alone 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.139
 Chile team as these two 

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.580
 contenders were only 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.470
 playing the classification whether they are 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.240
 first or second of this group 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.370
 remember to show you and Spain 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.710
 they were disqualified to practically 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.510
 out of the next phase in the second 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.970
 party that he presented also went to the 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.560
 same time but Spain ended 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.869
 ending their participation in the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.760
 world with a 3 to 0 leaving the cup and 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.770
 now without giving it to a new 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.730
 title contender by the World 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.039
 Brazil-2014 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.809
 holland really played very good chile 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.489
 he played backlash but they could 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.859
 really counteract the attacks 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.289
 Chilean the Dutch so in the end 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.179
 of accounts he robbed and company could 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.489
 hit two goals that percent the 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.379
 last minute they did not hit on the one 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.960
 killed completely the hopes of 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.479
 a first place in the group by part of 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.190
 chile so hollanda nothing else is 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.289
 waiting for the second place of the group to 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.299
 that in this case it could be mexico such 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.920
 once croatia or it could even be 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.469
 brazil and who is not yet 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.540
 Completed absolutely nothing as data 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.500
 curious to remember that holland by 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.320
 first time in 20 years he played 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.690
 all players but without any 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.550
 had the pseudonym or the name of ban 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.020
 it's very funny because we remember 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.330
 that they go persie were not playing in 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.470
 this party much less the others 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.869
 This ban good team but so 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.390
 of the results of the group b team 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.430
 let's see what will happen in the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.770
 next group that is in the group to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.119
 finalize today to see if 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 really the mexican team can 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.290
 move to the next round and then 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.030
 let's hope that we really go very 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.369
 well to Mexicans to see if it's true 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.680
 we can in this case pelearle the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.570
 go to the next round hollanda oa 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.970
 chili depending on what we need but 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.710
 first to beat Croatia this is the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.420
