talk<00:01:08.340> about<00:01:08.520> those<00:01:08.790> waves<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> were

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
talk about those waves because you were

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
talk about those waves because you were
saying<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.350> 500<00:01:10.920> miles<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.760> our<00:01:11.790> US

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
saying like 500 miles for our US

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.160 
saying like 500 miles for our US
audience<00:01:13.130> 800<00:01:14.130> kilometers<00:01:14.610> per<00:01:14.640> hour<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.689> our

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
audience 800 kilometers per hour for our

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
audience 800 kilometers per hour for our
global<00:01:16.860> audience<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> mean<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.119> just

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
global audience I mean it just

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.080 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:19.259> strength<00:01:20.100> involved<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.330> say<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:22.049> comes<00:01:22.320> presumably<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> strongest<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.890> follow<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.340> weaker<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.539 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.600> no<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.110> necessarily<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
correct or no not necessarily if you

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
correct or no not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> abandoned<00:01:30.540> ash<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.009> tsunami

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
remember in the abandoned ash a tsunami

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.700 
remember in the abandoned ash a tsunami
the<00:01:32.430> initial<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.600> was<00:01:33.810> bad<00:01:34.049> enough<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.560> then

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.819 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:34.860> had<00:01:35.360> essentially<00:01:36.360> wave<00:01:37.049> three<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> wave

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
we had essentially wave three and wave

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.580 
we had essentially wave three and wave
for<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.460> were<00:01:38.610> actually<00:01:39.000> higher<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.930> were

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
for which were actually higher and were

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.910 
for which were actually higher and were
so<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.939> damage<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.780> ongoing<00:01:43.170> right<00:01:43.890> now

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
so the the damage is ongoing right now

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.340 
so the the damage is ongoing right now
but<00:01:44.610> may<00:01:44.729> continue<00:01:45.270> over<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.600> next<00:01:45.689> several

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
but may continue over the next several

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.310 
but may continue over the next several
hours<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:48.180> talk<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:48.960> waves

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
hours because we talk about these waves

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
hours because we talk about these waves
that<00:01:49.590> come<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.070> each<00:01:50.420> successively<00:01:51.420> producing

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that come in each successively producing

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
that come in each successively producing

along the seashore because they are 150

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.410 
along the seashore because they are 150
kilometers<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.159> west<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.819> epicenter

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
kilometers to the west of the epicenter

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.720 
kilometers to the west of the epicenter
and<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.930> thing<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.290> moving<00:02:22.439> at<00:02:22.739> 800

and this thing is moving at 800

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.149 
and this thing is moving at 800
kilometers<00:02:24.299> per<00:02:24.329> hour<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.439> math<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.010> has

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
kilometers per hour do the math it has

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.970 
kilometers per hour do the math it has
certainly<00:02:26.489> arrived<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.480> arrived<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:28.470> quite
