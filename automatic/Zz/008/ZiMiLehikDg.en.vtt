00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Check the substrate before laying in the bathroom. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 The underlay must be level, load-bearing and dry. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 In order to keep the work flowing, we prepare the necessary material and tools. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Before we begin to penetrate the surface, we must determine the wet zones in the bathroom. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 These include: 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 whole floor 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 10 cm plinth on the walls 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 shower cabin zone and 50 cm outside it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 bath zone in the total wall height, as well as 50 cm outside the bath outline 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 floor to 50 cm above the sink and 50 cm to the sides 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 WC zone - as in the case of a washbasin. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 In order to reduce and equalize the absorbency of the substrate, it is primed. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 For this purpose, apply a roller or brush to the penetration agent evenly over the surface of the wet zones, leaving no splashes. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 There is no need to penetrate the wet zones to which the waterproofing will be applied. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 We use ATLAS UNI-GRUNT penetration emulsion for this purpose. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 ATLAS UNI-GRUNT balances the absorbency of the substrate, 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 it also has a high penetration capacity, which makes the treasure additionally reinforced. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 It increases the spreading of colors, glazed plaster layers and adhesives. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 It also improves bonding conditions for mortar. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 The product is delivered in ready-to-use form. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 In some situations, a 1: 1 dilution is allowed. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 UNI-GRUNT features fast drying times 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 thanks to which the next stages of working on the primed surface can be approached in as little as 2 hours. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 The next stage of the work is to make waterproofing on previously marked wet zones. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 We will use ATLAS WODER W for this purpose. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 It is a highly flexible, one-component, ready-to-use insulation available in 4.5 and 10kg packages. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 We do not combine it with other materials, do not dilute or thicken it. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 When we open the bucket, mix its contents to balance the consistency. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 It is recommended to use a slow-speed drill with a color mixer. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 ATLAS WODER W is recommended for sealing under-compressed surfaces. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 They form a light-type insulation. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 To increase adhesion, a thin layer of waterproofing can be brushed onto the substrate. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 ATLAS WODER W is highly flexible, 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 can be used on substrates made in underfloor and wall heating systems 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 and also to other deformable surfaces. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 They form a coating seal, forming a layer a few millimeters thick. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 It has a short drying time, has a high adhesion to typical building materials. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 For indoor use. Ideal for bathrooms, kitchens. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Allows you to visually assess the thickness and homogeneity of the applied layer 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 color and texture after drying. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Stretch the foil on the treasure in at least two layers, apply it with a brush or a steel spatula. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 We begin to build our own waterproofing layer from places where we will use tapes, corners and sealing rings. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 We immerse this accessory in a freshly applied WODER W brush. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 The first stuck element is the inner and outer corners. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Then glue the wall to the floor using a suitable foundation on the already glued corner. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 The next stage is to stick the tape to the inner connection between the walls. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 We also bond the appropriate sealing rings to the mounting passages. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 We begin to apply the second layer after the first drying, ie in about 3 hours. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Do not apply thicker layers than recommended or reduce drying time 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 because it can cause cracking drying waterproofing. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 After 24 hours, cover the coating after wetting with a floor, mortar or tile covering. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Protect sealed surfaces from water for about 3 days.
