 [Music] 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.389
 on facebook for a video you 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.700
 wait for the one from the recipe 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.320
 chicken nems I hope she goes in 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.480
 Anyway it's not that complicated 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.760
 would be nice that during the video is 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.090
 now we are in the kitchen 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.789
 bongo on the rise a little merad like that 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.130
 Recipe for chicken spring rolls opens 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.800
 has no little things so be very 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.269
 careful all about having meat 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.370
 chopped chicken that could do 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:38.000
 yourself or even find in the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.430
 trade we will invite 3 and alok 400 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.079
 grams of rice cakes that you 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.030
 will find the asians of your 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.690
 supermarket rice cakes that will serve 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.559
 to the preparation for the nems then 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.680
 we have soya beans in the green at 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.289
 background about 2 to 3 good spoon at 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.449
 carrot soup size in judgment in 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.980
 julienne forgiveness of little sticks 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.570
 you can do that it's very simple 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.949
 you can find on the internet if you 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.130
 do not know how to do 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.890
 then in the middle bowl we have 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.150
 soy noodles so that's 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.890
 noodles that you also buy in 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.510
 the Asian region of your supermarket 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.810
 it's very simple you put them in 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.840
 the water about 3 4 minutes and then to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.700
 cold water and to finish with the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.710
 fillings will require mushrooms 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.930
 dehydrated blacks that you will have put 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.850
 finally following fashion from his will on 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.240
 I like ten minutes in the water 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.079
 boiling and to raise the salt taste 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.409
 pepper 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.380
 obviously a little soy sauce and 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.420
 for the end the tasting a little bit of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.909
 under this same the first thing to do 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.430
 it's very simple we're going to mix all 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.290
 the ingredients for the stuffing so the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.720
 soy vermicelli so about a 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.439
 good handle 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.810
 then the two spoons of sprouts 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.190
 soy then black mushrooms 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.790
 finely chop we class about 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.860
 3 4 tablespoons a pack 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.520
 usually these 25 grams and you 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:20.730
 can do two to three times the recipe 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:23.250
 and to finish the carrots about a 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.960
 half cut carrots 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:35.130
 is what you need to do now 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:37.280
 it's these areas and salt so pretty 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.750
 given generously 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.070
 what you can do is not 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.740
 an obligation if you want in 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.420
 according to your taste add a 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.690
 little teaspoon like this 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.330
 will give a good taste is now in 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.470
 the little Chinese was going tomorrow we 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.740
 will mix so weird Serbian if 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.700
 you do not want to do it alain bart does 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.350
 their technique and r 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.670
 what you want me it does not bother me 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.840
 so here we go and that's what you 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.670
 must obtain 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.620
 it's true that it can not be a little 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.780
 weird like this I rope you and 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.030
 now we will be able to move to the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.820
 first cooking in a pan a 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.690
 spoon of oil and go and there 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.800
 it's a pretty strong fire cooking during 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.100
 about 5 minutes 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.540
 you have to stir 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.790
 we see that it is well cooked it took 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.670
 a beautiful color and now we're going 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.550
 let it cool and we'll be able to 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.620
 prepare the student to prepare the spring rolls 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.470
 the little advice I can give you 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.570
 it's taking a towel and you 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.750
 go him mythified the wet a little 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.430
 little and prepare a drink 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.290
 so I loved him there you do not see 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.730
 but he is present is what we are going 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.370
 to make it wet the rice cakes 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.800
 so you take a little water at the beginning 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.690
 you have to put a lot but true when 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.920
 the lucky driver traber limits it 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.570
 will go much faster after 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.959
 few m 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:08.300
 the noise is well after maybe it 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.940
 maybe the name products do not 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.020
 do not do it like that I learned like 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.660
 that and I want to know well so here I am 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.989
 reproduce this technique and white so 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.860
 you have to wait for the cake to absorb 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.510
 well water because you have to know that 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.690
 it's not so complicated that we think the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.160
 same but it is necessary that the cake 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.870
 be well manageable there it is not yet 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.710
 the case there is a risk of tearing so 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.030
 that it is necessary to wait so that is there I am 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.240
 do not know if you can see the bobbin 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.190
 but she is good so you go 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.840
 here is to put it correctly 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.950
 rolling is the hardest thing 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.490
 so you might have some failures at 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.880
 start and there you go take one to 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.260
 two spoons here and you put it well 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.310
 at the end of the slab or to locate the 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.530
 yeah and then down here it's here 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:09.010
 so you put a good portion 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:13.430
 boss that's how you're doing well 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.979
 focus at the bottom center are rather 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.729
 stems can call it like that of the 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.800
 galette and where to do like these 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.970
 and that's really the point 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.320
 important because it has to be good 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.300
 is tense at the base otherwise it risks 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.830
 to break the cooking and not to make 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.080
 even pretty so here you want 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.340
 do not hesitate to bring back to you 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.979
 Once you are about 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.770
 half of the slab you go back 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:45.800
 on the side of the ends like these 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.960
 see the same from the side you are 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.390
 tap well really has to be it 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.750
 must really be tense and there 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.400
 hop you continue to roll your same 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.040
 to the end until the end of this 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.530
 to the end and here and there you will 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.470
 1.1 m or it's pretty thin if you 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.699
 want is no longer the shadow 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.410
 let's talk about the larger ones put a little 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.600
 more but I like them like that 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.620
 it crunched well loved and so here 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.720
 I will do all the other games well 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.570
 the museum I think and we end up 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.729
 just after for cooking 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.860
 that's the result so you get 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.870
 about 8 m 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.509
 and for cooking it's very simple to 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.919
 the fryer if you only have 8 or one 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.930
 small amount you can do everything 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.030
 in one go about 10 minutes in 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.500
 temperature of 100 degrees if we if you 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.030
 make for bigger the committee 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.010
 wanted to spend a first time five 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.570
 minutes and then five minutes each 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.669
 time to have a love hot 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.289
 so let's go for a powerful so 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.639
 this is gone we will put four same I 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.600
 I'm like that to have some 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.600
 shows for after tasting 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.520
 we will cook the cards even thought about them 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.620
 turn if it does not cover the 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.849
 entirely 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.340
 damn we see that spring rolls at prices a 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.620
 beautiful color get out of the oil and 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.060
 Drain them on kitchen paper paper 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.720
 we find ourselves directly for the 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.970
 tasting 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.039
 here's a little idea two presentations 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.169
 so thanks to marc cherry who realized 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.210
 this little z with a little salad 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.310
 sauce for spring rolls and well 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.080
 obviously the same questions so 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.970
 we go for the tasting which 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.349
 already I show you they are frankly 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.570
 I find them very successful I'm not 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:20.900
 a follower personally ddm jean does 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:29.750
 rarely 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:31.099
 so that's gone I tasted war on a 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.030
 something crispy we have 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:34.970
 something that tastes 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.199
 and it's not dry I know that a lot of 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.590
 people do not like spring rolls at 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.389
 chicken 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.760
 because he finds that sexy you cook 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:42.080
 not too strong the chicken is well cut 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.210
 I can guarantee you that it's a pure 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.949
 delight I hope this video as well
