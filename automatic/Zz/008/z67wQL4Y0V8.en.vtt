00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:47.130 

and<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:37.390> have<00:01:41.280> Fisher<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.429> here<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.810> hard<00:01:47.020> to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
and we have Fisher in here it's hard to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.240 
and we have Fisher in here it's hard to
see<00:01:47.380> them<00:01:47.530> at<00:01:47.920> any<00:01:48.159> time<00:01:49.079> even<00:01:50.079> now<00:01:50.109> you<00:01:50.439> see

the<00:01:51.369> reflection<00:01:51.520> there<00:01:53.880> that'll<00:01:54.880> out<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
the reflection there that'll out the

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.809 
the reflection there that'll out the
other<00:01:55.420> tilapia<00:01:56.140> there's<00:01:56.380> like<00:01:56.530> seven<00:01:56.979> tilapia

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
other tilapia there's like seven tilapia

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.679 
other tilapia there's like seven tilapia
and<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:01.479> have<00:02:01.719> their<00:02:01.929> own<00:02:01.959> little<00:02:02.319> places

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
here let's go in the other one here and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.210 
here let's go in the other one here and
you<00:02:08.379> can<00:02:08.590> see<00:02:10.440> they<00:02:11.440> all<00:02:11.590> have<00:02:11.920> their<00:02:12.190> little

you can see they all have their little

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:21.140 
you can see they all have their little
apartment<00:02:15.180> 4<00:02:16.180> inch<00:02:16.390> PVC<00:02:17.430> pipe<00:02:18.430> apartments<00:02:19.299> and

up<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.470> step<00:03:16.530> said<00:03:17.530> maybe<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.280> get<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.609> from

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
up the step said maybe I can get in from

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.259 
up the step said maybe I can get in from
the<00:03:18.910> top<00:03:19.150> he<00:03:19.540> took<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:21.239> rock<00:03:23.130> pull<00:03:24.130> back<00:03:24.669> at<00:03:25.090> the

bow - there's my belt back there so it

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.620 
bow - there's my belt back there so it
looks<00:03:28.209> like

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
looks like

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.230 
looks like
