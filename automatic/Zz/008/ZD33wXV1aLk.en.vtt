I can't guarantee that having these
settings<00:00:18.600> will<00:00:18.750> work<00:00:19.080> every<00:00:19.830> single<00:00:20.160> time<00:00:20.400> for

every single microphone but give it a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.200 
every single microphone but give it a
shot<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.460> lot<00:00:23.609> simpler<00:00:23.910> than<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
shot it's a lot simpler than the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.689

a buzz it doesn't matter just where
you're<00:03:39.510> not<00:03:39.720> talking<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.290> then<00:03:41.190> guys<00:03:41.400> you're

you're not talking and then guys you're
going<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.880> go<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.299> noise<00:03:42.570> profile<00:03:43.290> basically

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
going to go get noise profile basically

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.830 
going to go get noise profile basically
this<00:03:44.310> gets<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.670> little<00:03:44.940> area<00:03:45.239> gets<00:03:45.660> any

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
this gets that little area gets any

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.080 
this gets that little area gets any
noises<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.620> area<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.190> eliminates<00:03:47.910> them

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
noises in that area and eliminates them

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.180 
noises in that area and eliminates them
from<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.450> rest<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> audio<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.890> any

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
from the rest of the audio so any

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.979 
from the rest of the audio so any
buzzing<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.790> humming<00:03:51.030> any<00:03:51.390> fluttering

whatever<00:03:52.320> will<00:03:52.620> disappear<00:03:53.190> alright<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.760> get

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
whatever will disappear alright you get

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.280 
whatever will disappear alright you get
that<00:03:54.060> noise<00:03:54.239> profile<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.900> will<00:03:54.989> go<00:03:55.109> back

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
that noise profile and it will go back

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.020 
that noise profile and it will go back
to<00:03:55.320> your<00:03:55.590> normal<00:03:55.680> clip<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.489> won't<00:03:56.700> look<00:03:56.880> any

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
to your normal clip it won't look any

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.309 
to your normal clip it won't look any
different<00:03:57.299> what<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.019> highlight

the entire clip then you go effect you
go<00:04:00.930> get<00:04:01.340> noise<00:04:02.340> removal<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.299> press<00:04:03.450> ok<00:04:03.870> it

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
go get noise removal and you press ok it

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.720 
go get noise removal and you press ok it
should<00:04:04.350> be<00:04:04.380> alright<00:04:04.590> default<00:04:05.100> so<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.670> just

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
should be alright default so you just

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
entire little wave bar whatever them

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.729 
entire little wave bar whatever them
like<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.269> called<00:04:12.420> will<00:04:12.930> shrink<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.590> little

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
like it's called will shrink a little

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.310 
like it's called will shrink a little
bit<00:04:13.950> right<00:04:14.549> now<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.389> just<00:04:15.690> want<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.900> check<00:04:16.109> and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
bit right now you just want to check and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.349 
bit right now you just want to check and
see<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.859> sounds<00:04:17.310> alright<00:04:17.669> just<00:04:18.000> go<00:04:18.120> over

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
see if the sounds alright just go over

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.839 
see if the sounds alright just go over
the<00:04:18.450> entire<00:04:18.750> video<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:21.600> should<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:22.049> an

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
the entire video and that should be an

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.930 
the entire video and that should be an
amplified<00:04:23.930> amplified<00:04:24.930> version<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:26.159> quieter

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
amplified amplified version of a quieter

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.530 
amplified amplified version of a quieter
my

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
my

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.390 
my
profound<00:04:27.780> input<00:04:28.260> which<00:04:28.860> means<00:04:29.160> there's<00:04:29.370> a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
profound input which means there's a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.370 
profound input which means there's a
little<00:04:29.700> less<00:04:29.850> feedback<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.660> all<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.170> sort

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
little less feedback and all that sort

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.440 
little less feedback and all that sort
of<00:04:31.470> crap<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:32.280> hope<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:32.940> really<00:04:33.120> helped<00:04:33.390> you

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
also the following few little noise

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.910 
also the following few little noise
clips<00:04:39.300> are<00:04:39.450> examples<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:40.200> all<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.530> tips<00:04:40.740> I've

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
clips are examples of all the tips I've

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.240 
clips are examples of all the tips I've
shown<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.450> each<00:04:42.450> little<00:04:42.780> step<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.950> very

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
shown you each little step so the very

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.430 
shown you each little step so the very
first<00:04:44.310> recording<00:04:45.060> with<00:04:45.180> normal<00:04:45.510> settings<00:04:45.900> the

first recording with normal settings the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.500 
first recording with normal settings the
optimal<00:04:47.010> settings<00:04:47.400> after<00:04:48.090> it's<00:04:48.450> been

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
optimal settings after it's been

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.390 
optimal settings after it's been
amplified<00:04:48.810> after<00:04:49.440> it's<00:04:49.560> been<00:04:49.710> noisy<00:04:50.010> removed

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400
