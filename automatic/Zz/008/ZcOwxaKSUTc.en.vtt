00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 I finds katharina and today we make 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.850
 something sweet again and you can 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.730
 to enjoy the coffee on sunday or 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.420
 as a birthday cake use and indeed 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.550
 is this my 30 chocolate cake with 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.669
 coffee and the super delicious and delicious 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.680
 super juicy and really perfect me 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 always make a small good everything 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.309
 over half a springform you can do that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 whole will double but mostly is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.489
 But not so much cake 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.300
 because many come first because of that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.530
 I like to do half a percent 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.660
 and what I like doing that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.579
 whole in even smaller shapes so 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.010
 either you make it into shapes 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.890
 or I have so small, for example 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 ball shapes that I find super league 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.579
 not mentioned and you can too 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 do and let 's see what 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.770
 we need for the cake and indeed 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 we need brown and white sugar too 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.650
 same parts and then points need 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.570
 we cocoa powder and that is back chocolate 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.740
 then mother's milk needs power 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.829
 cake super juicy baking powder and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.000
 soda some vegetable oil for example 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.860
 sunflower oil then of course mail then 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.570
 passé and the coffee good the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.710
 chocolate taste really nice 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.750
 out and more chocolate dark and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 so and so we are now beginning to know 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.649
 when you have a job with chips 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.210
 Of course you can take that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.009
 spares you this step but me 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 find that easy in a supermarket 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 not and that's why I'm doing now 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.369
 myself chocolate chips in which I 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.100
 chocolate coarsely chop the so they 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.920
 still in 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:07.360
 relatively large pieces say that makes 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.429
 with the dark chocolate so too 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.860
 We would have and now we take care of each other 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.860
 our dry ingredients so dry 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.709
 spectators in a mail then ours 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 soda and our baking powder the whole 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:27.340
 I miss that so well 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.739
 is more distributed and now gives mine 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.950
 chocolate pieces to do that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.590
 that's why walls in the flour 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.720
 turned or are encased by de-mail 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.260
 are better distributed later on 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.890
 dough and do not fall all to the ground of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.890
 our cake form 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.670
 so and now only the cocoa powder 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.290
 and then we will 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.530
 already done with our dry 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.530
 ingredients 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.330
 so and now take care of the rest 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.060
 we only really together now 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.380
 mix what is left now 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.990
 the one strike ever before 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.930
 so that everything is easier in the end 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.930
 Then the sugar is added 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.459
 the buttermilk chassis and oil and everything 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.459
 is mixed well 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.709
 who wants to can vanilla now 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.329
 to give humana or vanilla extract ever 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.530
 after what you have but you can 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.530
 let it out completely 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.940
 so now we bring both together 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.379
 and stir it only until the flour 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.959
 not to be seen any more 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.790
 dry spots are more visible because 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.230
 we have a really nice fluffy and 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.189
 want to have juicy cakes and if 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.510
 stir with too long then the cake 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.659
 dry and hard and we want that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.659
 Not 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.870
 so now the whole thing just has to be in 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.930
 our form and indeed take here so 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.200
 a little bub form that I previously 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.970
 The dough is pretty much used 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800
 strong on so you can also have one 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.780
 feel a little less pure than me 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.510
 and then I have one more 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.320
 Ball reshape and alleged teddy bear 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.160
 and the whole thing goes on for 25 to 30 minutes 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.470
 in the oven at 180 degrees above and 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.510
 under heat or previously went into pure 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.610
 and it comes out dry again 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.680
 so if everything is cool it could 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.970
 decorate with icing sugar and 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.470
 finished is very delicious 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:00.640
 chocolate cake so I 've got it 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.140
 a little cake in shape for you 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.240
 clenched so that you can try 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.730
 the other cities will be 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.010
 given away or would you also like to times 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:14.340
 show how juicy offender is so 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.340
 Look at it a bit 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.500
 really to fool you 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.530
 that so juicy and so chocolate this 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.690
 Light from the café super delicious 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.850
 and then you sometimes know that too 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.730
 pieces of the chocolate from the 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.230
 white or dark chocolate 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.660
 is really the hammer 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.930
 it really is for sugar and army 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.420
 not super cute but just 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.030
 right and so the chocolate dahl the 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.040
 Coffee together really fit perfectly 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.140
 together try it out 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.420
 as I said there are currently as always 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.280
 also held point comes that is one 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.660
 half percent you can do twice as much 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.670
 you can do it in small form 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.830
 there are no fantasies 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:13.020
 borders 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.020
 and we commit ourselves why why until then
