00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
this you know last installment of the

this you know last installment of the
Ezio<00:02:23.590> trilogy<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.160> think<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.940> people

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
Ezio trilogy I think a lot of people

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.090 
Ezio trilogy I think a lot of people
look<00:02:25.690> at<00:02:25.780> Assassin's<00:02:26.260> Creed<00:02:26.470> they<00:02:26.620> enjoyed

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
look at Assassin's Creed they enjoyed

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.890 
look at Assassin's Creed they enjoyed
the<00:02:27.340> concepts<00:02:27.850> presented<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.480> first<00:02:28.660> game

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the concepts presented in the first game

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.210 
the concepts presented in the first game
I<00:02:28.930> think<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.260> second<00:02:29.590> game<00:02:29.680> obviously<00:02:30.070> got<00:02:30.190> a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
I think the second game obviously got a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.100 
I think the second game obviously got a
lot<00:02:30.280> more<00:02:30.490> right<00:02:30.940> refined<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.810> lot<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
lot more right refined a lot of the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.790 
lot more right refined a lot of the
gameplay

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
gameplay

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.140 
gameplay
what<00:02:33.100> type<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.280> refinements<00:02:34.030> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
what type of refinements and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.340 
what type of refinements and
enhancements<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.870> expect<00:02:35.170> in

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
enhancements can we expect in

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.450 
enhancements can we expect in
Revelations<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.070> are<00:02:36.130> going<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.310> really

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
Revelations that are going to really

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.100 
Revelations that are going to really
take<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.850> franchise<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.720> where<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.930> think

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
take this franchise to where you think

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.230 
take this franchise to where you think
it<00:02:38.200> could<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.650> should<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:39.070> yeah<00:02:39.940> essentially

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
it could and should be yeah essentially

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.790 
it could and should be yeah essentially
you're<00:02:40.630> right<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:40.870> every<00:02:41.200> Assassin's<00:02:41.620> Creed

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
you're right like every Assassin's Creed

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.590 
you're right like every Assassin's Creed
game<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.130> us<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.459> needs<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.150> sort<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.390> an

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
game for us it needs to be sort of an

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.930 
game for us it needs to be sort of an
iterative<00:02:44.320> process<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.920> keep<00:02:45.160> building<00:02:45.400> upon

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
iterative process we keep building upon

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.400 
iterative process we keep building upon
what<00:02:45.970> we've<00:02:46.300> sort<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.690> achieved<00:02:47.020> in<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> game

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
what we've sort of achieved in the game

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.080 
what we've sort of achieved in the game
before<00:02:47.560> listen<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.670> fans<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:49.030> to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.330 
to consolidate all of that into more of
a<00:03:01.480> sort<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.780> core<00:03:02.020> experience<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.190> we're

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
a sort of a core experience so we're

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.860 
a sort of a core experience so we're
doing<00:03:03.580> we're<00:03:03.760> adding<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.150> lot<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.390> systems<00:03:04.750> that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
doing we're adding a lot of systems that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.660 
doing we're adding a lot of systems that
really<00:03:05.170> help<00:03:05.440> bridge<00:03:05.890> everything<00:03:06.250> together

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
really help bridge everything together

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.130 
really help bridge everything together
you<00:03:07.150> know<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.420> hook<00:03:07.570> blade<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> good

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you know the hook blade is a good

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.660 
you know the hook blade is a good
example<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.890> sort<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.160> an<00:03:09.280> ottoman

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
example this is sort of an ottoman

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.390 
example this is sort of an ottoman
improvement<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> assassin's<00:03:11.410> blade<00:03:11.590> what

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
improvement to the assassin's blade what

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.580 
improvement to the assassin's blade what
this<00:03:12.550> does<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.120> essentially<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.470> know

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
this does is it essentially you know

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.670 
this does is it essentially you know
allows<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.760> character<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:17.320> know<00:03:17.440> be

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
allows the character to you know be

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.220 
allows the character to you know be
about<00:03:17.950> 25<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.670> 30%<00:03:18.940> faster<00:03:19.360> navigation<00:03:20.080> it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
about 25 to 30% faster navigation it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.410 
about 25 to 30% faster navigation it
adds<00:03:20.380> more<00:03:20.650> flow<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.790> also<00:03:21.970> bridges

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
adds more flow and it also bridges

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.150 
adds more flow and it also bridges
navigation<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.019> combat<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.530> really<00:03:23.799> makes

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
navigation in combat it really makes

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.620 
navigation in combat it really makes
those<00:03:24.370> two<00:03:24.580> things<00:03:24.850> sort<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.090> more<00:03:25.299> linked

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
those two things sort of more linked

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.030 
those two things sort of more linked
Sasson<00:03:26.230> screed<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.530> all<00:03:26.650> about<00:03:26.830> movement

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
user-friendly so he falls directly

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.170 
user-friendly so he falls directly
through<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.610> white<00:05:58.760> room<00:05:58.910> because<00:05:59.090> his

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
through the white room because his

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.670 
through the white room because his
consciousness<00:05:59.690> too<00:05:59.870> weak<00:06:00.020> falls<00:06:00.350> into<00:06:00.530> the
