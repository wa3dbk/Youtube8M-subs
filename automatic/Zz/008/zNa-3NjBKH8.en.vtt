00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.920 
from
to<00:02:14.020> see<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> works<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.420> I've<00:02:16.420> got<00:02:16.480> another

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
to see if it works and I've got another

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.750 
to see if it works and I've got another
windows<00:02:17.379> seven<00:02:17.739> core<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.220> machine<00:02:18.580> also

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
windows seven core to machine also

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.699 
windows seven core to machine also
that's<00:02:19.090> waiting<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.319> actually

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
that's waiting for that is actually

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.740 
that's waiting for that is actually
working<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.250> an<00:02:21.400> upgrade<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.450> thinking

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
working on an upgrade but it's thinking

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.960 
working on an upgrade but it's thinking
very<00:02:22.989> very<00:02:23.290> long<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.099> believe<00:02:24.580> that

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
very very long so I believe that

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.330 
very very long so I believe that
depending<00:02:25.569> on<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:26.019> complex<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.890> machine<00:02:27.190> is

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
depending on how complex and machine is

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
depending on how complex and machine is
if<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.910> upgrade<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.569> keep<00:02:28.750> everything<00:02:29.110> all

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
if you upgrade and keep everything all

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.650 
if you upgrade and keep everything all
the<00:02:29.890> programs<00:02:30.340> everything<00:02:30.940> that's<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.390> your

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the programs everything that's on your

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.800 
the programs everything that's on your
computer<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.290> might<00:02:32.980> be<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.519> really<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.269> complex

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
computer it might be a really a complex

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.229 
computer it might be a really a complex
issue<00:02:34.989> might<00:02:35.380> take<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> long<00:02:35.800> time<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.880> be

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
issue might take a long time so be

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.530 
issue might take a long time so be
patient<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:38.319> some<00:02:38.910> installs<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.180> lot<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.420> people

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
patient on some installs a lot of people

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.809 
patient on some installs a lot of people
telling<00:02:40.840> me<00:02:41.049> they've<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.590> took<00:02:41.769> from<00:02:41.920> 30<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.250> 45

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
telling me they've it took from 30 to 45

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.740 
telling me they've it took from 30 to 45
minutes<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.269> many<00:02:43.450> cases<00:02:44.040> others<00:02:45.040> longer<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
minutes in many cases others longer and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.180 
minutes in many cases others longer and
so<00:02:47.110> depending<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.830> speed<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.069> your

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
so depending on the speed of your

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.160 
so depending on the speed of your
machine<00:02:48.610> depending<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> hard

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
machine depending on if you have a hard

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.680 
drive regular or drive SSD and so on
there's<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.750> lot<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.959> things<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.410> can<00:02:53.560> go

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
there's a lot of things that can go

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.229 
there's a lot of things that can go
faster<00:02:55.690> or<00:02:55.720> slower<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.590> keep<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.430> mind<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.730> we
