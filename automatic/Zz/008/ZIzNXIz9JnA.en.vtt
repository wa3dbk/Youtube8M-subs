the 20th century the breed was refined
and<00:01:50.040> they<00:01:50.220> started<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> stud<00:01:51.060> book<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
and they started the stud book and

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.030 
and they started the stud book and
started<00:01:53.250> registering<00:01:53.430> them<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.770> they<00:01:55.770> then

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
started registering them and they then

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
started registering them and they then
changed<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.119> were<00:01:57.270> no<00:01:57.420> longer<00:01:57.600> allowed

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
changed when they were no longer allowed

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
changed when they were no longer allowed
to<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.740> bear<00:01:58.979> baiting<00:01:59.219> bull<00:01:59.610> baiting<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to do bear baiting bull baiting and that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.289 
to do bear baiting bull baiting and that
sort<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:01.320> were<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.619> used<00:02:02.299> by

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
sort of thing they were then used by

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.999 
sort of thing they were then used by
hunters<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
hunters they would go out with the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.550 
hunters they would go out with the
hunting<00:02:05.310> dogs<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.750> an<00:02:07.020> animal<00:02:07.380> was

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
hunting dogs and when an animal was

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
hunting dogs and when an animal was
cornered<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.099> caught<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.640> box<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:09.000> hold<00:02:09.239> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
cornered or caught the box would hold on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
cornered or caught the box would hold on
to<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> animal<00:02:10.020> until<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> hunter<00:02:11.009> got<00:02:11.160> there

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
to the animal until the hunter got there

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.260 
to the animal until the hunter got there
to<00:02:11.459> dispatch<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> end

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
to dispatch the end

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.990 
to dispatch the end
so<00:02:13.110> they've<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> very<00:02:13.710> specific<00:02:14.000> head

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so they've got a very specific head

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.690 
so they've got a very specific head
structure<00:02:15.720> which<00:02:16.140> they<00:02:16.410> need<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.220> perform

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
structure which they need to perform

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
structure which they need to perform
that<00:02:17.880> task<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.930> there's<00:02:19.080> very<00:02:19.290> different

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that task so there's very different

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.140 
that task so there's very different
things<00:02:19.830> about<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.070> boxer<00:02:20.430> head<00:02:20.580> than<00:02:20.760> any<00:02:20.910> other

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
things about a boxer head than any other

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.380 
things about a boxer head than any other
normal<00:02:21.690> breed<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.950> example<00:02:23.460> they<00:02:23.640> their<00:02:24.090> bite

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
normal breed for example they their bite

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.690 
normal breed for example they their bite
they<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:25.590> what<00:02:25.740> we<00:02:25.770> call<00:02:25.890> under<00:02:26.250> shot<00:02:26.520> which

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
they are what we call under shot which

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030 
they are what we call under shot which
means<00:02:26.910> their<00:02:27.120> lower<00:02:27.300> jaw<00:02:27.570> goes<00:02:27.780> further<00:02:28.740> then

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
means their lower jaw goes further then

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
means their lower jaw goes further then
they<00:02:29.190> top<00:02:29.430> jaw<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:30.030> produces<00:02:30.210> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
they top jaw and that just produces a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.390 
they top jaw and that just produces a
very<00:02:30.900> strong<00:02:31.320> bite<00:02:31.560> Wow

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
more could I say regal

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.550 
more could I say regal
and<00:03:32.400> then<00:03:32.850> you've<00:03:33.030> got<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.600> UK<00:03:34.050> look<00:03:34.320> which<00:03:34.530> is

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and then you've got the UK look which is

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.100 
and then you've got the UK look which is
sort<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.400> between<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.360> South<00:03:36.600> Africa<00:03:36.990> we

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
sort of in between so in South Africa we

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.500 
sort of in between so in South Africa we
actually<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.740> all<00:03:38.070> three<00:03:38.550> styles

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
actually have all three styles

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.560 
actually have all three styles
okay<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.610> prevalence<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.090> country<00:03:42.540> I

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
okay so prevalence in this country I

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.330 
okay so prevalence in this country I
would<00:03:42.720> say<00:03:42.960> probably<00:03:43.170> even<00:03:43.650> between<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
would say probably even between the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.310 
would say probably even between the
three<00:03:44.580> styles<00:03:45.090> but<00:03:45.600> if<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.840> go<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.050> Europe

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
three styles but if you go to Europe

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.020 
three styles but if you go to Europe

very<00:03:54.420> interesting<00:03:55.020> because<00:03:55.200> he<00:03:55.620> actually<00:03:55.950> has

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
very interesting because he actually has

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.120 
very interesting because he actually has
both<00:03:56.760> European<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.660> American<00:03:58.080> blood<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.890> him
