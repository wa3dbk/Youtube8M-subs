he started because you know it was the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.670 
he started because you know it was the
system<00:05:19.600> because<00:05:20.600> the<00:05:20.870> system<00:05:20.900> itself<00:05:21.500> was

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
system because the system itself was

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.230 
system because the system itself was
like<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:21.860> know<00:05:21.980> I<00:05:22.160> was<00:05:22.820> leading<00:05:23.060> the

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
like you know I was leading the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.140 
like you know I was leading the
corruption<00:05:23.840> and<00:05:23.990> stuff<00:05:24.230> and<00:05:24.940> because<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:25.970> that

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
corruption and stuff and because of that

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.050 
corruption and stuff and because of that
oh<00:05:26.540> we<00:05:27.050> totally<00:05:27.200> started<00:05:27.680> disliking<00:05:27.890> a<00:05:28.640> lot<00:05:28.880> of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
oh we totally started disliking a lot of

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.290 
oh we totally started disliking a lot of
stuff<00:05:29.420> and<00:05:29.750> that's<00:05:30.710> kind<00:05:31.040> of<00:05:31.100> what<00:05:31.280> led<00:05:31.490> him<00:05:31.610> to

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
stuff and that's kind of what led him to

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.470 
stuff and that's kind of what led him to
start<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.990> war<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.490> mean<00:05:34.669> overall<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.210> mean

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
point like it wasn't it was it's weird

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.760 
point like it wasn't it was it's weird
to<00:05:44.960> script<00:05:45.200> like<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.500> wasn't<00:05:45.890> bad<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:47.770> it

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
to script like it wasn't bad and it

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.560 
to script like it wasn't bad and it
wasn't<00:05:49.130> like<00:05:49.370> attack<00:05:49.700> on<00:05:49.820> time<00:05:50.030> level<00:05:50.360> but<00:05:50.480> it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
wasn't like attack on time level but it

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.830 
wasn't like attack on time level but it
was<00:05:51.290> still<00:05:51.680> like<00:05:51.950> to<00:05:52.160> me<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.430> was<00:05:52.550> on<00:05:52.700> point<00:05:53.300> the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
was still like to me it was on point the

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.600 
was still like to me it was on point the
animation<00:05:54.320> was<00:05:54.440> great<00:05:54.710> and<00:05:55.130> it's<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.400> great
