00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.770
 or people like us have a new 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.899
 video of a good tutorial teaching of 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.150
 how to record the skype call with the 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.800
 culture now the cat if I have the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.119
 spending culture and that's my problem 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.660
 main thing that I play with chicken like 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.779
 any other friend and can not record 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.350
 because he hears us his voice then I found 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.600
 the solution 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.570
 as well as an example that I can put that 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.820
 if it serves the gameplay by destroying everything 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 where gta where I played with chickens and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.240
 our two voices 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 because good first we're going to need 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.650
 a program called virtual audio 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 keyboard like us in English I'm not 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.780
 very good now 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 and will be installed first in the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 Our folder as shown can 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.230
 leave in the description 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.800
 to a download they will install it here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.360
 this 32 bits of 24 bits here are going 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.989
 prophetic states hierarchy 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.270
 this is for 64 bits and this is for 32 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.440
 bits 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 good to do here the audio repeats 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.920
 let's say the microphone anyone who 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 you have to go to the two here is 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.020
 that the audio in this way is going to 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.680
 be in it like that here is going I am in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.680
 audio medium 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 then they go to skype tools 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.640
 options 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.270
 sound configuration and they're going to give that 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.130
 the audio output goes to line 3 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.390
 ok would the voices of his friends be 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.170
 go to line 3 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.170
 to save 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 and then simply 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.160
 the folder opens another audio repeat this 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.160
 they will not do it 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.310
 okay 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.920
 and they go that line 3 that is skype be in 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.390
 line 2 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.960
 is 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.230
 and that's how simple it is 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.350
 you can leave 1 and 2 or only 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.150
 after the e3 it does not matter you will need 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.970
 everything as long as they do so similar 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.420
 it does not matter is that one removed with such 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.730
 that have done all this well and until 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 then as they left the microphone in 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 line 2002 also here there is one that calls 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.960

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.700
 internal microphone the game with which the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:52.790
 microphone to part line 1 in 2003 then 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.700
 put line 2 and you can record what 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.290
 they commented and now I do not have the culture 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.170
