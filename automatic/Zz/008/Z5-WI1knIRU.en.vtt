00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
hair off post that's a question that we

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.450 
hair off post that's a question that we
do<00:02:31.150> get<00:02:31.360> from<00:02:31.540> time<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.870> time<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.320> race<00:02:32.980> tear<00:02:33.280> off

what<00:02:35.830> they<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> thin<00:02:36.580> piece<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.820> plastic

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
what they are is a thin piece of plastic

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.990 
what they are is a thin piece of plastic
film<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.320> can<00:02:38.440> put<00:02:38.650> from<00:02:39.340> one<00:02:39.550> coast<00:02:39.820> to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
film that you can put from one coast to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.830 
film that you can put from one coast to
the<00:02:40.090> next<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.690> they<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.200> basically<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:42.840> piece

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the next and they have basically a piece

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.750 
the next and they have basically a piece
that<00:02:43.870> extends<00:02:44.590> off<00:02:44.740> so<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.070> can<00:02:45.160> tear<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.550> off

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that extends off so you can tear it off

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.460 
that extends off so you can tear it off
as<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.090> go<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:46.750> you're<00:02:46.930> out<00:02:47.050> there<00:02:47.320> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
as you go so if you're out there and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.200 
as you go so if you're out there and
you're<00:02:48.100> collecting<00:02:48.520> bugs<00:02:48.790> while<00:02:49.060> you're

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
racing into a road debris and it gets on

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.710 
racing into a road debris and it gets on
the<00:02:51.430> tear-off<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:52.090> not<00:02:52.240> on<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> shield

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the tear-off it's not on the shield

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.810 
the tear-off it's not on the shield
itself<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.800> can<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.100> go<00:02:54.220> ahead<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.370> grab<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
itself you can just go ahead and grab it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.170 
itself you can just go ahead and grab it
and<00:02:54.940> let<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.870> tear-off<00:02:56.200> go<00:02:56.820> probably<00:02:57.820> not<00:02:57.970> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and let the tear-off go probably not the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.380 
and let the tear-off go probably not the
most<00:02:59.040> used<00:03:00.040> thing<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.610> street<00:03:00.880> riding<00:03:01.090> you'd

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
most used thing for street riding you'd

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.850 
most used thing for street riding you'd
probably<00:03:01.630> get<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> ticket<00:03:02.140> if<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.410> got<00:03:02.620> caught

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
probably get a ticket if you got caught

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.980 
probably get a ticket if you got caught

if you want to ride with it cracked a
little<00:03:27.190> bit<00:03:27.520> it'll<00:03:27.700> do<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.330> hold<00:03:28.510> its

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
little bit it'll do that and hold its

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.080 
little bit it'll do that and hold its

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
finger in there push down and then just

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.420 
finger in there push down and then just
kind<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.780> grab<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.290> right<00:03:47.380> here<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.769> pull<00:03:48.190> out

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
kind of grab it right here and pull out

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.710 
kind of grab it right here and pull out
and<00:03:48.730> up<00:03:49.560> let's<00:03:50.560> go<00:03:50.739> ahead<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.300> do<00:03:52.300> that<00:03:52.330> for

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
and up let's go ahead and do that for

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.320 
and up let's go ahead and do that for
the<00:03:52.810> other<00:03:52.930> side<00:03:53.200> as<00:03:53.440> well<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> little

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
the other side as well this is a little

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.880 
the other side as well this is a little
bit<00:03:55.450> different<00:03:55.810> than<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.170> shield<00:03:56.410> mechanism

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
bit different than the shield mechanism

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.160 
bit different than the shield mechanism
that<00:03:57.010> I've<00:03:57.130> seen<00:03:57.400> on<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:58.570> other<00:03:58.690> agv<00:03:59.140> helmets

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
that I've seen on the other agv helmets

that I've seen on the other agv helmets
the<00:03:59.800> one<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.130> GP<00:04:00.430> tech<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:00.880> new<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.870> seems<00:04:02.200> to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
the one the GP tech is new it seems to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.140 
the one the GP tech is new it seems to
work<00:04:02.590> quite<00:04:02.620> well<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.400> we'll<00:04:03.610> note<00:04:03.790> i<00:04:03.820> think

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
work quite well and we'll note i think

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.759 
work quite well and we'll note i think
the<00:04:04.269> other<00:04:04.300> ones<00:04:04.630> previously<00:04:05.170> were<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> little

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
the other ones previously were a little

the other ones previously were a little
bit<00:04:05.980> easier<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:06.580> still<00:04:07.269> at<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.480> end<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.630> the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
bit easier but still at the end of the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.930 
bit easier but still at the end of the
day<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.230> really<00:04:08.769> wasn't<00:04:08.980> too<00:04:09.220> difficult<00:04:09.430> to

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940
