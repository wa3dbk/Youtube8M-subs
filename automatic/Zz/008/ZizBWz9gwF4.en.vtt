00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
do that is just to boil it in hot water

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
do that is just to boil it in hot water
and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.690> you're<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> add<00:00:55.559> enough

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and then you're just going to add enough

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
and then you're just going to add enough
just<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.850> room-temperature<00:00:57.600> water

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
just this is just room-temperature water

just this is just room-temperature water
to<00:00:58.320> cover<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.680> all<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> seeds<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to cover up all of the seeds that you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
to cover up all of the seeds that you
have<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.170> you're<00:01:01.320> gonna<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
have then what you're gonna do is get

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
have then what you're gonna do is get
yourself<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.430> coffee<00:01:02.670> filter<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.170> layers

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
yourself a coffee filter or two layers

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080

of<00:01:04.559> cheesecloth<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.489> put<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.760> over<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.060> top

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
of cheesecloth and put it over the top

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
of cheesecloth and put it over the top
and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.659> secure<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> rubber<00:01:08.010> band

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and then secure it with a rubber band

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
and then secure it with a rubber band
now<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:09.060> gonna<00:01:09.180> let<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> sit<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.930> your

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
now you're gonna let that sit on your

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.289 
now you're gonna let that sit on your
counter<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> direct<00:01:11.159> sunlight<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.970> about

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
going to drain the seeds and I just dump

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
going to drain the seeds and I just dump
them<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> coffee<00:01:18.720> filter<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> pour<00:01:19.470> some
