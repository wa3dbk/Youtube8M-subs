the<00:00:51.660> esram<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> works<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.699> as

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the esram is and how it works as well as

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.389 
the esram is and how it works as well as
some<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> challenges<00:00:54.829> but<00:00:55.829> only<00:00:56.070> way<00:00:56.160> on

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
some of the challenges but only way on

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.930 
some of the challenges but only way on
with<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> show<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> overall<00:00:58.940> theoretically

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
with the show so overall theoretically

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060 
with the show so overall theoretically
the<00:01:00.180> ps4<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.840> xbox<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> were<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the ps4 and xbox one if you were just to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.310 
the ps4 and xbox one if you were just to
look<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:02.579> basic<00:01:02.940> specifications

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
look at the very basic specifications

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
look at the very basic specifications
they<00:01:04.320> look<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.559> similar<00:01:04.979> both<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.880> using

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
they look very similar both for using

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
they look very similar both for using
the<00:01:06.240> AMD<00:01:06.570> Jaguar<00:01:06.810> CPU<00:01:07.260> both<00:01:08.189> using<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.909> gcn

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the AMD Jaguar CPU both using the gcn

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.539 
the AMD Jaguar CPU both using the gcn
cores<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.680> course<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> few

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
cores and of course there are a few

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.810 
cores and of course there are a few
changes<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.299> there<00:01:12.479> regarding<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.820> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
changes here and there regarding to you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
changes here and there regarding to you
know<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> clock<00:01:15.360> speeds<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.049> type<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> thing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
know the clock speeds that type of thing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
know the clock speeds that type of thing
but<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> basic<00:01:17.400> premise<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> console

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
but the basic premise of the console

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
but the basic premise of the console
seems<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:18.960> similar<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.740> only<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.009> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
seems very similar it's only when you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880 
seems very similar it's only when you
dig<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.610> deeper<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:21.960> at<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.590> actual

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
dig in deeper and you look at the actual

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
dig in deeper and you look at the actual
difference<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> T<00:01:24.240> flop<00:01:24.570> computing<00:01:25.080> power

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
difference in T flop computing power

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
difference in T flop computing power
between<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> ps4<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> xbox<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:27.119> well<00:01:27.479> as

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
between the ps4 and xbox one as well as

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.039 
between the ps4 and xbox one as well as
the<00:01:27.869> memory<00:01:28.880> system<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.240> both<00:01:30.420> consoles<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the memory system of both consoles that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.450 
the memory system of both consoles that
you<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.320> start<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.979> where<00:01:32.189> things

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you actually start to see where things

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.560 
you actually start to see where things
start<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> diverge<00:01:34.909> however<00:01:35.909> there's<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> very

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
start to diverge however there's a very

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.630 
start to diverge however there's a very
good<00:01:36.689> chance<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> xbox<00:01:37.770> one's<00:01:38.009> GPU

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
good chance that the xbox one's GPU

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
good chance that the xbox one's GPU
isn't<00:01:39.420> actually<00:01:39.570> causing<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.650> problem<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
isn't actually causing the problem and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.270 
isn't actually causing the problem and
we've<00:01:42.270> discussed<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.899> previously<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we've discussed this previously but it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399 
we've discussed this previously but it
seems<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.670> backed<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.570> both<00:01:45.899> tariffs<00:01:46.259> on

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
seems to be backed up as both tariffs on

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.420 
seems to be backed up as both tariffs on
software<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.750> respawn<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
software as well as respawn have kind of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.719 
software as well as respawn have kind of
hinted<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.479> further<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.799> we'll<00:01:53.280> start<00:01:53.579> out

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
hinted at further so we'll start out

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.450 
hinted at further so we'll start out
with<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.299> tariff<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.780> who<00:01:55.049> create<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.710> engine<00:01:56.310> at

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
with a tariff on who create an engine at

anyway but still they said if we do port

anyway but still they said if we do port

a very short interview my head but still

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.530 
a very short interview my head but still
have<00:02:33.830> said<00:02:34.070> we've<00:02:34.670> been<00:02:34.700> experimented<00:02:35.480> on

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
have said we've been experimented on

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.370 
have said we've been experimented on
making<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.170> higher<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.630> lower<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.140> by

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
making it higher and lower this is by

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.430 
making it higher and lower this is by
the<00:02:39.410> way<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.800> regards<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.400> do<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:41.440> resolution

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the way in regards to do the resolution

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.650 
the way in regards to do the resolution
of<00:02:42.620> titanfall<00:02:43.400> which<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.000> course<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.330> just

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
of titanfall which of course is just

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.020 
of titanfall which of course is just
seen<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> release<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.470> consoles<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.220> they

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
seen a release in the consoles and they

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.940 
seen a release in the consoles and they
said<00:02:47.270> one<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.020> big<00:02:48.230> tricks<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.680> how<00:02:48.830> much

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
said one of the big tricks is how much

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.050 
said one of the big tricks is how much
air<00:02:49.190> SRAM<00:02:49.550> we're<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:52.070> use<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.640> so

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
air SRAM we're going to to use and so

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.900 
air SRAM we're going to to use and so
we're<00:02:53.240> thinking<00:02:53.630> or<00:02:53.810> not<00:02:53.860> using<00:02:54.910> hardware

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
we're thinking or not using hardware

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.320 
we're thinking or not using hardware
MSAA<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:56.960> stage<00:02:57.200> using<00:02:57.440> FXAA<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:59.150> make

MSAA and this stage using FXAA to make

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.090 
MSAA and this stage using FXAA to make
it<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.600> we<00:02:59.720> don't<00:02:59.750> have<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.170> use<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.440> local<00:03:00.890> a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
it so we don't have to use the local a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.640 
it so we don't have to use the local a
lot<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.550> larger<00:03:01.970> render<00:03:02.270> target<00:03:02.750> we're

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
lot this larger render target we're

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.680 
lot this larger render target we're
going<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.130> experiment<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:05.060> target<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.510> either

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
going to experiment the target is either

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.360 
going to experiment the target is either

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
fxaa so we're trying to optimize we

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.200 
fxaa so we're trying to optimize we
don't<00:03:13.250> want<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.460> have<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.700> give<00:03:13.850> up<00:03:13.940> anything

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
don't want to have to give up anything

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.420 
don't want to have to give up anything
for<00:03:14.390> high<00:03:14.540> resolution<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.890> far<00:03:16.130> we're<00:03:16.310> not

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
for high resolution so far we're not

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.830 
for high resolution so far we're not
putting<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.700> hundred<00:03:16.940> percent<00:03:17.000> happy<00:03:17.510> with<00:03:17.660> how

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
putting a hundred percent happy with how

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.660 
putting a hundred percent happy with how
any<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> options<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.070> we're<00:03:19.460> still

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
any of the options and we're still

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.260 
any of the options and we're still
working<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.270> it<00:03:20.390> now<00:03:20.860> fxaa<00:03:21.860> is<00:03:22.220> definitely<00:03:23.000> a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
working on it now fxaa is definitely a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.330 
working on it now fxaa is definitely a
lot<00:03:23.570> cheaper<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:24.590> terms<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.070> performance

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
lot cheaper in terms of performance

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.720 
lot cheaper in terms of performance
usage<00:03:26.320> but<00:03:27.320> as<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.130> developers<00:03:28.550> have<00:03:28.700> stated

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
usage but as the developers have stated

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.250 
usage but as the developers have stated
it's<00:03:29.360> also<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.690> lot<00:03:30.020> more<00:03:30.230> expensive<00:03:30.620> intensive

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
it's also a lot more expensive intensive

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.170 
it's also a lot more expensive intensive
memory<00:03:33.260> use<00:03:33.470> which<00:03:33.740> is<00:03:33.980> primarily<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:35.000> bigger

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
memory use which is primarily the bigger

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.560 
memory use which is primarily the bigger
issue<00:03:35.390> now<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.290> good<00:03:36.560> part<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.370> also<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.450> good

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
issue now the good part of also the good

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.900 
issue now the good part of also the good
point<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.050> all<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:39.740> quite<00:03:40.670> simply

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
point of all this is that quite simply

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.510 
point of all this is that quite simply
put<00:03:41.360> it's<00:03:42.080> definitely<00:03:42.740> seems<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.160> be<00:03:43.190> an<00:03:43.370> issue

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
put it's definitely seems to be an issue

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.140 
put it's definitely seems to be an issue
with<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.300> amount<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.780> memory<00:03:45.250> available<00:03:46.250> on

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
the esram that's causing these issues

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.120 
the esram that's causing these issues
and<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.150> also<00:03:50.300> highlights<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.230> even<00:03:51.650> if<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
and it also highlights that even if the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
bottleneck because quite simply put it's

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.630 
bottleneck because quite simply put it's

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.390 
rendering pass and so that's not to say
that<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.930> esram<00:04:36.349> will<00:04:36.680> never<00:04:36.949> be<00:04:37.160> walked

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that the esram will never be walked

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.950 
that the esram will never be walked
around<00:04:37.849> but<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:39.259> certainly<00:04:40.069> seems<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.699> be<00:04:40.880> a

around but it certainly seems to be a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.350 
around but it certainly seems to be a
significant<00:04:41.960> hurdle<00:04:42.460> it's<00:04:43.460> very<00:04:43.699> interesting

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
significant hurdle it's very interesting

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.760 
solution and that's not really the case
they're<00:05:11.120> basically<00:05:11.449> just<00:05:11.660> trying<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:12.080> make

they're basically just trying to make

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.779 
they're basically just trying to make
this<00:05:12.979> thing<00:05:13.190> look<00:05:13.250> as<00:05:13.580> good<00:05:13.789> as<00:05:13.849> possible<00:05:14.449> them

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
this thing look as good as possible them

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.249 
this thing look as good as possible them
personally<00:05:16.789> speaking<00:05:17.120> I'm<00:05:17.449> unsure<00:05:17.630> if<00:05:18.110> I'd

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
personally speaking I'm unsure if I'd

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.800 
personally speaking I'm unsure if I'd
like<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.680> see<00:05:18.919> 1080p<00:05:19.669> without<00:05:19.909> a<00:05:20.060> Lee<00:05:20.180> about

like to see 1080p without a Lee about

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.850 
like to see 1080p without a Lee about

jag<00:05:25.280> is<00:05:25.490> not<00:05:26.240> really<00:05:26.509> ideal<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.650> think<00:05:27.770> 900

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520

people<00:05:28.669> of<00:05:28.819> FXAA<00:05:29.360> would<00:05:29.750> be<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.990> better

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
of why games developers are having

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.010 
of why games developers are having
problems<00:06:07.219> because<00:06:07.909> you<00:06:08.630> know<00:06:08.750> from<00:06:08.900> the

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
problems because you know from the

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.860 
problems because you know from the
perspective<00:06:09.530> of<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:10.159> owners<00:06:10.820> of<00:06:10.849> the<00:06:11.270> console

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
perspective of the owners of the console

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.990 
perspective of the owners of the console
a<00:06:12.110> lot<00:06:12.860> of<00:06:12.889> the<00:06:13.099> time<00:06:13.280> they<00:06:13.430> just<00:06:13.460> don't<00:06:13.820> really

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
a lot of the time they just don't really

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.060 
a lot of the time they just don't really
care<00:06:14.479> that<00:06:17.199> the<00:06:18.199> system<00:06:18.590> is<00:06:18.680> harder<00:06:19.039> to

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
care that the system is harder to

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.950 
care that the system is harder to
develop<00:06:19.550> for<00:06:19.759> they<00:06:20.360> just<00:06:20.570> want<00:06:20.719> the<00:06:20.810> best

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
develop for they just want the best

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.370 
develop for they just want the best
performance<00:06:21.500> possible<00:06:21.560> and<00:06:22.280> of<00:06:23.090> course<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.990> lot

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
performance possible and of course a lot

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.170 
performance possible and of course a lot
of<00:06:24.500> the<00:06:24.590> time<00:06:24.800> this<00:06:24.979> can<00:06:25.190> lead<00:06:25.370> quite<00:06:25.820> a<00:06:25.849> lot<00:06:26.090> of

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
of the time this can lead quite a lot of

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.110 
of the time this can lead quite a lot of
outrage<00:06:26.889> we've<00:06:27.889> seen<00:06:28.159> how<00:06:28.430> it<00:06:28.729> seems<00:06:28.940> to<00:06:29.030> be

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
outrage we've seen how it seems to be

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.820 
outrage we've seen how it seems to be
impacting<00:06:29.780> the<00:06:29.870> media<00:06:30.199> right<00:06:30.409> now<00:06:30.469> and<00:06:30.710> this

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
impacting the media right now and this

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.860 
impacting the media right now and this
definitely<00:06:31.070> seems<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.699> be<00:06:31.729> a<00:06:32.000> greater<00:06:32.599> level

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
definitely seems to be a greater level

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.040 
definitely seems to be a greater level
of<00:06:33.130> demand<00:06:34.130> from<00:06:34.759> fans<00:06:35.150> to<00:06:35.419> actually<00:06:35.690> really

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
of demand from fans to actually really

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.560 
of demand from fans to actually really
see<00:06:36.409> and<00:06:36.740> for<00:06:37.580> developers<00:06:38.029> to<00:06:38.060> tell<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.419> truth

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
see and for developers to tell the truth

see and for developers to tell the truth
in<00:06:38.810> explain<00:06:39.469> these<00:06:39.710> different<00:06:40.130> issues

particular video I'd like to speak about

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.340 
particular video I'd like to speak about
this<00:06:45.470> a<00:06:45.530> bit<00:06:45.650> further<00:06:46.130> now<00:06:46.940> we<00:06:47.000> do<00:06:47.330> have<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.660> GDC

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
this a bit further now we do have a GDC

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.680 
this a bit further now we do have a GDC
coming<00:06:49.130> up<00:06:49.250> pretty<00:06:49.460> soon<00:06:49.580> which<00:06:50.240> i<00:06:50.360> think<00:06:50.419> is

going to be one or more interesting

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.120 
going to be one or more interesting

well we're going to be hearing a lot of
new<00:06:58.819> technologies<00:06:59.539> over<00:06:59.990> the<00:07:00.110> next<00:07:00.410> couple<00:07:00.620> of

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
new technologies over the next couple of

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.400 
new technologies over the next couple of
months<00:07:01.220> I<00:07:01.520> think<00:07:01.580> and<00:07:02.060> of<00:07:02.990> course<00:07:03.050> we're

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 
hearing about virtual reality we're

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.600 
hearing about virtual reality we're
going<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:05.750> be<00:07:05.840> hearing<00:07:06.110> about<00:07:08.169> gorillas

going to be hearing about gorillas

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.279 
going to be hearing about gorillas
explanation<00:07:10.610> on<00:07:10.819> exactly<00:07:11.330> why<00:07:11.690> they<00:07:12.020> decided

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
explanation on exactly why they decided

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.999 
explanation on exactly why they decided
to<00:07:12.710> go<00:07:12.830> with<00:07:12.949> temporary<00:07:13.310> projection<00:07:14.180> and<00:07:15.050> in

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:16.009 
to go with temporary projection and in

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.850 
to go with temporary projection and in
Killzone<00:07:16.550> shadow<00:07:16.580> fall<00:07:17.050> much<00:07:18.050> more<00:07:18.410> as<00:07:18.650> well

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
Killzone shadow fall much more as well

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.930 
Killzone shadow fall much more as well
so<00:07:19.099> it's<00:07:19.220> going<00:07:19.310> to<00:07:19.370> be<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.490> very<00:07:19.639> interesting

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940
