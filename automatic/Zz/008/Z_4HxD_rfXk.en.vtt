 some words 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.860

 proposed technologies or products 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.549
 since the big difference compared to this type of aircraft 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.310
 you see here a330 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.310
 we are passing technologies 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.770

 the cqpm that we set up on assembling dial then for us 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.180
 it's something that has been put aside that's been putting in place of 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.730
 very responsive way with industrial partners such as with a 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.790
 hero and ratier figeac but mostly thanks to the support of the branch thanks 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 in support of the cfj and thanks to the support of peace that allowed us to put 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.540
 on sale in place this training the means available for this 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.500
 training in two ways very responsive since the cost of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.799

 can you accept less than a year 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.930
 the means put in place by the afp then in the case of the csi de 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.039
 beauzelle are for us a formidable we will be able to have personal 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.440

 support but also in terms of initial training alternating with the 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 cfa is sad it will allow us to face our challenge which is to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.050
 start the a350 on time and deal with aline ramp up 7 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.609
 1,350 that will be 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.519
 still relatively impressive record 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.770
