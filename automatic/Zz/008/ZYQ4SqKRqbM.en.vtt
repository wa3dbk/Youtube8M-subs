BMW R nineT:
Why does it cost 14.500 Euros?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Because many have asked about the price:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This here is what it looks like: cheap plastic...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
...but this is not what it looks like, the headlamp is made from steel.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
...but this is not what it looks like, the headlamp is made from steel.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here we have a steel badge, like on the old BMWs. It's just there because it's a nice detail, the bike has another badge for the law.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
All the silver covers are sheet aluminium.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
These are cast and forged aluminium, while the fenders themselves are made from thick plastic.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The tank is made from sheet aluminium, painted in "Black Soul Metallic" (a metalflake black) with brushed sides under clear lacquer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Here is a cast and forged aluminium part holding the seat, note the nice milled screw washer.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The back seat cover hump thingie is made from sheet aluminium (holds some storage, like a first aid kit).

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:43.000
...and this ugly thing is only needed for a pillion rider. Without, you can remove it, freeing the backside of the bike. For the left side, there is an aluminium exhaust holder in the options list.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You can remove the number plate from up there. There are fixing points on the swingarm for mounting it down there, but you have to check with your authorities for legality. It's not homologated.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You can even remove the back completely for a bike that ends at the saddle.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This is not the standard seat. Like nearly everything on this particular bike, you have to pay extra for it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
...extra...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
...extra...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The cannonshot exhaust is stock, though...

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
...same as the golden front fork. It's a standard fork, because the Telelever is just not cool. Yes, even BMW admits it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We were riding it today, and not only is it the first cool BMW bike ever, but it also was a lot of fun, unexpectedly.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Unusually for BMW, the engine is meaty and loud.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But all that doesn't really matter, because the bike is sold out 'till September at least. You can muse about it until then.
