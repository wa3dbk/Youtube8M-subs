00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
right now but instead of being organized

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.809 
right now but instead of being organized
by<00:02:46.349> something<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:46.920> channels<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
by something like channels which is a

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.119 
by something like channels which is a
little<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.120> hard<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.440> understand<00:02:49.440> we've<00:02:49.950> done

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
little bit hard to understand we've done

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.740 
little bit hard to understand we've done
something<00:02:50.519> fairly<00:02:50.730> simple<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.239> organize<00:02:51.510> it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
something fairly simple and organize it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.349 
something fairly simple and organize it
by<00:02:51.780> genres<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.889> so<00:02:53.310> i<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.700> now<00:02:53.819> see<00:02:54.030> all<00:02:54.060> the

by genres like so i can now see all the

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.610 
by genres like so i can now see all the
different<00:02:54.420> movies<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.930> are<00:02:54.989> available<00:02:55.079> the

different movies that are available the
comedy<00:02:55.980> show<00:02:56.099> their<00:02:56.370> dramas<00:02:56.639> what<00:02:56.819> have<00:02:56.940> you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
comedy show their dramas what have you

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.869 
comedy show their dramas what have you
what's<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.409> interesting<00:02:58.560> i<00:02:58.889> think<00:02:58.920> beyond

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
what's more interesting i think beyond

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.229 
what's more interesting i think beyond
that<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.620> actually<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.970> all

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that is to really actually think of all

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.910 
that is to really actually think of all
the<00:03:03.480> different<00:03:03.780> content<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.319> build<00:03:04.799> an

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
the different content and build an

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.979 
the different content and build an
optimized<00:03:05.400> engine<00:03:06.000> for<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.329> user<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.870> how

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
optimized engine for the user on how

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
optimized engine for the user on how
they<00:03:07.139> can<00:03:07.170> find<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.519> user<00:03:08.670> chooses<00:03:08.970> to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
they can find it so if a user chooses to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.059 
they can find it so if a user chooses to
opt<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.049> actually<00:03:10.200> personalize<00:03:10.889> the

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
opt in we can actually personalize the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.069 
opt in we can actually personalize the
experience<00:03:11.099> completely<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.120> them<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:12.870> based

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
experience completely to them so based

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.629 
experience completely to them so based
off<00:03:13.260> what<00:03:13.409> you<00:03:13.440> watch<00:03:13.680> before<00:03:13.859> waist<00:03:14.340> up<00:03:14.519> what

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
off what you watch before waist up what

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.879 
off what you watch before waist up what
you<00:03:14.760> rated<00:03:15.180> based<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.870> what<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.019> tell<00:03:16.169> us<00:03:16.230> will

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
you rated based on what you tell us will

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.229 
you rated based on what you tell us will
actually<00:03:17.250> optimize<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.819> experience<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
actually optimize the experience and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.789 
actually optimize the experience and
show<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.449> only<00:03:18.720> content<00:03:19.139> is<00:03:19.230> relevant<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.620> you

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
so for me this is actually a list of

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.240 
so for me this is actually a list of
contents<00:03:22.139> criticized<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.069> would

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
contents criticized for me for you would

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.680 
contents criticized for me for you would
be<00:03:23.340> actually<00:03:23.669> a<00:03:23.699> different<00:03:24.000> set<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.419> content

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
be actually a different set of content

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.890 
be actually a different set of content
and<00:03:25.620> again<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.579> idea<00:03:26.879> here<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:27.750> can

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and again the idea here is that we can

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.080 
and again the idea here is that we can
let<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.169> user<00:03:28.349> focus<00:03:28.739> on<00:03:28.859> content<00:03:29.129> and<00:03:29.549> not

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
let the user focus on content and not

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.509 
let the user focus on content and not
where<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:30.840> coming<00:03:31.049> from<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.859> once<00:03:32.099> I<00:03:32.190> decided

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
where it's coming from so once I decided

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.189 
where it's coming from so once I decided
to<00:03:32.639> watch<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.910> movie<00:03:33.180> something<00:03:33.419> like<00:03:33.660> Scott

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
to watch a movie something like Scott

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.460

Pilgrim<00:03:35.190> vs.<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.669> world<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:36.269> can<00:03:36.930> then<00:03:37.109> decide

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
Pilgrim vs. the world I can then decide

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.809 
Pilgrim vs. the world I can then decide
where<00:03:37.769> they<00:03:37.859> want<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:38.040> watch<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.370> if<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.579> want<00:03:38.760> to
