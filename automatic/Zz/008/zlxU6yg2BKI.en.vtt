00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it can take a web at a time as you can

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
it can take a web at a time as you can
see<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.990> take<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.380> time<00:01:40.590> when<00:01:40.740> I'm

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
see I really do take my time when I'm

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.980 
see I really do take my time when I'm
doing<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.130> dots<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.909> want<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.630> really

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
doing my dots I want them to be really

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.660 
doing my dots I want them to be really
perfect<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:44.210> very<00:01:45.210> symmetrical<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.229> such<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
perfect and very symmetrical with such a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
perfect and very symmetrical with such a
easy<00:01:47.670> pattern<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
easy pattern to do but if you do it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.670 
easy pattern to do but if you do it
messy<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.149> effect<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.659> disappears<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
messy the effect just disappears so I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.060 
messy the effect just disappears so I
think<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> effect<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:55.070> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
think for the effect I'm going for it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.319 
think for the effect I'm going for it
was<00:01:56.189> important<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.790> actually<00:01:56.880> took<00:01:57.149> my

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
was important that I actually took my

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.700 
was important that I actually took my
time<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:57.990> made<00:01:58.170> sure<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
time and really made sure that the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.030 
time and really made sure that the
circles<00:01:59.130> were<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.549> symmetrical<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
circles were very symmetrical and in the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.020 
circles were very symmetrical and in the
perfect<00:02:02.399> position

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
perfect position

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.990 
perfect position
so<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.950> dotting<00:02:05.130> tool<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.579> has<00:02:05.759> two

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
so my dotting tool there has two

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
so my dotting tool there has two
different<00:02:06.479> ends<00:02:06.659> two<00:02:07.140> different<00:02:07.439> sizes<00:02:07.619> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
different ends two different sizes that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.699 
different ends two different sizes that
I've<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.190> swapped<00:02:08.429> over<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.410> put<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.530> dots

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I've just swapped over I put my dots

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.229 
I've just swapped over I put my dots
down<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> as<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> blue

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
down and as you can see that the blue

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.420 
down and as you can see that the blue
light<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.720> my

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
light there is my

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.880 
light there is my
LED<00:02:14.390> lights<00:02:14.689> I've<00:02:14.989> just<00:02:15.290> popped<00:02:15.530> them<00:02:15.739> in

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
LED lights I've just popped them in

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.729 
LED lights I've just popped them in
there<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.280> set<00:02:16.640> them<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.900> actually<00:02:18.140> took<00:02:18.469> 30

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
there to set them that actually took 30

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.160 
there to set them that actually took 30
seconds<00:02:19.189> brought<00:02:20.120> them<00:02:20.269> back<00:02:20.390> out<00:02:20.599> again<00:02:20.629> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
seconds brought them back out again and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.280 
seconds brought them back out again and
used<00:02:21.859> my<00:02:22.069> black<00:02:22.370> gel<00:02:22.700> paint<00:02:22.939> just<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.359> finish

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
used my black gel paint just to finish

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.630 
used my black gel paint just to finish
off<00:02:24.469> a<00:02:24.500> tiny<00:02:24.769> little<00:02:25.040> dot<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.430> middle

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
off a tiny little dot in the middle

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.830 
off a tiny little dot in the middle
there<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.819> think<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.060> looks<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:26.239> effective

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
there I think it looks really effective

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.209 
there I think it looks really effective
and<00:02:27.349> that's<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:27.739> I've<00:02:27.799> done<00:02:27.829> a<00:02:27.950> little<00:02:28.010> white

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
and that's what I've done a little white

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.380 
and that's what I've done a little white
one<00:02:28.400> there<00:02:28.579> but<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.790> had<00:02:28.939> actually<00:02:29.030> done<00:02:29.299> that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
one there but I had actually done that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.479 
one there but I had actually done that
yesterday<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:30.200> then<00:02:30.829> get<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> chance<00:02:31.099> to

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
yesterday and then get a chance to

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.300 
yesterday and then get a chance to
record<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.439> so<00:02:33.439> in<00:02:33.590> my<00:02:33.739> line<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.189> I'm

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
record it so in my line that I'm

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.459 
record it so in my line that I'm
striping<00:02:34.819> there<00:02:35.030> trust<00:02:35.750> me<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:35.989> was<00:02:36.109> not<00:02:36.290> that

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
striping there trust me it was not that

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.949 
striping there trust me it was not that
quick<00:02:36.709> I'm<00:02:36.889> very<00:02:37.310> anal<00:02:37.700> about<00:02:37.939> my<00:02:38.359> lines<00:02:38.629> being

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
quick I'm very anal about my lines being

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.259 
quick I'm very anal about my lines being
super<00:02:39.349> straight<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.829> take<00:02:40.189> away<00:02:40.430> while<00:02:40.609> so

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
super straight so to take away while so

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.530 
super straight so to take away while so
what<00:02:41.389> I<00:02:41.420> actually<00:02:41.540> do<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.219> when<00:02:43.219> I've<00:02:43.510> made<00:02:44.510> a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
what I actually do is when I've made a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.789 
what I actually do is when I've made a
portion<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.989> my<00:02:45.049> line<00:02:45.290> that's<00:02:45.470> nice<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
portion of my line that's nice and

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.110 
portion of my line that's nice and
straight<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.099> actually<00:02:46.370> set<00:02:46.639> it<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.879> does<00:02:47.030> it

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
straight it actually set it so does it

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.360 
straight it actually set it so does it
move<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.930> then<00:02:48.439> I<00:02:48.500> carry<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:48.889> and<00:02:49.010> finish<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
move and then I carry on and finish the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.890 
move and then I carry on and finish the
rest<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.639> the<00:02:49.700> line<00:02:49.909> so<00:02:50.599> here<00:02:50.780> I've<00:02:50.870> just

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
rest of the line so here I've just

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.679 
rest of the line so here I've just
popped<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.319> topcoat<00:02:51.500> onto<00:02:51.950> these<00:02:52.069> nails<00:02:52.689> and

technique<00:03:32.449> called<00:03:32.479> negative<00:03:33.290> space<00:03:33.739> and

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
technique called negative space and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.409 
technique called negative space and
negative<00:03:34.400> space<00:03:34.519> means<00:03:34.939> that<00:03:35.090> we<00:03:35.150> actually

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
negative space means that we actually

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.349 
negative space means that we actually
leave<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.780> portion<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.650> nail<00:03:36.829> unpainted<00:03:37.430> to
