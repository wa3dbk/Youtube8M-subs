need<00:00:49.519> those<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:50.059> do<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.329> electric<00:00:50.719> conversion

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
need those to do the electric conversion

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.450 
need those to do the electric conversion
for<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.190> motor<00:00:52.399> mount<00:00:57.969> that's<00:00:58.969> it<00:01:00.460> negative

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
for the motor mount that's it negative

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.520 
for the motor mount that's it negative
tracks<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:02.000> server<00:01:02.329> one<00:01:02.600> there<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:02.839> just<00:01:02.960> had<00:01:03.320> one

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
tracks a server one there I just had one

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.710 
tracks a server one there I just had one
so<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:04.100> was<00:01:04.220> better<00:01:04.430> than<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.700> HPI<00:01:05.090> but<00:01:05.450> still

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
so it was better than the HPI but still

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.140 
so it was better than the HPI but still
ain't<00:01:05.870> good<00:01:06.020> enough<00:01:09.280> that's<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.580> she's<00:01:10.880> pretty

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
ain't good enough that's it she's pretty

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.260 
ain't good enough that's it she's pretty
heavy<00:01:14.500> but<00:01:15.500> uh<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:16.430> on<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.850> running<00:01:17.120> I'll

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
heavy but uh it's on and running I'll

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.940 
heavy but uh it's on and running I'll
try<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.690> hold<00:01:18.410> my<00:01:18.710> phone<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.600> drive<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.740> one

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
try and hold my phone and drive with one

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.000 
try and hold my phone and drive with one
hand<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:22.580> I<00:01:22.670> can<00:01:22.760> we<00:01:23.030> see<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.420> go<00:01:23.800> it's<00:01:24.800> real

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
hand so I can we see it go it's real

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.270 
hand so I can we see it go it's real
Torquay<00:01:25.490> I'd<00:01:25.610> say<00:01:25.850> top<00:01:26.120> speed<00:01:26.480> is<00:01:26.660> maybe<00:01:27.280> 35

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
Torquay I'd say top speed is maybe 35

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.360 
Torquay I'd say top speed is maybe 35
which<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.970> didn't<00:01:29.270> want<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.510> to<00:01:29.540> do<00:01:29.780> 70<00:01:30.350> anyway

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:02:02.590 

I<00:01:59.860> had<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.890> hard<00:02:01.100> time<00:02:01.160> finding<00:02:01.580> any<00:02:01.880> videos<00:02:02.360> on

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
I had a hard time finding any videos on

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.010 
I had a hard time finding any videos on
how<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.870> convert<00:02:03.470> nobody<00:02:04.070> has<00:02:04.280> any<00:02:04.780> other<00:02:05.780> than

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
how to convert nobody has any other than

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.490 
how to convert nobody has any other than
foreign<00:02:06.410> countries<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.070> I'm<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.430> USA<00:02:08.000> so

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
foreign countries and I'm in the USA so

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.800 
foreign countries and I'm in the USA so
this<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.679> my<00:02:09.890> conversion<00:02:10.610> still<00:02:11.360> need<00:02:11.570> some

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
this is my conversion still need some

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.360 
this is my conversion still need some
work<00:02:11.840> not<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> hundred<00:02:12.500> percent<00:02:12.680> done<00:02:13.130> but

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
work not a hundred percent done but

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.000 
work not a hundred percent done but
that's<00:02:13.490> it<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.970> far
