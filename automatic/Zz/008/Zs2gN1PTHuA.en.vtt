there<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.500> gold<00:02:21.210> which<00:02:22.210> isn't<00:02:22.660> actually<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
there of gold which isn't actually the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410 
there of gold which isn't actually the
way<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.590> real<00:02:23.770> belt<00:02:24.010> was<00:02:24.160> along<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.390> along

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
way the real belt was along here along

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.809 
way the real belt was along here along
the<00:02:25.810> edges<00:02:26.140> these<00:02:26.800> were<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.190> silver<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
the edges these were all silver on the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.580 
the edges these were all silver on the
real<00:02:27.970> one<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.330> what<00:02:29.020> I'm<00:02:29.080> gonna<00:02:29.230> do<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.500> I'm

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
real one so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.100 
real one so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:02:29.650> modify<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.330> edges<00:02:31.990> on

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
gonna modify that so that the edges on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.710 
gonna modify that so that the edges on
them<00:02:32.230> are<00:02:32.350> silver<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> real<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.720> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
them are silver like the real one that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960 
them are silver like the real one that
combined<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.409> Reese<00:02:35.620> toning<00:02:35.980> I've<00:02:36.580> been

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
combined with the Reese toning I've been

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.930 
combined with the Reese toning I've been
thinking<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.510> having<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> plates<00:02:38.530> filled

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
thinking about having the plates filled

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.600 
thinking about having the plates filled
some<00:02:40.060> sort<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.360> metal<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:40.840> something<00:02:41.430> heat<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
some sort of metal or something heat it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.860 
some sort of metal or something heat it
down<00:02:42.760> pour<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.240> then<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.360> cool<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.750> off

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
down pour it in and then it cool it off

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.020 
down pour it in and then it cool it off
to<00:02:44.200> give<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.440> more<00:02:44.560> weight<00:02:44.770> but<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.760> more<00:02:46.000> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
to give it more weight but the more I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.000 
to give it more weight but the more I
think<00:02:46.120> about<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:47.140> spinner<00:02:47.410> itself<00:02:47.800> is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
think about it the spinner itself is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.370 
think about it the spinner itself is
pretty<00:02:48.820> unmanageable<00:02:49.570> with<00:02:49.840> hollow<00:02:50.050> plates

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
pretty unmanageable with hollow plates

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.540 
pretty unmanageable with hollow plates
so<00:02:50.560> filled<00:02:50.950> out<00:02:51.070> plates

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
so filled out plates

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.010 
so filled out plates
I'd<00:02:51.910> imagine<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.360> be<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.510> nightmare<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.990> I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
I'd imagine would be a nightmare so I

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.080 
I'd imagine would be a nightmare so I
might<00:02:53.260> skip<00:02:53.530> through<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:53.830> one<00:02:54.160> anyway<00:02:55.030> so

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
might skip through that one anyway so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.490 
might skip through that one anyway so
this<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.510> gonna<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> quick<00:02:56.110> overview

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
this is just gonna be a quick overview

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.610 
this is just gonna be a quick overview
of<00:02:56.890> what<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.820> looks<00:02:57.970> like<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.240> stowed<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.690> even

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
of what it looks like we stowed and even

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.200 
of what it looks like we stowed and even
though<00:02:59.830> I<00:03:00.100> know<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> lot<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.850> people<00:03:01.030> say<00:03:01.120> it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
though I know a lot of people say it

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.120 
though I know a lot of people say it
looks<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.420> same<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:02.380> really<00:03:02.920> doesn't

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
looks the same it really really doesn't

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.770 
looks the same it really really doesn't
I<00:03:03.340> mean<00:03:03.490> it<00:03:03.820> does<00:03:04.030> make<00:03:04.240> the<00:03:04.420> world<00:03:04.600> of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
I mean it does make the world of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.140 
I mean it does make the world of
difference<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.350> can<00:03:06.010> see<00:03:06.190> how<00:03:06.340> shiny<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.880> sort

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
difference you can see how shiny is sort

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.240 
difference you can see how shiny is sort
of<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.600> there<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.740> glistening<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
of just there the glistening on the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.270 
of just there the glistening on the
dough<00:03:09.340> dough<00:03:09.490> he<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:10.000> impressive

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
dough dough he is really impressive

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.730 
dough dough he is really impressive
before<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.370> looked<00:03:12.520> really<00:03:12.700> pale<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
before it looked really pale and the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.010 
before it looked really pale and the
stones<00:03:14.950> look<00:03:15.040> really<00:03:15.490> really<00:03:15.670> plastic

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
stones look really really plastic

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.090 
stones look really really plastic
because<00:03:17.020> felt<00:03:17.380> they<00:03:17.500> were<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.070> the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100

sparkle on it

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.300 
sparkle on it
and<00:03:21.960> I'm<00:03:22.960> not<00:03:23.320> even<00:03:23.380> getting<00:03:23.680> good<00:03:24.100> lighting

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
and I'm not even getting good lighting

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.310 
and I'm not even getting good lighting
on<00:03:24.460> this<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.880> sparkles<00:03:25.480> best<00:03:25.780> when<00:03:26.080> there's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
on this it sparkles best when there's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.630 
on this it sparkles best when there's
bugger-all<00:03:27.100> light<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.910> mean<00:03:28.620> when<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:30.010> wake<00:03:30.490> up

probably<00:04:45.370> what<00:04:45.520> most<00:04:45.730> people<00:04:46.090> regard<00:04:46.390> as<00:04:46.690> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
probably what most people regard as the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.020 
probably what most people regard as the
most<00:04:46.840> biggest<00:04:47.500> difference<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
most biggest difference is on the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.180 
most biggest difference is on the
replica<00:04:49.450> version<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.470> traditional<00:04:50.950> replica

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
replica version the traditional replica

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.920 
replica version the traditional replica
version<00:04:51.430> with<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.580> old<00:04:51.700> stones<00:04:51.940> all<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.810> these

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
version with the old stones all of these

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.930 
version with the old stones all of these
are<00:04:53.080> clear<00:04:53.350> like<00:04:53.560> these<00:04:53.740> ones<00:04:54.010> just<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.880> a

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
are clear like these ones just in a

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.850 
are clear like these ones just in a
circular<00:04:55.330> shape<00:04:55.510> whereas<00:04:56.410> on<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.590> real<00:04:56.740> one

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
circular shape whereas on the real one

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560 
circular shape whereas on the real one
they<00:04:56.980> were<00:04:57.070> sort<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.400> yellowy<00:04:57.730> gold<00:04:58.060> version

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
they were sort of a yellowy gold version

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:12.900 
they were sort of a yellowy gold version
like<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.850> very<00:05:00.940> nice<00:05:01.210> as<00:05:01.390> well

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.480 

looks<00:05:13.540> really<00:05:13.780> really<00:05:14.110> nice<00:05:14.260> when<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.070> do<00:05:15.190> have

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
looks really really nice when I do have

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.920 
looks really really nice when I do have
it<00:05:15.580> redone<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:16.030> don't<00:05:16.390> know<00:05:16.540> if<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.750> have<00:05:16.900> it

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
it redone I don't know if I have it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.200 
it redone I don't know if I have it
spinning<00:05:17.350> or<00:05:17.710> I'll<00:05:18.280> have<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.550> stationary

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
spinning or I'll have it stationary

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.170 
spinning or I'll have it stationary
my<00:05:19.870> gut<00:05:20.320> instinct<00:05:20.890> tells<00:05:21.250> me<00:05:21.490> I<00:05:21.520> will<00:05:21.880> probably

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
my gut instinct tells me I will probably

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.650 
my gut instinct tells me I will probably
have<00:05:22.660> it<00:05:22.780> stuck<00:05:23.050> in<00:05:23.170> the<00:05:23.230> middle<00:05:23.850> just<00:05:24.850> in<00:05:25.210> that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
have it stuck in the middle just in that

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.120 
have it stuck in the middle just in that
position<00:05:25.840> so<00:05:26.320> that<00:05:26.560> when<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.830> move<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.070> around

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
position so that when you move it around

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.500 
position so that when you move it around
you'll<00:05:28.090> catch<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:30.210> sparkle<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.240> little<00:05:31.330> bit

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
you'll catch the sparkle a little bit

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.210 
you'll catch the sparkle a little bit
better<00:05:33.390> yeah<00:05:34.950> again

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
better yeah again

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.780 
better yeah again
Swarovski<00:05:36.760> crystals<00:05:37.420> all<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:37.570> way<00:05:37.660> around

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
Swarovski crystals all the way around

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.920 
Swarovski crystals all the way around
apparently<00:05:39.790> this<00:05:39.910> took<00:05:40.090> two<00:05:40.330> months<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.780> do

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
apparently this took two months to do

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:53.150 
apparently this took two months to do
which<00:05:41.140> doesn't<00:05:41.530> surprise<00:05:41.620> me

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.960

there again you got silver paint in the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.250 
there again you got silver paint in the
background<00:05:58.250> with<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.400> tiny<00:05:59.850> tiny<00:06:00.420> tiny<00:06:00.600> wings

but wing stones but the emerald stones

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:22.370 
but wing stones but the emerald stones
there<00:06:06.930> for<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:07.920> leaves<00:06:08.900> have<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.050> other<00:06:10.170> side

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.860 

and<00:06:22.560> honestly<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.730> best<00:06:23.910> part<00:06:24.060> about<00:06:24.240> this<00:06:24.540> is

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
and honestly the best part about this is

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.470 
and honestly the best part about this is
you<00:06:25.310> aren't<00:06:26.310> even<00:06:26.400> getting<00:06:26.610> accurately<00:06:27.270> you

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
you aren't even getting accurately you

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.940 
you aren't even getting accurately you
aren't<00:06:27.690> even<00:06:27.780> getting<00:06:28.080> an<00:06:28.170> accurate<00:06:28.350> picture

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
aren't even getting an accurate picture

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.610 
aren't even getting an accurate picture
of<00:06:28.980> what<00:06:29.580> the<00:06:30.080> shine<00:06:31.080> on<00:06:31.110> these<00:06:31.380> stones

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
of what the shine on these stones

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.770 
of what the shine on these stones
actually<00:06:31.860> looks<00:06:32.280> like<00:06:32.460> I've<00:06:33.360> sent<00:06:33.600> out<00:06:33.660> a

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
actually looks like I've sent out a

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.030 
actually looks like I've sent out a
couple<00:06:33.990> of<00:06:34.110> pictures<00:06:34.410> on<00:06:34.530> Twitter<00:06:34.710> that
