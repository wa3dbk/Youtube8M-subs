00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
extra sunshine the old shower could crop

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.710 
extra sunshine the old shower could crop
up<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> whole<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.509> be

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
up I think on the whole it's gonna be

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
up I think on the whole it's gonna be
another<00:01:40.170> dry<00:01:40.560> day<00:01:40.590> maybe<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.790> odd<00:01:41.880> bit

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
another dry day maybe just the odd bit

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
another dry day maybe just the odd bit
of<00:01:42.210> drizzle<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.259> those

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
of drizzle here and there so those

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.950 
of drizzle here and there so those
temperatures<00:01:43.860> again<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> 19<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.540> 20

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
temperatures again up to 19 or 20

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
