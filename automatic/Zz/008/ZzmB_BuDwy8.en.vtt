00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.129

 two 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.519
 with respect to single digits 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.239
 after the fiasco to release a film that involves one of the 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.269
 bigger movie studios with the world of video games I'm 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.189
 speaking of the prince of persia the sands of time the lovers of 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.050
 movies look quite promising in visual matter 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.250
 but it will be that the story sticks to the famous game of the 80s if you do not know 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.850
 what am I talking about erc and the story of the prince of persia the video game is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.640
 is about a whole saga that started in 1987 created by jordan mechner and that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.329
 achieved success thanks to the fluidity of the movement that managed to give 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.739
 protagonist implements an advance in animation of video games that 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.390
 then I simply demanded the original game was composed of a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.790
 trilogy the first installment is named Prince of Persia thrown 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.450
 originally for the pc and later adapted to the other consoles and to lama 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 where the ictu prince as a player had only one hour of time 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.130
 real to rescue the princess of the evil one visit spain the second 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 launch was in 1994 and is named after prince of persia the boss 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.500
 desired amezcua inc where should you face new building just that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.530
 this time this has gone through the beginning is to put everyone in his 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.600
 against so at the end of the game the prince will have to face his 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.300
 own shadow and therefore the title of the glimpse that was only released for the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.730
 13 on my fingers super nintendo lime 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.130
 then went to market to win despite the fact that the think tank was actually a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 complete failure because of his bad controls so he is considered the prince of 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.990
 persia the sands of time as the real event foreign exchange agents to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.630
 which keeps the essence of it but everything else is more 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.550
 of vido will change from producers a set is just this title on which they are based 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.310
 present the film starring chris wingert with the prince the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 bicicletero focuses on whether they will be the only ones in the world of cinema 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.090
 many times 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.370
 that they will be able thanks to their amulets we will return of the normality but the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.720
 history does not end here in the game if in schools with prince of persia 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.450
 the soul of the warrior 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.000
 prince of persia the two crowns and the game that has just premiered mention 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.980

 and is temporarily located between the sands of time and the soul of the warrior 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.780
 so now you know that the new movie is not just an idea 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.780
 innovative of disney china studies that has a whole history within the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.690
 world of video games and for this very reason it is said that this franchise 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.260
 could last at least six films like that who carry badly made or 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.019
 not with video games before having it civil
