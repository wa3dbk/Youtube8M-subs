away<00:00:37.690> from<00:00:37.809> wireless<00:00:38.649> for<00:00:38.890> a<00:00:38.920> variety<00:00:39.129> of

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
away from wireless for a variety of

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.079 
away from wireless for a variety of
reasons<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:41.379> FCC<00:00:41.949> rules<00:00:42.280> have<00:00:42.609> become<00:00:42.879> very

reasons the FCC rules have become very

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.029 
reasons the FCC rules have become very
confusing<00:00:43.660> about<00:00:43.899> what<00:00:44.170> frequencies<00:00:44.739> can<00:00:44.949> be

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
confusing about what frequencies can be

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
what aren't available if you're a

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.880 
what aren't available if you're a
touring<00:00:49.629> musician<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:50.469> go<00:00:50.620> overseas

touring musician and you go overseas

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.919 
touring musician and you go overseas
there's<00:00:51.550> some<00:00:51.760> frequencies<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.629> have

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
there's some frequencies that you have

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.720 
there's some frequencies that you have

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.160 
to have a special license for to use
overseas<00:00:55.329> so<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.469> real<00:00:56.649> headache<00:00:57.089> to<00:00:58.170> set

with typical analog FM based wireless

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.310 
with typical analog FM based wireless
systems<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.909> there's<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.659> circuit<00:01:11.170> that's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
systems is there's a circuit that's

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.230 
systems is there's a circuit that's
inside<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.920> wireless<00:01:12.340> system<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:12.880> helps<00:01:13.149> it

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
inside the wireless system that helps it

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.980 
inside the wireless system that helps it
operate<00:01:13.810> quietly<00:01:14.729> called<00:01:15.729> companion<00:01:16.420> and

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
operate quietly called companion and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.899 
operate quietly called companion and
it's<00:01:17.140> sort<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.590> an<00:01:17.710> oversimplification<00:01:18.130> but

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
it's sort of an oversimplification but

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.870 
it's sort of an oversimplification but
basically<00:01:19.390> your<00:01:19.990> signal<00:01:20.469> at<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:21.189> transmitter

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
basically your signal at the transmitter

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.660 
basically your signal at the transmitter
is<00:01:22.170> compressed<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.469> squeezed<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.460> fit

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
is compressed and squeezed to fit

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.420 
is compressed and squeezed to fit
through<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:25.000> very<00:01:25.329> small<00:01:25.719> audio<00:01:26.320> pipes<00:01:26.740> up<00:01:27.159> so

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
through a very small audio pipes up so

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.520 
through a very small audio pipes up so
to<00:01:27.490> speak<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.000> then<00:01:28.420> it's<00:01:28.570> expanded<00:01:29.200> again<00:01:29.320> at

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
to speak and then it's expanded again at

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.160 
to speak and then it's expanded again at
the<00:01:29.649> other<00:01:29.770> end<00:01:30.040> what<00:01:30.640> happens<00:01:31.119> with<00:01:31.360> your

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
the other end what happens with your

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.410 
the other end what happens with your
instrument<00:01:33.009> when<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:33.640> play<00:01:33.909> through<00:01:34.360> a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
instrument when you play through a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.870 
instrument when you play through a
wireless<00:01:34.840> system<00:01:35.049> like<00:01:35.409> that<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.250> squashes

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
wireless system like that is it squashes

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.609 
wireless system like that is it squashes
and<00:01:37.060> takes<00:01:37.299> all<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.630> dynamics<00:01:38.229> out<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.500> your

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
and takes all the dynamics out of your

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.980 
and takes all the dynamics out of your
sound<00:01:38.950> so<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.700> lose<00:01:39.939> all<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.180> sparkle<00:01:40.960> and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
sound so you lose all the sparkle and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.109 
sound so you lose all the sparkle and
the<00:01:41.110> clarity<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:41.920> all<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.189> nuances<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.939> the

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
the clarity and all the nuances of the

the clarity and all the nuances of the
instrument<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.289> work<00:01:44.469> so<00:01:44.680> hard<00:01:44.710> to

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
instrument that you work so hard to

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.060 
instrument that you work so hard to
develop<00:01:46.109> if<00:01:47.109> you're<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> five<00:01:47.649> string<00:01:47.890> bass

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
develop if you're a five string bass

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.609 
develop if you're a five string bass
player<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.759> know<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.719> kiss<00:01:49.990> your<00:01:50.170> low<00:01:50.380> B

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.709 
player you know you can kiss your low B
string<00:01:50.649> goodbye<00:01:51.159> because<00:01:51.549> it'll<00:01:51.850> just<00:01:51.880> get

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
string goodbye because it'll just get

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.620 
string goodbye because it'll just get
low<00:01:52.960> B<00:01:53.170> just<00:01:53.409> becomes<00:01:53.770> fluff<00:01:54.189> because<00:01:54.759> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
low B just becomes fluff because the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.840 
low B just becomes fluff because the
frequency<00:01:56.259> response<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.039> typical<00:01:57.340> wireless

frequency response of a typical wireless

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.840 
frequency response of a typical wireless
system<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.600> compromised<00:01:59.490> because<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.700> this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
system is so compromised because of this

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.209 
system is so compromised because of this
squashing<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:01.689> goes<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:02.109> so<00:02:02.409> our<00:02:02.979> new

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
squashing that goes on so our new

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.149 
squashing that goes on so our new
digital<00:02:03.700> wireless<00:02:04.329> systems<00:02:04.770> don't<00:02:05.770> have<00:02:05.950> that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
digital wireless systems don't have that

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.310 
digital wireless systems don't have that
problem<00:02:06.369> for<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:07.060> couple<00:02:07.450> of<00:02:07.479> reasons<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:07.990> first

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
problem for a couple of reasons so first

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.880 
problem for a couple of reasons so first
of<00:02:08.470> all<00:02:08.560> we'll<00:02:08.740> talk<00:02:08.920> about<00:02:09.100> our<00:02:09.580> G<00:02:10.390> 30

the<00:04:18.250> world<00:04:18.460> in<00:04:18.970> addition<00:04:19.420> to<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.750> we<00:04:20.350> also

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
the world in addition to that we also

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.380 
the world in addition to that we also
have<00:04:20.860> a<00:04:20.890> feature<00:04:21.160> built<00:04:21.580> into<00:04:21.790> our<00:04:21.880> wireless

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
have a feature built into our wireless

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.810 
have a feature built into our wireless
systems<00:04:22.780> called<00:04:23.080> cable<00:04:23.500> tone<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:24.670> you're

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
systems called cable tone so if you're

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.610 
systems called cable tone so if you're
used<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.120> listening<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.720> your<00:04:25.930> guitar<00:04:26.260> rig

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
used to listening to your guitar rig

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.070 
used to listening to your guitar rig
through<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.250> pedal<00:04:27.640> board<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.300> 25<00:04:28.810> foot

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
through a pedal board and a 25 foot

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.620 
through a pedal board and a 25 foot
cable<00:04:29.350> those<00:04:30.280> long<00:04:30.520> cables<00:04:31.000> can<00:04:31.180> affect<00:04:31.480> your

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
cable those long cables can affect your

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.330 
cable those long cables can affect your
sound<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.410> lose<00:04:32.650> some<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:32.920> that<00:04:33.100> high-end

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
sound and you lose some of that high-end

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.150 
sound and you lose some of that high-end
well<00:04:33.910> some<00:04:34.180> people<00:04:34.330> build<00:04:34.720> their<00:04:34.990> entire<00:04:35.320> rig

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
well some people build their entire rig

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.380 
well some people build their entire rig
based<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.420> sound<00:04:37.900> so<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.980> digital

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
based on that sound so the digital

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.910 
based on that sound so the digital
quality<00:04:40.390> of<00:04:40.690> our<00:04:40.840> systems<00:04:41.350> completely

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
quality of our systems completely

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.490 
quality of our systems completely
eliminates<00:04:42.460> all<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.910> high-end<00:04:43.420> loss<00:04:43.840> but

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
eliminates all that high-end loss but

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.110 
eliminates all that high-end loss but
for<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> people<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.160> want<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.640> put<00:04:45.880> some<00:04:46.090> of

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
for the people that want to put some of

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.090 
for the people that want to put some of
that<00:04:46.330> cable<00:04:46.600> sound<00:04:47.020> back<00:04:47.260> into<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:47.770> we<00:04:47.890> have<00:04:48.070> a

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
that cable sound back into it we have a

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.770 
that cable sound back into it we have a
thing<00:04:48.370> called<00:04:48.400> cable<00:04:48.820> tone<00:04:49.150> built<00:04:49.480> into<00:04:49.690> the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
thing called cable tone built into the

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.260 
thing called cable tone built into the
receivers<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.920> I'm<00:04:51.070> going<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.280> put<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.490> 30-foot

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
receivers so I'm going to put a 30-foot

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.900 
receivers so I'm going to put a 30-foot
guitar<00:04:52.630> cable<00:04:53.020> on<00:04:53.140> this<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:53.890> we'll<00:04:54.730> do<00:04:54.880> a

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
guitar cable on this and and we'll do a

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.630 
guitar cable on this and and we'll do a
little<00:04:55.180> playing<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.600> listening<00:04:56.250> okay<00:04:57.250> so<00:04:57.310> now

body-pack transmitter to the receiver

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.490 
body-pack transmitter to the receiver
and<00:05:03.520> we're<00:05:03.820> going<00:05:04.030> into<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.300> line<00:05:04.540> six<00:05:04.840> l3t

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
and we're going into a line six l3t

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.390 
and we're going into a line six l3t
loudspeaker<00:05:06.190> and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.320

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
so all the clarity all finger noise and

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.140 
so all the clarity all finger noise and
everything<00:05:22.139> just<00:05:22.319> comes<00:05:22.620> out

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
everything just comes out

your guitar player likes to turn your

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:45.540 
your guitar player likes to turn your
volume<00:05:44.020> down<00:05:44.259> and<00:05:44.710> use<00:05:45.099> that<00:05:45.279> as<00:05:45.430> some

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
volume down and use that as some

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.059 
volume down and use that as some
dynamics<00:05:46.240> with<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.080> typical<00:05:47.439> wireless<00:05:47.740> system

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
dynamics with a typical wireless system

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.040 
dynamics with a typical wireless system
when<00:05:48.159> you<00:05:48.249> turn<00:05:48.460> your<00:05:48.580> guitar<00:05:48.939> down<00:05:49.180> you<00:05:49.779> start

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
when you turn your guitar down you start

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.659 
when you turn your guitar down you start
to<00:05:50.110> get<00:05:50.229> a<00:05:50.259> pumping<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:50.860> squashing<00:05:51.399> sound

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
to get a pumping and squashing sound

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.399 
to get a pumping and squashing sound
doesn't<00:05:52.330> happen<00:05:52.479> here<00:05:52.839> because<00:05:53.110> we're<00:05:53.289> not

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
doesn't happen here because we're not

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.589 
doesn't happen here because we're not
using<00:05:53.589> a<00:05:53.830> commander<00:05:54.399> it's<00:05:54.550> just<00:05:54.789> crystal

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
using a commander it's just crystal

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.959 
using a commander it's just crystal
clear

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:04.889 

so<00:05:58.569> if<00:05:58.659> I<00:05:58.749> bring<00:05:58.929> the<00:05:59.080> guitar<00:05:59.169> down<00:06:03.719> pay<00:06:04.719> very

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:04.899 
so if I bring the guitar down pay very

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.450 
so if I bring the guitar down pay very

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.820 
30 about 300 feet with the G 50 and we
do<00:06:25.940> have<00:06:26.090> a<00:06:26.150> Jean<00:06:26.420> 90<00:06:26.810> system<00:06:27.290> which<00:06:27.470> is<00:06:27.680> the

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
do have a Jean 90 system which is the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.350 
do have a Jean 90 system which is the
rackmount<00:06:28.160> version<00:06:28.610> of<00:06:28.700> the<00:06:28.790> receiver<00:06:29.090> if

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
rackmount version of the receiver if

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.760 
rackmount version of the receiver if
that's<00:06:29.570> where<00:06:29.780> you<00:06:29.900> like<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.170> keep<00:06:30.320> your<00:06:30.530> stuff

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
that's where you like to keep your stuff

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.680 
that's where you like to keep your stuff
but<00:06:31.370> these<00:06:31.550> are<00:06:31.700> really<00:06:32.060> nice<00:06:32.210> because

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
but these are really nice because

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.510 
but these are really nice because
they're<00:06:32.900> just<00:06:33.050> a<00:06:33.230> pedal<00:06:33.560> board<00:06:33.770> based

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
they're just a pedal board based

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.070 
they're just a pedal board based
receiver<00:06:35.000> so<00:06:35.270> it<00:06:35.300> can<00:06:35.480> go<00:06:35.630> right<00:06:35.780> on<00:06:35.960> your

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
receiver so it can go right on your

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.070 
receiver so it can go right on your
pedal<00:06:36.410> board<00:06:36.440> with<00:06:36.770> your<00:06:36.890> other<00:06:37.040> stompboxes

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
pedal board with your other stompboxes

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.290 
pedal board with your other stompboxes
so<00:06:39.080> that's<00:06:39.320> the<00:06:39.500> line<00:06:39.680> six<00:06:40.010> relay<00:06:40.490> Wireless

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
so that's the line six relay Wireless

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.390 
so that's the line six relay Wireless
instrument<00:06:41.810> system<00:06:42.230> come<00:06:42.950> on<00:06:43.070> down<00:06:43.280> to
