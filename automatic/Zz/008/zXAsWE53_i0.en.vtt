00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.790 
makeup and the art of drag you you see
this<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.160> other<00:04:36.820> for<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.570> while<00:04:37.800> before

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
this is a other for a while before

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.990 
this is a other for a while before
actors<00:04:39.790> were<00:04:40.300> always<00:04:41.050> men<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.190> when<00:04:42.639> they<00:04:42.820> had

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
actors were always men and when they had

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.719 
actors were always men and when they had
to<00:04:43.180> play<00:04:43.710> women<00:04:44.880> they<00:04:45.880> had<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.120> do<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.389> in<00:04:47.350> drag

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
to play women they had to do it in drag

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.350 
to play women they had to do it in drag
so<00:04:48.729> this<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.120> very<00:04:49.419> old<00:04:50.639> way<00:04:51.639> of<00:04:51.850> expression

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
so this is a very old way of expression

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.670 
so this is a very old way of expression
and<00:04:53.910> that's<00:04:54.910> what<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.150> wanna<00:04:55.389> show<00:04:56.139> with<00:04:56.500> this
