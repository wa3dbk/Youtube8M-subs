00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.779

to get that last degree was something

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310 
to get that last degree was something
that<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.000> always<00:00:27.090> dreamed<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.900> doing

that I always dreamed of doing

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.640 
that I always dreamed of doing
but<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> couldn't<00:00:29.990> coordinate<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.380> my

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
but I couldn't coordinate that with my

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.510 
but I couldn't coordinate that with my
my<00:00:31.980> life

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
my life

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.189 
my life
so<00:00:32.699> when<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.879> heard<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.239> Athabasca

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
so when I heard about Athabasca

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.680 
so when I heard about Athabasca
part-time<00:00:34.800> doctorate<00:00:35.520> program<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.449> very

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
part-time doctorate program I was very

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
part-time doctorate program I was very
interested<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.530> then<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.949> heard<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
interested and then when I heard that it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
interested and then when I heard that it
was<00:00:38.520> an<00:00:39.210> open<00:00:39.510> university<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.559> distance

was an open university for distance

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
was an open university for distance
education<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.670> thought<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.239> perfect

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
education I thought that was perfect

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
education I thought that was perfect
because<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.170> didn't<00:00:43.530> even<00:00:43.739> feel<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.220> I<00:00:44.250> had

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
because I didn't even feel that I had

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
because I didn't even feel that I had
the<00:00:44.579> time<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.269> go<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.690> campus<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.829> the

the time to go to a campus actually the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
the time to go to a campus actually the
DBA<00:00:47.460> program<00:00:48.170> kind<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.350> natural

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
DBA program kind of a natural

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
DBA program kind of a natural
progression<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.579> me<00:00:50.640> I've<00:00:51.059> been<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> long<00:00:51.720> time

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
progression for me I've been a long time

notice we move a lot and sometimes the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.760 
notice we move a lot and sometimes the

intensity of the work flow is such that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
intensity of the work flow is such that

administration<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.040> having<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.640> DBA

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
administration I think having a DBA

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.179 
administration I think having a DBA
especially<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.350> instructor<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
especially as an instructor at a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.819 
especially as an instructor at a
post-secondary<00:01:35.579> institution<00:01:36.650> gives<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
post-secondary institution gives you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.910 
post-secondary institution gives you
that<00:01:38.040> knowledge<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.450> foundation<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that knowledge and foundation that you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
that knowledge and foundation that you
might<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.310> without<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.899> naturally

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
might not have without it so I naturally

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.219 
might not have without it so I naturally
now<00:01:44.250> even<00:01:44.790> after<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.360> year<00:01:45.689> sort<00:01:46.110> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
now even after one year sort of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.649 
now even after one year sort of
understand<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.799> lot<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> theories<00:01:47.610> behind

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
understand a lot of the theories behind

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
understand a lot of the theories behind
some<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> areas<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.320> M<00:01:49.439> studying<00:01:49.890> whereas

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
some of the areas of M studying whereas

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.670 
some of the areas of M studying whereas
before<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.509> didn't<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.020> sort<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
before I just didn't have that sort of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
before I just didn't have that sort of
general<00:01:53.159> understanding<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
general understanding so I think it

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
general understanding so I think it
makes<00:01:54.930> me<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> better<00:01:55.290> instructor<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
makes me a better instructor the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.219 
makes me a better instructor the
interesting<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
interesting thing is that the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770

program I was a little bit nervous about
learning<00:04:02.709> through<00:04:02.979> an<00:04:03.129> online<00:04:03.340> environment

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
learning through an online environment

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.180 
learning through an online environment

was all in the classroom and my

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.170 
was all in the classroom and my
perception<00:04:08.769> was<00:04:09.069> that's<00:04:09.310> how<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.519> learned<00:04:09.879> and
