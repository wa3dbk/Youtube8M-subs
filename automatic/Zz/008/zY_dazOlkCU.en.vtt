00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
having a look at the scar-h SV which has

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.620 
having a look at the scar-h SV which has
been<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:14.070> most<00:00:14.309> requested<00:00:14.519> weapon<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.599> I

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
been my most requested weapon so I

been my most requested weapon so I
thought<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.020> probably<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.680> time<00:00:16.949> that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
thought it was probably about time that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070 
thought it was probably about time that
I<00:00:17.250> gave<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> look<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:18.270> over<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> last<00:00:18.869> few

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
significantly buffed the DMR's in the

that<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.380> only<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.890> easier<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.490> hit<00:00:26.640> your

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that not only is it easier to hit your

that not only is it easier to hit your

previous<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.410> patch<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.890> probably<00:00:32.099> would

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
previous to this patch I probably would

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
previous to this patch I probably would
have<00:00:32.460> suggested<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.120> everyone<00:00:33.660> leaved<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
have suggested that everyone leaved the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930 
have suggested that everyone leaved the
sky<00:00:34.260> hate<00:00:34.530> swell<00:00:34.800> alone<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.820> was

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
sky hate swell alone because it was

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
sky hate swell alone because it was
frustrating<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.350> least<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
frustrating to use at the very least the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
frustrating to use at the very least the
scar-h<00:00:38.489> assault<00:00:39.000> rifle<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> assault

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
scar-h assault rifle in the assault

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
scar-h assault rifle in the assault
class<00:00:40.140> fired<00:00:40.620> quicker<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.280> killed<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
class fired quicker and killed in the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.459 
class fired quicker and killed in the
same<00:00:41.910> number<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> bullets<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.320> really

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
same number of bullets so there really

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
same number of bullets so there really
wasn't<00:00:43.710> any<00:00:44.010> reason<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> SV<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
wasn't any reason to use the SV so the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
wasn't any reason to use the SV so the
question<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.829> scar-h<00:00:47.100> still

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
question is is the scar-h still

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.600 
question is is the scar-h still
frustrating<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.480> now<00:00:48.690> well<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.890> sure

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
frustrating to use now well kind of sure

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
frustrating to use now well kind of sure
the<00:00:50.850> patch<00:00:51.030> has<00:00:51.059> made<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.750> better<00:00:51.930> but

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the patch has made it a lot better but

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
the patch has made it a lot better but
it's<00:00:52.649> still<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> my<00:00:53.399> favorite<00:00:53.820> DMR's

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it's still not one of my favorite DMR's

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
it's still not one of my favorite DMR's
I<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> guys<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> fondness<00:00:55.920> for

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
I know a lot of guys have a fondness for

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.470 
I know a lot of guys have a fondness for
this<00:00:56.309> weapon<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.910> much<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.090> everyone

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
this weapon but as much as everyone

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
this weapon but as much as everyone
recommends<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> gun<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> me<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.190> can't

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
recommends this gun to me I just can't

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.830 
recommends this gun to me I just can't
find<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.730> situation<00:00:59.940> where<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
find a situation where it can be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
find a situation where it can be
effective<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.890> look<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> stats

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
effective when you look at the stats

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 
effective when you look at the stats
it's<00:01:02.789> pretty<00:01:03.030> easy<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.629> why<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.470> scar-h

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it's pretty easy to see why the scar-h

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
it's pretty easy to see why the scar-h
does<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> few<00:01:05.700> decent<00:01:06.119> stats

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
does have a few decent stats

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
does have a few decent stats
specifically<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.560> super<00:01:07.890> quick<00:01:08.040> reload

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
specifically it's super quick reload

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.330 
specifically it's super quick reload
time<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> 2.3<00:01:09.390> seconds<00:01:09.900> empty<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> 1.85

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
time of 2.3 seconds empty and 1.85

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
time of 2.3 seconds empty and 1.85
seconds<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> bullet<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> chamber

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
seconds with a bullet in the chamber

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
seconds with a bullet in the chamber
it's<00:01:13.290> also<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> most<00:01:14.070> accurate<00:01:14.369> DMR's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's also one of the most accurate DMR's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.710 
it's also one of the most accurate DMR's
with<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.479> ATS<00:01:15.869> spread<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.490> 0.05<00:01:17.490> its<00:01:18.360> biggest

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
with an ATS spread of 0.05 its biggest

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
with an ATS spread of 0.05 its biggest
drawback<00:01:19.049> though<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> has<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> very

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
drawback though is that it has a very

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520 
drawback though is that it has a very
low<00:01:20.520> muzzle<00:01:20.790> velocity<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> 500<00:01:22.110> meters<00:01:22.380> per

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
low muzzle velocity of 500 meters per

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.020 
low muzzle velocity of 500 meters per
second<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.220> means<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> be

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
second this means that it's going to be

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
second this means that it's going to be
a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.270> harder<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.750> hit<00:01:24.900> moving<00:01:25.049> targets<00:01:25.259> at

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
a lot harder to hit moving targets at

39<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> only<00:02:33.560> thing<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.830> really<00:02:33.980> sets

39 and the only thing that really sets

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.010 
39 and the only thing that really sets
these<00:02:34.550> guns<00:02:34.790> apart<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.690> muzzle<00:02:35.870> velocity

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
these guns apart is the muzzle velocity

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.320 
these guns apart is the muzzle velocity

the slower muzzle velocity basically

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.060 
the slower muzzle velocity basically
gives<00:02:38.540> your<00:02:38.660> target<00:02:39.080> an<00:02:39.200> extra<00:02:39.530> little<00:02:39.800> window

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
gives your target an extra little window

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.710 
gives your target an extra little window
