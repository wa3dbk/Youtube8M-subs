just<00:02:03.090> tell<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.560> weighs<00:02:04.560> probably<00:02:04.829> twice<00:02:05.729> as

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
just tell this weighs probably twice as

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
just tell this weighs probably twice as
much<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> last<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
much as this and then the last one is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.900 
much as this and then the last one is
Model<00:02:09.170> Magic<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> closer<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.190> play-doh

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
Model Magic which is closer to play-doh

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.180 
Model Magic which is closer to play-doh
to<00:02:12.090> me

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
to me

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.510 
to me
but<00:02:13.340> look<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:14.000> kind<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.330> breaks<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
but look it kind of breaks like the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.450 
but look it kind of breaks like the
mundo<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.900> got<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.710> something<00:02:19.100> here

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
mundo so I got to do something here

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.030 
mundo so I got to do something here
just<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.330> curiosity<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:21.440> gonna<00:02:21.590> take<00:02:21.830> some

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
just for curiosity I'm gonna take some

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.420 
just for curiosity I'm gonna take some
of<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:22.630> mundo<00:02:23.800> I'm<00:02:24.800> gonna<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.070> equal<00:02:25.400> parts

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
of this mundo I'm gonna do equal parts

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.310 
of this mundo I'm gonna do equal parts
and<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:26.510> gonna<00:02:26.630> mix<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.080> with<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.920> play-doh

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
and I'm gonna mix it with the play-doh

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.440 
and I'm gonna mix it with the play-doh
something<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.440> me<00:02:30.560> wants<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:30.950> do<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
something in me wants to just do that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.150 
something in me wants to just do that
see<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.630> even<00:02:32.780> mixes<00:02:33.200> together<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.810> does

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
see if it even mixes together it does

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
see if it even mixes together it does
but<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.280> makes<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.550> very<00:02:40.610> chalky<00:02:42.100> see<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.310> so

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
but it makes it very chalky see that so

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.500 
but it makes it very chalky see that so
those<00:02:44.810> two<00:02:45.080> do<00:02:45.320> not<00:02:45.350> mix<00:02:45.820> very<00:02:46.820> well<00:02:46.910> let<00:02:47.420> me

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
those two do not mix very well let me

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.770 
those two do not mix very well let me
just<00:02:47.720> see<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:48.710> I<00:02:48.860> can<00:02:48.890> keep<00:02:49.580> working<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.090> it

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
just see if I can keep working it it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.060 
just see if I can keep working it it
almost<00:02:50.960> feels<00:02:51.200> like<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.500> needs<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.770> little<00:02:51.890> bit

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
almost feels like it needs a little bit

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.470 
almost feels like it needs a little bit
more<00:02:52.780> dough<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.150> see<00:02:56.360> if

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
more dough to it I just want to see if

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.440 
more dough to it I just want to see if
it's<00:02:56.660> closer<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.050> model<00:02:57.440> magic<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.010> way<00:03:01.450> all

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
it's closer to model magic that way all

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.200 
it's closer to model magic that way all
right<00:03:02.630> check<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.080> out

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
right check that out

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.140 
right check that out
so<00:03:05.210> yeah<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.870> still<00:03:06.170> kind<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.560> chalky<00:03:07.490> those

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
so yeah it's still kind of chalky those

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.970 
so yeah it's still kind of chalky those
two<00:03:08.450> don't<00:03:08.660> mix<00:03:08.870> well<00:03:09.140> together<00:03:12.880> all<00:03:13.880> right<00:03:14.980> so

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
two don't mix well together all right so

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.050 
two don't mix well together all right so
this<00:03:16.100> would<00:03:16.280> be<00:03:16.460> an<00:03:16.900> eyeball<00:03:17.950> combination<00:03:19.060> so

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
this would be an eyeball combination so

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.240 
this would be an eyeball combination so
how<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.270> they<00:03:20.450> get<00:03:20.630> mad<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.140> model<00:03:21.560> magic<00:03:22.070> it's

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
how do they get mad a model magic it's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.420 
how do they get mad a model magic it's
so<00:03:22.630> cross<00:03:23.630> between<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.200> two<00:03:24.620> let<00:03:25.160> me<00:03:25.280> just

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
so cross between the two let me just

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.670 
so cross between the two let me just
shape<00:03:25.700> something<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.239> each<00:03:26.390> one<00:03:26.630> Kenna<00:03:26.989> now<00:03:27.620> we

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
shape something on each one Kenna now we

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.170 
shape something on each one Kenna now we
all<00:03:27.890> know<00:03:28.040> play-doh<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:28.700> let<00:03:28.820> me<00:03:28.910> get<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.120> in

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
all know play-doh but let me get it in

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.240 
all know play-doh but let me get it in
here<00:03:29.330> I<00:03:29.360> have<00:03:29.510> my<00:03:29.590> Christmas<00:03:30.590> tree<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.070> use

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
here I have my Christmas tree that I use

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.850 
here I have my Christmas tree that I use
a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:33.770> cut<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:38.090> then<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.270> can<00:03:38.450> kind<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.860> get

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
a lot to cut and then we can kind of get

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.820 
a lot to cut and then we can kind of get
an<00:03:40.010> idea<00:03:40.100> here<00:03:42.010> okay<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:45.050> one<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.320> just<00:03:45.530> it's

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
an idea here okay this one is just it's

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.850 
an idea here okay this one is just it's
it's<00:03:46.070> it's<00:03:46.450> completely<00:03:47.450> different<00:03:47.860> than

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
it's it's completely different than

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.050 
it's it's completely different than
play-doh

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.410 

and<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.810> holds<00:03:55.990> its<00:03:56.230> shape<00:03:56.290> different<00:03:57.420> and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
and it holds its shape different and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.050 
and it holds its shape different and
it's<00:03:58.870> easier<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.230> take<00:03:59.470> out<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.890> molds<00:04:00.250> and

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
it's easier to take out of the molds and

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.530 
it's easier to take out of the molds and
let's<00:04:01.270> try<00:04:01.740> who<00:04:02.740> almost<00:04:02.980> mixed<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:03.550> hot<00:04:04.330> ball

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
let's try who almost mixed my hot ball

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.780 
let's try who almost mixed my hot ball
here<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> don't<00:04:05.020> have<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.170> lot<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.790> model

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
here I don't have a lot of this model

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.360 
here I don't have a lot of this model
magic<00:04:10.620> now<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.830> one<00:04:12.069> also<00:04:12.480> stained<00:04:13.480> my<00:04:13.720> top

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
magic now this one also stained my top

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.009 
magic now this one also stained my top
the<00:04:15.370> model<00:04:15.700> magic<00:04:16.030> now<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.180> doesn't<00:04:16.389> cut<00:04:16.840> as

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
the model magic now it doesn't cut as

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.190 
the model magic now it doesn't cut as
easy<00:04:20.940> okay<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.000> there's<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.540> three<00:04:22.840> shapes

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
easy okay so there's the three shapes

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.340 
easy okay so there's the three shapes
and<00:04:25.710> let's<00:04:26.710> just<00:04:26.950> see<00:04:27.130> see<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.300> one's<00:04:28.480> kind

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
and let's just see see that one's kind

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.350 
and let's just see see that one's kind
of<00:04:29.410> got<00:04:29.590> an<00:04:29.710> interesting<00:04:30.010> consistency<00:04:30.910> this

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
of got an interesting consistency this

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.120 
of got an interesting consistency this
one<00:04:31.600> will<00:04:31.780> Bend<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.350> lot<00:04:32.500> easier

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
one will Bend a lot easier

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.360 
one will Bend a lot easier
this<00:04:33.490> one<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.840> stiffer<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.980> seems<00:04:36.220> to

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
this one it's stiffer and it seems to

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.110 
this one it's stiffer and it seems to
crack<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.800> one<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.130> me<00:04:39.250> still<00:04:39.669> seems<00:04:39.940> like<00:04:40.000> a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
crack this one to me still seems like a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.540 
crack this one to me still seems like a
cross<00:04:40.480> between<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.960> two<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.890> heaviest<00:04:42.370> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
cross between the two the heaviest the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.900 
cross between the two the heaviest the
lightest<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.210> in<00:04:43.960> between<00:04:44.410> let<00:04:45.040> me<00:04:45.100> just<00:04:45.310> cut

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
lightest and in between let me just cut

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.620 
lightest and in between let me just cut
my<00:04:46.060> trees<00:04:46.950> like<00:04:47.950> if<00:04:48.100> I<00:04:48.220> was<00:04:48.370> playing<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:49.330> kind

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
my trees like if I was playing it kind

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.580 
my trees like if I was playing it kind
of<00:04:49.750> goes<00:04:50.680> in<00:04:50.979> and<00:04:51.870> kind<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.960> forms<00:04:53.320> with<00:04:53.560> the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
of goes in and kind of forms with the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.640 
of goes in and kind of forms with the
knife<00:04:53.860> as<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.160> cut<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:54.669> cuts<00:04:55.030> more<00:04:55.650> evenly

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
knife as you cut this cuts more evenly

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.430 
knife as you cut this cuts more evenly
and<00:04:56.950> straight<00:04:57.370> see<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.540> so<00:04:58.870> let's<00:04:59.050> cut<00:04:59.290> the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
and straight see that so let's cut the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.380 
and straight see that so let's cut the
last<00:04:59.620> one<00:05:01.919> closer<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.100> play-doh<00:05:03.460> when<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.150> cuts

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
last one closer to play-doh when it cuts

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.360 
last one closer to play-doh when it cuts
and<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:05.320> see<00:05:05.530> it<00:05:05.620> didn't<00:05:05.860> even<00:05:05.950> make<00:05:06.160> like<00:05:06.310> a

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
and it see it didn't even make like a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
and it see it didn't even make like a
nice<00:05:07.120> complete<00:05:07.630> cut<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:09.910> takes<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.240> little

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
nice complete cut so it takes a little

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.260 
nice complete cut so it takes a little
more<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:11.169> cut<00:05:11.380> through<00:05:11.650> that<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.910> like<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.210> said

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
more to cut through that so like I said

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.630 
more to cut through that so like I said
these<00:05:16.600> videos<00:05:16.990> are<00:05:17.140> made<00:05:17.289> for<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.250> to<00:05:18.340> kind<00:05:18.580> of

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
these videos are made for you to kind of

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.730 
these videos are made for you to kind of
look<00:05:19.090> at<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.390> differences<00:05:20.020> they're<00:05:20.590> all

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
look at the differences they're all

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.850 
look at the differences they're all
gonna<00:05:20.950> model<00:05:21.550> differently<00:05:22.000> as<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.180> can<00:05:22.450> tell

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
gonna model differently as you can tell

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.800 
gonna model differently as you can tell
so<00:05:23.860> they<00:05:23.979> all<00:05:24.130> have<00:05:24.430> unique<00:05:24.810> characteristics

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
so they all have unique characteristics

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.590 
so they all have unique characteristics
