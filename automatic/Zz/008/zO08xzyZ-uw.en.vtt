00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.300
 withings home is the product that wants 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.070
 a little do everything cameras from 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.500
 CCTV sensors for the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.600
 ambient air pollution baby monitor and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 then lullaby then wanting too much in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.670
 make 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.119
 does the product do it well we will 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.119
 look at that 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.460
 we will quickly pass on 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.920
 the installation it is very simple to 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.810
 operate either you opt for the interface 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.940
 ethernet for a wifi connection 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.470
 all the configuration goes through 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.270
 the app for now and well 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.030
 it's the first criticism exclusively 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.760
 compatible ios so smartphone or 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.989
 tablet the application withings home on 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.370
 android would be in the process of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.290
 development there was a specificity 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.850
 first we wanted to show you on 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.449
 this product well it's this hood that we 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 can remove 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.309
 here again the idea is to be able to vary 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.050
 the shells here imitation wood for 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.570
 associate her in any case the bride to 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.820
 better with your other point furniture 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.899
 strong the quality therefore of the application 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.580
 even if it is not for now 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.020
 compatible only with apple products 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.600
 it has the merit of being reactive fluid 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.440
 clear enough to use so from this point 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.440
 from there no problem 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.720
 the concern is that according to us withings 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.080
 home and well to many points 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.880
 low 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.980
 the first the sensor 5 million 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.260
 pixels present in front if he promises a 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.390
 full hd image in practice it's often 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.520
 very pixelated it's really not very 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.980
 pretty including on night vision 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.600
 or finally the scope is of only 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.820
 a few meters we estimate roughly 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.860
 3.4 m beyond you will not see anything 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.110
 the other weak point is well concern 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.790
 always this optical part quality of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 the image since if yes fixed first a 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.210
 zoom 12 times in practice it is 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.590
 frankly unconvincing when 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.300
 starts to zoom in the image and well 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.650
 it is much too degraded if the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.390
 bic phone function is fun on 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.280
 this type of ip camera since you're going 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.840
 can monitor baby from your 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.000
 mobile she is once again pretty 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.310
 poorly realized the quality of the image on 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.010
 you already talked about it here the idea was 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.090
 to interact with the baby so in him 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.190
 especially talking to him 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.050
 if you are remote from your 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.550
 mobile the problem is it's that the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.440
 speaker quality that is present 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.790
 on the top is not powerful enough 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.070
 and that finally we do not hear big 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.459
 thing when talking about other functions 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.200
 a little more evolved the lullaby so here 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.000
 in the base is integrated a system of 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.620
 led that can be varied from 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.690
 automatically so since the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.610
 smartphone there again the power is 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.680
 unimportant so it will have to have 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.480
 really the baby's reach camera and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.980
 especially the lullaby that is used in 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.630
 the occurrence will I tell you mom 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.680
 turn in loop it's finally more 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.680
 stressful than anything else 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.030
 the verdict you will have understood it is not 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.040
 finally not very positive for wings 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.629
 home a picture quality not so good 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.430
 functions finally that are going 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.239
 to be anecdotal for us this is 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.239
 not a product we recommend
