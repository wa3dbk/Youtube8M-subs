yards<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.299> gains<00:01:15.630> solid<00:01:15.990> stone<00:01:16.170> which

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
yards I think it gains solid stone which

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.170 
yards I think it gains solid stone which
is<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> 90<00:01:16.890> percent<00:01:17.009> damage<00:01:17.520> reduction<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.060> it

petrify the raid and they'll each take

turns at trying to petrify the raid it's
shown<00:01:27.869> by<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.680> bar<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.130> mean<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.520> the

shown by a little bar I mean on the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
shown by a little bar I mean on the
footage<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> actually<00:01:31.020> hidden

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
footage you see now it's actually hidden

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.319 
footage you see now it's actually hidden
underneath<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.979> grid<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.700> didn't

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
underneath my grid because I didn't

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
underneath my grid because I didn't
really<00:01:33.450> design<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.990> UI<00:01:34.170> too<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.070> here's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
really design my UI too well but here's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.760 
really design my UI too well but here's
an<00:01:35.369> image<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> bar<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
an image you can see it's just a bar and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
an image you can see it's just a bar and
when<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> bar<00:01:38.159> reaches<00:01:38.549> full<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.360> everyone

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
when the bar reaches full then everyone

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.929 
when the bar reaches full then everyone
becomes<00:01:40.110> petrified<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:41.820> you're

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
becomes petrified and when you're

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
becomes petrified and when you're
petrified<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.079> white<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> a5<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
petrified that's a white the a5 you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
petrified that's a white the a5 you
can't<00:01:44.220> move<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.610> act<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> moved<00:01:45.420> asset<00:01:45.930> GG

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
can't move or act and you moved asset GG

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.800 
can't move or act and you moved asset GG
however<00:01:47.040> while<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.610> petrify<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.630> on

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
however while the petrify is going on

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.389 
however while the petrify is going on
depending<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.590> mob<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.159> you'll

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
depending on which mob is from you'll

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
depending on which mob is from you'll
take<00:01:50.610> 90<00:01:51.000> percent<00:01:51.329> less<00:01:51.509> damage<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
individual abilities from that mob so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
individual abilities from that mob so
for<00:01:54.540> example<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> Jasper<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.740> you'll

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
for example if it's a Jasper one you'll

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
for example if it's a Jasper one you'll
take<00:01:56.790> 90<00:01:57.030> percent<00:01:57.299> less<00:01:57.360> damage<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:57.930> Jasper

take 90 percent less damage from Jasper

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.940 
take 90 percent less damage from Jasper
abilities

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
abilities

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.100 
abilities
exactly<00:01:59.520> now<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> stone<00:02:00.210> guard<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.750> overload

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
exactly now a stone guard will overload

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.450 
exactly now a stone guard will overload
once<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.439> reach<00:02:01.590> 100<00:02:02.009> percent<00:02:02.280> energy

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
once they reach 100 percent energy

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
once they reach 100 percent energy
causing<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> ton<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> damage<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.079> raid<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
causing a ton of damage to your raid and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.010 
causing a ton of damage to your raid and
also<00:02:05.040> clearing<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> petrify<00:02:06.149> bar<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
also clearing the petrify bar now the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
also clearing the petrify bar now the
overload<00:02:07.439> damage<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.890> actually<00:02:08.069> reduced<00:02:08.700> by

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
overload damage is actually reduced by

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999 
overload damage is actually reduced by
the<00:02:09.000> petrify<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.840> Jasper<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.530> petrifying

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the petrify so if Jasper is petrifying

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.559 
the petrify so if Jasper is petrifying
and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.310> Jasper<00:02:11.520> overloads<00:02:12.150> you'll<00:02:12.300> only<00:02:12.420> be

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
and then Jasper overloads you'll only be

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.460 
and then Jasper overloads you'll only be
taking<00:02:12.870> 10%<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
taking 10% of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.110 
taking 10% of
damage<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.190> too<00:02:14.340> much<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.610> an<00:02:14.700> issue<00:02:14.820> but

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
damage it's not too much of an issue but

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120 
damage it's not too much of an issue but
if<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.570> other<00:02:15.600> ones<00:02:15.930> are<00:02:16.110> overloading<00:02:16.980> it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
if the other ones are overloading it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.410 
if the other ones are overloading it
will<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.310> doing<00:02:17.430> quite<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> bit<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.970> damage<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
will be doing quite a bit of damage you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.760 
will be doing quite a bit of damage you
want<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.600> minimize<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> amount<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.590> other

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
want to minimize the amount the other

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.590 
want to minimize the amount the other
ones<00:02:20.070> overload<00:02:20.520> if<00:02:20.700> they're<00:02:20.880> not<00:02:21.000> petrifying

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
ones overload if they're not petrifying

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.750 
ones overload if they're not petrifying
now<00:02:22.170> because<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:22.950> mechanic<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> way<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
now because of this mechanic the way it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
now because of this mechanic the way it
works<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.180> completely<00:02:24.660> affects<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.380> way<00:02:25.500> that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
works it completely affects the way that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.320 
works it completely affects the way that
you<00:02:25.710> position<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.220> boss<00:02:26.400> he<00:02:26.940> needs<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.210> make

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
you position the boss he needs to make

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.520 
you position the boss he needs to make
sure<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.630> have<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> main<00:02:28.020> tank<00:02:28.290> that's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
sure that you have a main tank that's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.840 
sure that you have a main tank that's
tanking<00:02:28.860> two<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.220> guards<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.700> want

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
tanking two of the guards and you want

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.190 
tanking two of the guards and you want
your<00:02:29.940> other<00:02:30.120> tank<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.540> tank<00:02:30.690> one<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.050> other

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
your other tank to tank one of the other

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.260 
your other tank to tank one of the other
guards<00:02:31.530> away<00:02:31.710> from<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> raid<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.910> not

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
guards away from the raid so it it's not

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.730 
guards away from the raid so it it's not
generating<00:02:33.750> any<00:02:33.870> energy<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> don't

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
generating any energy because you don't

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.100 
generating any energy because you don't
into<00:02:35.040> overload<00:02:35.460> because<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.420> have<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.780> next

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
into overload because you have to next

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.570 
into overload because you have to next
to<00:02:37.200> each<00:02:37.290> other<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:37.710> both<00:02:38.010> gaining

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
to each other they are both gaining

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.760 
to each other they are both gaining
energy<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.110> need<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.260> make<00:02:40.470> sure<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
energy and so you need to make sure that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.800 
energy and so you need to make sure that
when<00:02:41.220> they<00:02:41.340> overload<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:41.910> only<00:02:42.180> overload

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
when they overload they only overload

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.360 
when they overload they only overload
when<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.080> petrify<00:02:43.530> stacks<00:02:43.860> are<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.220> right

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
when the petrify stacks are on the right

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.240 
when the petrify stacks are on the right
person<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.480> example<00:02:45.959> if<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.290> main<00:02:46.950> tank

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
person so for example if the main tank

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.220 
person so for example if the main tank
is<00:02:47.520> tanking<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.360> don't<00:02:48.480> know<00:02:48.540> they<00:02:48.690> say<00:02:48.900> Jade

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
is tanking I don't know they say Jade

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
is tanking I don't know they say Jade
and<00:02:49.380> amethyst<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.490> other<00:02:50.670> tank<00:02:50.940> is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and amethyst and the other tank is

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.790 
and amethyst and the other tank is
tanking<00:02:51.480> Jasper<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.050> you've<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.260> started

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
tanking Jasper and you've just started

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.070 
tanking Jasper and you've just started
to<00:02:52.890> receive<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.490> petrified<00:02:54.360> from<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.660> Jasper

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
to receive a petrified from the Jasper

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
to receive a petrified from the Jasper
you<00:02:55.560> need<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.770> make<00:02:55.920> sure<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.340> main<00:02:56.520> tank

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you need to make sure that the main tank

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.210 
you need to make sure that the main tank
taunts<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> Jasper<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.410> he<00:02:58.590> now<00:02:58.740> has<00:02:58.770> three

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
taunts the Jasper so he now has three

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190 
taunts the Jasper so he now has three
mobs<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.850> other<00:03:00.090> tank<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.630> originally

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
mobs and the other tank that originally

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050 
mobs and the other tank that originally
had<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.770> then<00:03:01.890> tanks<00:03:02.280> over<00:03:02.580> another<00:03:02.880> one

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
had just but then tanks over another one

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
had just but then tanks over another one
ideally<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> one<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.230> highest<00:03:04.380> energy

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
ideally the one with the highest energy

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.110 
ideally the one with the highest energy
because<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> want<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.550> make<00:03:05.700> sure<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.000> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
because you want to make sure that the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.490 
because you want to make sure that the
overloads<00:03:06.600> are<00:03:06.780> spread<00:03:06.990> out<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.200> much<00:03:07.350> as

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
overloads are spread out as much as

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140 
overloads are spread out as much as
possible<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.520> do<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.760> correctly<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
possible if you do this correctly you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.370 
possible if you do this correctly you
can<00:03:09.330> make<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> never<00:03:10.020> have<00:03:10.260> an

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
can make it so you never have an

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.690 
can make it so you never have an
overload<00:03:10.800> when<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.250> don't<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
overload when you don't have the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.400 
overload when you don't have the
petrified<00:03:12.150> stacks<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.570> correct<00:03:12.900> petrify

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
petrified stacks the correct petrify

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.410 
petrified stacks the correct petrify
however<00:03:14.070> if<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:14.970> wrong<00:03:15.209> if<00:03:15.330> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
however if you do do this wrong if you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
however if you do do this wrong if you
do<00:03:15.510> fuck<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.020> bit<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.410> do<00:03:16.560> get<00:03:16.740> overload

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
do fuck up a bit and you do get overload

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.800 
do fuck up a bit and you do get overload
when<00:03:17.580> there<00:03:17.760> isn't<00:03:17.970> even<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.480> correct

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
when there isn't even the correct

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.020 
when there isn't even the correct
petrify<00:03:19.290> stacks<00:03:19.709> are<00:03:19.890> up<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:20.730> you'll<00:03:20.850> take<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
petrify stacks are up then you'll take a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.729 
petrify stacks are up then you'll take a
lot<00:03:21.209> damage<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.810> won't<00:03:22.080> kill<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.560> yes

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
lot damage but you won't kill you yes

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.830 
lot damage but you won't kill you yes
thank<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.310> looks<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:24.090> fucking<00:03:24.570> angry

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
thank you looks very fucking angry

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.500 
thank you looks very fucking angry
that's<00:03:25.410> all<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.769> will<00:03:25.860> do<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.150> doesn't

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
that's all it will do so if it doesn't

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.990 
that's all it will do so if it doesn't
matter<00:03:27.810> too<00:03:28.050> much<00:03:28.080> however<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.370> essential

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
matter too much however is essential

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.690 
matter too much however is essential
that<00:03:30.030> when<00:03:30.390> you're<00:03:31.080> petrify<00:03:31.739> stack<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:32.280> of

that when you're petrify stack is of

that when you're petrify stack is of

that mob type that that mob type does

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.420 
that mob type that that mob type does
overload<00:03:35.250> yeah<00:03:35.610> or<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.239> wipe<00:03:36.420> exactly<00:03:37.410> now<00:03:38.340> on

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
overload yeah or you wipe exactly now on

overload yeah or you wipe exactly now on
top<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.940> did<00:03:39.060> also<00:03:39.239> mention<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
top of this we did also mention that the

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.810 
top of this we did also mention that the
bosses<00:03:40.530> do<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:41.040> their<00:03:41.190> own<00:03:41.310> individual

bosses do have their own individual

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.759 
bosses do have their own individual
abilities<00:03:42.299> now<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> Jade<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.470> will<00:03:43.590> cost

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
abilities now the Jade one will cost

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.020 
abilities now the Jade one will cost
something<00:03:43.980> called<00:03:44.190> Jade<00:03:44.400> shards<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:44.880> there's

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
something called Jade shards and there's

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.520 
something called Jade shards and there's
nothing<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.570> do<00:03:45.660> about<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.989> all<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.410> is

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
nothing you can do about this all it is

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.770 
nothing you can do about this all it is
is<00:03:46.709> raid<00:03:46.920> damage<00:03:47.160> simple<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.000> however<00:03:48.540> if

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
is raid damage simple as that however if

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.360 
is raid damage simple as that however if
you<00:03:48.989> are<00:03:49.019> being<00:03:49.350> petrified<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.860> mean<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.220> is

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
you are being petrified I mean this is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.320 
you are being petrified I mean this is
something<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.730> might<00:03:50.850> want<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
something you might want to know it's

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.699 
something you might want to know it's
not<00:03:51.450> actually<00:03:51.750> too<00:03:51.870> important<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.680> are

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
not actually too important if you are

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.580 
not actually too important if you are
getting<00:03:53.580> Jade<00:03:53.940> petrified<00:03:54.570> then<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.380> Jade

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
getting Jade petrified then the Jade

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.710 
getting Jade petrified then the Jade
shards<00:03:55.950> will<00:03:56.040> do<00:03:56.160> 90<00:03:56.519> percent<00:03:56.880> less<00:03:57.030> damage<00:03:57.390> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
shards will do 90 percent less damage so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.390 
shards will do 90 percent less damage so
it's<00:03:57.900> nothing<00:03:58.350> yeah<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:58.980> nothing

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
it's nothing yeah and it's nothing

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.070 
it's nothing yeah and it's nothing
anyways<00:03:59.820> nothing<00:04:00.000> anyway<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:00.660> very<00:04:00.690> little

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
anyways nothing anyway it's very little

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.870 
anyways nothing anyway it's very little
healing<00:04:01.260> required<00:04:01.799> then<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.400> amethyst

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
healing required then the amethyst

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.400 
healing required then the amethyst
Guardian<00:04:03.239> will<00:04:03.360> cost<00:04:03.540> amethyst<00:04:04.019> pool<00:04:04.260> which

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
Guardian will cost amethyst pool which

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.960 
Guardian will cost amethyst pool which
is<00:04:04.440> basically<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.010> little<00:04:05.340> pool<00:04:05.489> on<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.640> floor

spawns beneath the random player and it

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.830

fire<00:05:31.320> damage<00:05:31.680> every<00:05:31.920> second<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.430> also<00:05:32.610> it

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
fire damage every second and also it

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.150 
fire damage every second and also it
does<00:05:33.270> 15%<00:05:33.930> more<00:05:34.110> damage<00:05:34.170> every<00:05:34.770> second<00:05:35.100> that

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
does 15% more damage every second that

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.190 
does 15% more damage every second that
you're<00:05:35.340> apart<00:05:35.730> so<00:05:36.120> basically<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.810> really

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
you're apart so basically it really

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.960 
you're apart so basically it really
fucking<00:05:37.530> hurts<00:05:37.710> after<00:05:38.160> a<00:05:38.220> while<00:05:38.400> but

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
fucking hurts after a while but

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.520 
fucking hurts after a while but
basically<00:05:39.360> so<00:05:39.570> what<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.810> do<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.110> that<00:05:40.140> you

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
basically so what you do is that you

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.500 
basically so what you do is that you
just<00:05:40.740> stand<00:05:40.980> together<00:05:41.130> for<00:05:41.670> 30<00:05:41.880> seconds

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
just stand together for 30 seconds

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.730 
just stand together for 30 seconds
because<00:05:42.630> that's<00:05:42.840> how<00:05:42.960> long<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.260> debuff<00:05:43.560> is

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
because that's how long the debuff is

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.380 
because that's how long the debuff is
however<00:05:43.980> there's<00:05:44.400> another<00:05:44.640> way<00:05:44.850> of<00:05:44.970> breaking

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
however there's another way of breaking

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.480 
however there's another way of breaking
the<00:05:45.480> chains<00:05:45.750> if<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.440> spend<00:05:46.710> more<00:05:46.890> than<00:05:47.100> 15

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
the chains if you spend more than 15

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.730 
the chains if you spend more than 15
seconds<00:05:47.940> apart<00:05:48.210> whilst<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.140> have<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.410> debuff

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
seconds apart whilst you have the debuff

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.500 
seconds apart whilst you have the debuff
on<00:05:49.919> you<00:05:50.130> so<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.310> know<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.640> spent<00:05:50.880> 7<00:05:51.180> seconds

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
on you so I know you spent 7 seconds

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.880 
on you so I know you spent 7 seconds
apart<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.900> go<00:05:51.990> together<00:05:52.169> again<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.830> then

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
apart and go together again and then

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.740 
apart and go together again and then
spend<00:05:53.220> another<00:05:53.490> eight<00:05:53.730> seconds<00:05:54.210> apart<00:05:54.480> the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
spend another eight seconds apart the

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.780 
spend another eight seconds apart the
chains<00:05:55.020> will<00:05:55.230> actually<00:05:55.770> break<00:05:56.040> however<00:05:56.430> this

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
chains will actually break however this

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.250 
chains will actually break however this
is<00:05:56.940> doing<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.300> fuck<00:05:57.660> ton<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:57.930> unnecessary

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
is doing a fuck ton of unnecessary

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.890 
is doing a fuck ton of unnecessary
damage<00:05:58.890> if<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.220> can<00:05:59.400> avoid<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.730> but<00:06:00.480> if<00:06:00.540> the

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
damage if you can avoid it but if the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.960 
damage if you can avoid it but if the
Jasper<00:06:01.320> Guardian<00:06:01.830> is<00:06:01.980> casting<00:06:02.430> petrified

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
Jasper Guardian is casting petrified

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.730 
Jasper Guardian is casting petrified
then<00:06:03.150> obviously<00:06:03.300> you're<00:06:03.600> taking<00:06:03.870> 90%<00:06:04.560> less

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
then obviously you're taking 90% less

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.680 
then obviously you're taking 90% less
damage<00:06:05.070> from<00:06:05.220> Jasper<00:06:05.640> chains<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.570> can

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
damage from Jasper chains so you can

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.970 
damage from Jasper chains so you can
pretty<00:06:06.840> much<00:06:06.930> ignore<00:06:07.380> it<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.590> be<00:06:07.710> honest<00:06:07.890> as

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
pretty much ignore it to be honest as

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.620 
pretty much ignore it to be honest as
long<00:06:08.100> as<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.370> got<00:06:08.910> to<00:06:08.970> keep<00:06:09.150> an<00:06:09.330> eye<00:06:09.419> on<00:06:09.450> how

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
long as you got to keep an eye on how

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.970 
long as you got to keep an eye on how
much<00:06:09.810> damage<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.200> are<00:06:10.230> taking<00:06:10.770> because<00:06:10.860> of

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
much damage you are taking because of

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.860 
much damage you are taking because of
how<00:06:11.280> it<00:06:11.460> stacks<00:06:11.790> up<00:06:12.030> as<00:06:12.210> well<00:06:12.390> so<00:06:12.419> just<00:06:12.600> make

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
how it stacks up as well so just make

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.970 
how it stacks up as well so just make
sure<00:06:12.900> your<00:06:13.110> healers<00:06:13.320> keep<00:06:13.470> an<00:06:13.590> eye<00:06:13.710> on<00:06:13.740> you<00:06:13.950> and

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
sure your healers keep an eye on you and

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.080 
sure your healers keep an eye on you and
you're<00:06:14.430> not<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> dick

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
you're not a dick

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.060 
you're not a dick
so<00:06:15.660> yeah<00:06:15.870> and<00:06:16.050> although<00:06:16.200> just<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.770> footage

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
so yeah and although just the footage

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.220 
so yeah and although just the footage
on-screen<00:06:17.580> is<00:06:17.760> obviously<00:06:18.060> 25-man<00:06:18.810> we<00:06:18.990> didn't

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
on-screen is obviously 25-man we didn't

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.130 
on-screen is obviously 25-man we didn't
have<00:06:19.380> Jasper<00:06:19.919> in<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.280> in<00:06:20.850> the<00:06:21.000> 10th<00:06:21.240> week<00:06:21.810> but

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
have Jasper in the in the 10th week but

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.810 
have Jasper in the in the 10th week but
it<00:06:22.290> works<00:06:22.500> exactly<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:23.010> same<00:06:23.100> works<00:06:23.550> exactly

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
it works exactly the same works exactly

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.940 
it works exactly the same works exactly
the<00:06:23.970> same<00:06:24.080> so<00:06:25.080> that's<00:06:25.230> more<00:06:25.350> or<00:06:25.410> less<00:06:25.500> say<00:06:25.770> all

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
the same so that's more or less say all

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
you need to do is make sure that your

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.600 
you need to do is make sure that your
tanks<00:06:27.570> and<00:06:27.900> control<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.800> petrify<00:06:29.220> make<00:06:29.460> sure

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
tanks and control the petrify make sure

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.800 
tanks and control the petrify make sure
the<00:06:29.760> right<00:06:29.970> mob<00:06:30.180> overloads
