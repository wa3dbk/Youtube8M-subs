 found pilgrims departing from the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.350
 white city 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.450
 to bring the greeting before departure 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.010
 the vicar forane don giovanni 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.020
 apollinare the mayor of ostuni 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.850
 gianfranco coppola accompanied 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.130
 from the councilor for social policies

 spiritual of the unitary subsection 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.250
 of brindisi don paolo zofra that Saturday 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.950
 last in a Eucharistic celebration 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.410
 had started the 2014 pilgrimage on 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.040
 pilgrimage begins we could say every 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.170
 day and this is the culminating moment 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.190
 this go with lourdes right in the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.920
 place of the madonna 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.759
 but I like to see just the sense 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 of pilgrimage as a walk 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.209
 continuously meeting those values ​​that 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.760
 born for us Christians from 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.560
 faith and then from that faith that brings us 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.959
 also solidarity 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.440
 I hope I see so much enthusiasm 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.020
 here at the station 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.170
 the enthusiasm of those who come for the first 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.110
 turn to lourdes or whoever comes from many 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.720
 years but always starts with that 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.680
 curiosity the beautiful curiosity is that that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:40.060
 value of opening the heart to that 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 novelty you go there to receive something yes 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 he goes there to give something but he returns 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.700
 from the pilgrimage with the joy of 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.690
 that conversion that brings a 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.640
 change of life 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.830
 a very long journey by train 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.960
 with a particularity the presence of the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.630
 sick sometimes even sick with 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.270
 particular gravity with details 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.070
 disability is what characterizes him 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.750
 so yes not a trip but a 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.300
 pilgrimage with the brothers 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.360
 suffering and this is precisely the meaning 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.750
 Also sacrifice no I think we 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.750
 more young 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.540
 we find it hard to sacrifice ourselves for some 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.850
 things, however, this pilgrimage 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.310
 especially that of this year because 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.130
 we are really full in all 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.550
 senses and therefore we will be tight with the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.050
 sacrifice but with so much joy that that 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.170
 to share with our brothers 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.520
 here too I like to call back 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.760
 what goes from francesco says of the 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.570
 sick people are poor people of 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.209
 health 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.250
 here this poverty leads us then to 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.590
 get rich here is evidence of what we do 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.019
 missing and what really matters 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.680
 that goodness love and mercy 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.680
 of God 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.710
