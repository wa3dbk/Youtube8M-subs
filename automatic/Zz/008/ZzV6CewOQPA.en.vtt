00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.920
 Lined up for 90 minutes like a big pearl necklace 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.449
 Season finale of the 2008 season attack 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.569
 it is the ride of the ADAC Formula Masters 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:16.589
 Welcome to the right-wing extremist ADAC motorsport-magazine 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.369
 Glock No who attacked the last race of 2008 the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.830
 next 45 minutes we will report about it 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.859
 besides, the episode can be seen 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 this time to hear 2 again on the 3rd 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.749
 Parente here in the front left came first with Welt 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.590
 from May on the red-white-red could drive 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.180
 past 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.320
 behind it it was tight but all came through the first bottleneck 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 Klara state loser 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.250
 Amano Parente 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.720
 lined up 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.870
 but nonsense was from the beginning the fastest in the field of the Dane 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770
 grew up in Spain after the big pressure on 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.670
 Sören are 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.770
 so let him get in would be a hotter 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430
 Become championship candidate in Formula Masters 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.559
 in the city destination 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.559
 We leave here the leading position of Money 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.940
 the whiz-starters Simon Schempp reached 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.700
 Problems six races five 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.320
 OMV finish arrivals four composition - three first places and two second 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.980
 a unique record that leaves no questions unanswered 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.840
 the general at the Côte Formel Masters and the man with the least 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.810
 run 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 most victories 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.460
 it would be nonsense won before Monien Parenteau and Abs the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460
 championship third Bachler only with the sixth place 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.399
 at God of was 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.939
 Eagles of both states I had a much better start than yesterday 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.539
 crazy wheels everything fit because the duo I could equal talents and 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.830
 a little later overtake mouth 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.590
 we want to wait 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.720
 In the meantime, Tom Kristensen also received a visit from the Audi Sport Team Abt 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840
 from an old known one 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 Formula series winner Marko Sören Suhr 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.719
 On the other hand everybody I really know him very well since he almost out of the 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.230
 same city in the north of Denmark we talk a lot and he gave as well 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.589
 already many helpful advice about the route here St 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.949
 world Premiere 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.889
 CareFusion by Christensen Leadership 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.059
 - Papa Sören are involved as a father of three Christensen anyway 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.049
 interested in good youth promotion 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.250
 the ADAC demands that his coach 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.219
 The first thing she does is that she does not want to take herself 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.650
 that too is in the hands of VW see that fits 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.460
 Zeil himself lives where Peter keeps countries fence post or gps device 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.929
 many parts of society are a tough one 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.160
 one of the biggest 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.710
 he is sure Marko Sören are his successes in the expiring season 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.230
 maybe a bit on the advice of his role model Tom 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.230
 Attributed to Kristensen 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.469
 more often over the shoulder to look 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.869
 the first race is about to happen, but it's a decision 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:11.719
 like 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.449
 it was that Klaus Bachler could not become a master anymore 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.449
 Qualification 65 thousandths too slow 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.909
 who would have been the spot when he is on tour with 13 8 points 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.899
 then the championship would have arithmetically still in there so stands 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.899
 Now Markuse and fully understand it is now beating 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.889
 he wanted to be in front of a big backdrop 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.239
 his successful story continues six races so far 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.689
 celebrated the first session with them in the series the Dane three 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.609
 Victories and the second place next to Sören are already mentioned Klaus 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.979
 Bachler both on wet tires the track to early morning hour on 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.529
 Saturday wet and relatively cold 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.529
 seven degrees Celsius 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.159
 the penalty-free the two remaining championship candidates Armando Parente 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.959
 the Portuguese 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.779
 in the picture and teammate Nico Marwin Monien both from Team Univ 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:12.529
 Motorsport and both slicks on a rather unusual risky 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.529
 Decision of the team leader and the two drivers 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.409
 23 starters overall in the penultimate race of the premiere season of the ADAC 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.449
 Formula Masters and the best start Markus Pommer caught by the fifth 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.729
 position 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.300
 she expects 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.660
 Parente and «Money makes big trouble to get going 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.789
 for our front then Pommer after loading lost a position 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.039
 just ask yourself 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.969
 So there were patents and monies fighting with the previous blunt weapons 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.979
 clearly inferior to the competition also turned in Armando Parente at 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.770
 turn into the Parabolica the long curve 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.159
 in the direction of hairpin so that he had to hunt the field afterwards 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.270
 but he was not the only one 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.320
 even in the first round it also caught as the sheep Steinhart us Dennis 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.020
 by Meier both in the Motodrom of Hockenheim next to the track on slicks 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.850
 Waas simply Tomte this teammate Parente the fourteenth have been wrong 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.449
 are against it happy lonely race had at the end twelfth seconds 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.110
 head Start 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.390
 and even had to be careful that it was not over the top so easy and loose 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.389
 Medien his first appearance in Hockenheim by the hand 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.650
 Markus Pommer finally became a podium result for him 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.740
 Monday clearly third on Earth at the end of the procession again in March 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.430
 instead of 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.389
 the further placements 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.210
 Daniel Abt on the 4 and Christian Vander 8 on his best result of the season 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.210
 on the 5th 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.330
 Overall, the fourth victory for the best party song in its seventh 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.240
 Race an incredible 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.629
 balance sheet 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.169
 what would have happened if he had been in Prague from the beginning of the meeting? 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.169
 Formula Masters been there 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.599
 who 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.559
 I enjoy being here to do it is amazing from time to time it does 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.779
 Honest to me more fun 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.490
 the deserved winner said it was Marko Sören 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.190
 you'll have to remember that name on top of the podium 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.870
 the Austrian lost his third place overall to the Danes Sören are in 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:34.939
 passed the table at the creek and after his success to right from 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.339
 Team Marc Cohn 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.649
 Team boss Fabian Hambüchen celebrate
