00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.264
 - How are you, it's Collins Key, 

00:00:01.264 --> 00:00:02.972
 a happy Thanksgiving Hangover. 

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:05.461
 I hope you had a fantastic Thanksgiving holiday. 

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:07.616
 My favorite things about Thanksgiving are of course, 

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:08.600
 spend time with your family, 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.578
 And eating as much food as you want 

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.822
 for a day and nobody looks at you. 

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.053
 it's fantastic 

00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:17.543
 So, for this video today, Thanksgiving has inspired me a little. 

00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:20.385
 I want to do an "actually eat a fight". 

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.041
 I want to make it extreme so I make it extreme, 

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.053
 I'm going to get a small person. 

00:00:25.053 --> 00:00:26.800
 The destroyer of the world. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.154
 (growling) 

00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:30.344
 (laugh) 

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.473
 Devan Key! 

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:32.306
 - [both] Hi! 

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:33.264
 - What is it! 

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:34.097
 How are you? 

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:34.930
 - That's probably the best intro 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.293
 I've ever had. - Destroyer of worlds. 

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:37.565
 - Destroyer of worlds! 

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:38.977
 (Growling) 

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:40.126
 - Turn up. - Yes. 

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:40.993
 - Come on, let's stand here 

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:41.826
 looks better. - All right. 

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:42.659
 - Okay cool, hey! - Hey what up! 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:43.492
 - Now look normal. 

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:45.225
 - For this pie food contest, I brought it. 

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:46.058
 (Laughs) In your face. 

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:46.891
 - A cake. 

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:47.724
 - A cake! 

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:49.583
 And I have to eat this cake in a minute. 

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.393
 And the reason that Devan is here, because Devan 

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:53.445
 the cake will be defender. 

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:54.288
 His only job 

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.391
 is to ensure that I cannot eat this cake 

00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:57.326
 in that time. 

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:58.537
 And the winner can do the other 

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.629
 with some whipped cream in the face. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.544
 (Laughs) 

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:02.377
 Let's start. 

00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:03.210
 - Give the cake some whipped cream. 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.733
 - Oh no! 

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.566
 (spray bottle) 

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.785
 (Laughs) 

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:07.841
 It's just like, oh no! 

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.410
 dude it seems like diarrhea. 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.530
 is really really necessary? 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.399
 (Voice tracks speeds up) 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.375
 Yo! 

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.269
 Look at this! 

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:19.048
 There is no way that I can eat this in a minute. 

00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:20.206
 (Laughs) 

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:21.332
 There is no way! 

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.450
 - I'm going to win! 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.317
 - Cake eating contest starts in three, two, one, go! 

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:27.150
 grunt 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.170
 - [Devan] OK. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.003
 (Calls) 

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.098
 (Shoot Nerf gun) 

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:32.705
 - You hit me in the face! 

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.122
 (shout) 

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:37.906
 Oh! 

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:40.156
 (Laughs) 

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.013
 My eye! 

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:48.263
 (grunts) 

00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:51.602
 (Laughs) 

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:55.952
 - You laughed, you laughed! 

00:02:06.928 --> 00:02:07.761
 - No! 

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:09.763
 No! 

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.394
 - You can't leave it like that! 

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:14.561
 (scream) 

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.719
 (Shout) 

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.469
 - Okay, let's see what we can do with this. 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:26.514
 (Laughs) 

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.014
 (Toy singing) 

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:32.619
 That does not work! 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.869
 (Laughs) 

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:36.956
 All right. 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.766
 (shout) 

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:43.336
 Oh! 

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:44.392
 I think we hit a minute. 

00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:45.562
 I think it's been a minute. 

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:46.667
 - Okay, we're going for it! 

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.537
 - It's been a minute. 

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:49.768
 - It's in my nose! 

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.352
 It's in my nose! 

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:52.275
 (plugged) 

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.555
 - No, it's done! 

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:54.388
 It's a minute! 

00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:55.810
 - That was disgusting! 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.273
 Okay so Devan won this challenge 

00:02:57.273 --> 00:02:59.746
 He can now hit me with a hand full of whipped cream. 

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.634
 (Sigh) I'm not happy with this, 

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:03.046
 I don't know how I ever thought I could win this challenge 

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:04.845
 in the first place, this was impossible. 

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:05.870
 First of all! 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.920
 That Nerf thing! 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.065
 It literally hit me right in the eyes! 

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.104
 really straight to the eye! 

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:13.222
 (shout) 

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:14.745
 And then you hit me with a sock straight in the eyes 

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:16.603
 right after that! 

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:19.181
 I could not see out of this eye for a few seconds! 

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.881
 it's in my sock. 

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:21.723
 It's just like in my sock. 

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:22.941
 This is worse than wet socks. 

00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:24.396
 Look down at all the junk. 

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:25.644
 Look at this. 

00:03:25.644 --> 00:03:26.477
 - [Devan] Look at that. 

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:27.807
 - That's disgusting! 

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.176
 Look at those f ******* apples. 

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.009
 - Here we go. 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.842
 - Yes! 

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:32.550
 (Laughs) 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.626
 - Look at all that glory. 

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:34.938
 - please give me a thumbs up 

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:36.247
 because this is, this is like a blow to the hand 

00:03:36.247 --> 00:03:37.080
 this is going to hurt. 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.913
 - Three, two. 

00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:38.746
 (smack) 

00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:40.014
 - Oh! 

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:41.669
 You hit it in my ear! 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.502
 (Laughs) 

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:44.240
 It's all in my ear! 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.305
 What f ***! 

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:46.891
 I hear nothing with this ear. 

00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:49.105
 I'm going to get an infection in my ear, bro! 

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:50.884
 - We're going for another blow 

00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:51.900
 because it was really bad 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.297
 Three two one. 

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:54.130
 (smack) 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.990
 (Shouts) 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.072
 I got it in my ear 

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:57.641
 Oh! aah! it's in my eyes. 

00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.634
 Oh! 

00:03:58.634 --> 00:03:59.598
 (Laughs) 

00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:00.523
 Not really! 

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:01.356
 Not really! 

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:05.432

00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.462
 (Laughs) 

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:22.295
 Second try.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.236

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:25.069

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:28.468
 Oh I wanted to hit him with the cake in his face.

 Bye!
