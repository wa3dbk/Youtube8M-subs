00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
movie was more aimed towards kids
whereas<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> first<00:01:45.030> movie<00:01:45.360> was<00:01:45.540> aimed

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
whereas the first movie was aimed

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
whereas the first movie was aimed
towards<00:01:46.560> everyone<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.979> felt<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.610> felt<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
towards everyone I felt I felt like the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940 
towards everyone I felt I felt like the
first<00:01:48.509> movie<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> was<00:01:48.990> laughing<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
first movie I was laughing a lot of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.429 
first movie I was laughing a lot of
things<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.759> movie<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.630> things<00:01:52.200> out

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
things this movie was more things out

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.520 
things this movie was more things out
kids<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.920> laugh<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
kids would laugh and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.560 
kids would laugh and
so<00:01:55.430> yeah<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.820> was<00:01:55.909> a<00:01:55.940> little<00:01:56.060> disappointing

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
so yeah that was a little disappointing

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.330 
so yeah that was a little disappointing
a<00:01:56.630> guess<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.380> kind<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.890> figure<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.310> I

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
a guess but I kind of figure that I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.920 
a guess but I kind of figure that I
would<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.790> first<00:01:58.940> one<00:01:59.150> more<00:01:59.479> anyway<00:01:59.869> so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
would like the first one more anyway so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.520 
would like the first one more anyway so
