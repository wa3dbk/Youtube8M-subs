body moving the air around you you might

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.810 
body moving the air around you you might
have<00:02:25.260> heard<00:02:25.350> recently<00:02:25.530> about<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.640> this

discovered so Bri explain what you're

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.160 
discovered so Bri explain what you're
doing<00:02:40.290> right<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.570> have<00:02:42.570> been<00:02:42.750> reading

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
doing right now I have been reading

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.509 
doing right now I have been reading
about<00:02:43.290> all<00:02:43.590> these<00:02:43.739> different<00:02:43.980> subatomic

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
about all these different subatomic

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.789 
about all these different subatomic
particles<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:46.230> very

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
particles and I know a little very

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.220 
particles and I know a little very
little<00:02:46.950> about<00:02:47.549> at<00:02:47.880> least<00:02:48.420> electrons<00:02:49.049> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
little about at least electrons and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.289 
little about at least electrons and
stuff<00:02:49.470> from<00:02:49.650> chemistry<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.850> haven't<00:02:51.060> taken

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
stuff from chemistry but I haven't taken

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.920 
stuff from chemistry but I haven't taken
a<00:02:51.480> physics<00:02:51.840> class<00:02:52.019> yet<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.130> I'm<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.519> like

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
a physics class yet so I'm just like

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.180 
a physics class yet so I'm just like
confused<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.260> every<00:02:55.560> time<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.739> read<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.040> I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
confused like every time I read it I

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.890 
confused like every time I read it I
understand<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.299> soon<00:02:57.330> as<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.720> look

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
understand it and then as soon as I look

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.590 
understand it and then as soon as I look
away<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.620> don't<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.910> I'm<00:03:00.030> taking<00:03:00.390> notes

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
away I don't get it so I'm taking notes

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.979 
away I don't get it so I'm taking notes
and<00:03:00.840> trying<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> figure<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.840> love<00:03:03.840> how

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
and trying to figure it out I love how

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.840 
and trying to figure it out I love how
brie<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.350> confused<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:05.250> she<00:03:05.610> doesn't

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
brie is confused because she doesn't

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.110 
brie is confused because she doesn't
understand<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.620> most<00:03:07.799> complex<00:03:08.400> physics

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
understand like the most complex physics

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120 
understand like the most complex physics
that<00:03:09.299> we've<00:03:09.480> ever<00:03:09.750> come<00:03:10.110> up<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:11.070> a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that we've ever come up with as a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.640 
that we've ever come up with as a
species<00:03:11.489> like<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.060> concept<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.470> good

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
species like the concept but that's good

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.930 
species like the concept but that's good
that<00:03:13.680> you're<00:03:13.920> trying<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.280> she's<00:03:14.459> all<00:03:14.580> taking

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
that you're trying to she's all taking

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.940 
that you're trying to she's all taking
notes<00:03:15.060> okay<00:03:15.420> don't<00:03:15.720> understand<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.440> which

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
notes okay don't understand this which

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.229 
notes okay don't understand this which
is<00:03:17.100> good<00:03:17.310> because<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.549> want<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.760> understand<00:03:18.150> it

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
is good because I want to understand it

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.560 
is good because I want to understand it
as<00:03:18.360> well<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.709> want<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.250> at<00:03:20.370> least

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
as well I want it I want to at least

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.319 
as well I want it I want to at least
understand<00:03:21.570> what<00:03:22.170> all<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.620> words<00:03:22.890> mean<00:03:23.329> even

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
understand what all the words mean even

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.000 
understand what all the words mean even
if<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.510> still<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> concept<00:03:25.799> because

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
if I still don't get the concept because

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.890 
if I still don't get the concept because
it<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.579> tricky<00:03:26.970> concept<00:03:27.510> i<00:03:27.660> mean<00:03:27.840> i

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
it is a really tricky concept i mean i

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.930 
it is a really tricky concept i mean i
don't<00:03:28.079> think<00:03:28.230> anyone<00:03:28.470> exactly<00:03:29.370> understands

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
don't think anyone exactly understands

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.960 
don't think anyone exactly understands
it<00:03:30.030> how<00:03:30.209> long<00:03:30.360> has<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.600> been<00:03:30.720> now<00:03:31.019> Brie<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:38.760> has

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
it how long has it been now Brie it has

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.550 
it how long has it been now Brie it has
been<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.209> lot<00:03:39.480> longer<00:03:39.690> than<00:03:40.019> an<00:03:40.140> hour<00:03:40.260> really

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
been a lot longer than an hour really

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.860 
been a lot longer than an hour really
you've<00:03:43.560> been<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:43.950> probably<00:03:44.640> 3-4<00:03:45.630> hours

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
you've been at this probably 3-4 hours

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.810 
you've been at this probably 3-4 hours
now<00:03:46.049> I've<00:03:46.560> almost<00:03:46.799> got<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.100> kind<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.489> figured

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
now I've almost got it kind of figured

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.050 
now I've almost got it kind of figured
out<00:03:48.019> I've<00:03:49.019> seen<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.410> done<00:03:50.040> some<00:03:50.340> color<00:03:50.609> coded

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
out I've seen you done some color coded

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.750 
out I've seen you done some color coded
stuff

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
stuff

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
stuff
looks<00:03:51.909> like<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.180> thought<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.599> were<00:03:52.659> on

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
looks like you thought you were on

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.240 
looks like you thought you were on
something<00:03:53.170> here<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:53.409> then<00:03:53.560> realized<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.069> it

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
something here but then realized that it

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.100 
something here but then realized that it
was<00:03:54.370> either<00:03:54.519> irrelevant<00:03:55.299> no<00:03:55.540> these<00:03:55.810> are<00:03:55.989> only

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
was either irrelevant no these are only

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.660 
was either irrelevant no these are only
scratched<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.860> because<00:03:57.099> now<00:03:57.250> I've<00:03:57.370> included

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
scratched out because now I've included

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.759 
scratched out because now I've included
them<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.030> my<00:03:58.239> chart<00:03:58.569> that's<00:03:58.750> less<00:03:59.319> confusing

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
them in my chart that's less confusing

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.220 
them in my chart that's less confusing
to<00:04:00.099> me<00:04:00.250> yeah<00:04:00.640> I'm<00:04:01.090> transferring<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.840> crazy

the<00:04:51.699> news<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:51.910> i<00:04:52.120> think<00:04:52.360> but<00:04:53.050> well<00:04:53.440> yeah<00:04:53.650> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
the news is i think but well yeah the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.339 
the news is i think but well yeah the
Higgs<00:04:54.070> boson<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.789> just<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:56.580> manifestation<00:04:57.580> of

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
Higgs boson is just a manifestation of

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.050 
Higgs boson is just a manifestation of
other<00:04:59.349> particles<00:04:59.949> interacting<00:05:00.699> with<00:05:00.880> the

other particles interacting with the
Higgs<00:05:01.389> field<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.919> big<00:05:03.070> deal<00:05:03.310> is<00:05:03.460> that<00:05:03.490> the

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
Higgs field so the big deal is that the

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.080 
Higgs field so the big deal is that the
Higgs<00:05:04.000> field<00:05:04.419> exists<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.490> boson<00:05:06.880> just

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
Higgs field exists and the boson just

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.350 
Higgs field exists and the boson just
show<00:05:07.330> us<00:05:07.599> that<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.110> possibly<00:05:09.039> does<00:05:09.360> mm-hmm

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
show us that it possibly does mm-hmm

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.379 
show us that it possibly does mm-hmm
they<00:05:10.930> Higgs<00:05:11.560> boson<00:05:12.010> explains<00:05:12.520> where<00:05:12.880> some

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
they Higgs boson explains where some

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.300 
they Higgs boson explains where some
mass<00:05:13.660> is<00:05:13.990> coming<00:05:14.349> from<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:14.590> according<00:05:15.160> to

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
mass is coming from that according to

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.540 
mass is coming from that according to
our<00:05:15.400> current<00:05:15.729> model<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:17.530> shouldn't<00:05:18.160> be<00:05:18.310> there

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
our current model so shouldn't be there

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.939 
our current model so shouldn't be there
so<00:05:19.030> space<00:05:19.330> isn't<00:05:19.660> does<00:05:20.139> not<00:05:20.349> appear<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.710> be<00:05:20.800> the

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
so space isn't does not appear to be the

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.610 
so space isn't does not appear to be the

whether or not he's busy or not and
right<00:05:46.570> now<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:47.409> sure<00:05:47.680> looks<00:05:47.979> like<00:05:48.159> you're<00:05:48.570> it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
right now it sure looks like you're it

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.159 
right now it sure looks like you're it
looks<00:05:49.690> like<00:05:49.810> yeah<00:05:50.880> yeah<00:05:51.880> are<00:05:52.419> you<00:05:52.630> doing<00:05:53.020> a

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
looks like yeah yeah are you doing a

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.990 
looks like yeah yeah are you doing a
watch<00:05:53.590> repair<00:05:53.979> I<00:05:54.630> am<00:05:55.630> okay<00:05:56.580> is<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:57.760> a<00:05:57.789> battery

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
watch repair I am okay is that a battery

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.270 
watch repair I am okay is that a battery
or<00:05:58.360> no<00:05:58.570> band<00:05:58.840> he's<00:05:59.409> taking<00:05:59.590> links<00:06:00.010> out<00:06:00.099> of<00:06:00.219> a

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
or no band he's taking links out of a

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.119 
or no band he's taking links out of a
walk

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.679 

so<00:06:06.129> how<00:06:06.280> much<00:06:06.310> does<00:06:06.580> that<00:06:06.639> cost<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:07.180> do<00:06:07.330> to<00:06:07.599> have

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
so how much does that cost to do to have

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:19.740 
so how much does that cost to do to have
a<00:06:07.750> couple<00:06:08.199> links<00:06:08.349> taken<00:06:08.680> out<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:08.800> watch<00:06:09.960> yeah<00:06:18.750> I

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
a couple links taken out of watch yeah I

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.740 
a couple links taken out of watch yeah I
know<00:06:20.710> well<00:06:21.430> yeah<00:06:21.610> i<00:06:21.639> just<00:06:21.729> gotta<00:06:22.150> hit<00:06:22.389> the<00:06:22.509> pins

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
know well yeah i just gotta hit the pins

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.459 
know well yeah i just gotta hit the pins
out<00:06:22.930> I<00:06:24.000> never<00:06:25.000> thought<00:06:25.090> that<00:06:25.449> yeah<00:06:25.780> okay<00:06:26.259> let

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
out I never thought that yeah okay let

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.529 
out I never thought that yeah okay let
me<00:06:26.590> give<00:06:26.770> you<00:06:26.889> the<00:06:27.069> links<00:06:27.490> okay<00:06:27.879> to<00:06:27.939> get<00:06:28.240> fat

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
me give you the links okay to get fat

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.980 
me give you the links okay to get fat

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
see he says that every time yeah thinks

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.110 
see he says that every time yeah thinks
it's<00:06:32.139> so<00:06:32.349> funny<00:06:32.650> he<00:06:33.039> does<00:06:33.250> he<00:06:33.490> says<00:06:33.699> it<00:06:33.849> every

it's so funny he does he says it every
time<00:06:34.330> he<00:06:34.419> gives<00:06:34.599> a<00:06:34.719> link<00:06:40.620> but<00:06:41.620> I<00:06:41.740> mean<00:06:41.919> in

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
time he gives a link but I mean in

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.309 
time he gives a link but I mean in
fairness<00:06:43.120> it<00:06:43.479> is<00:06:43.629> the<00:06:43.810> only<00:06:43.930> time<00:06:44.139> you<00:06:44.169> would

fairness it is the only time you would
ever<00:06:44.440> need<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.770> links<00:06:45.009> again<00:06:45.099> or<00:06:45.610> if<00:06:45.759> you're

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
ever need the links again or if you're

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.640 
ever need the links again or if you're
gonna<00:06:45.969> give<00:06:46.210> it<00:06:46.330> to<00:06:46.449> someone<00:06:46.780> maybe<00:06:46.930> Oh<00:06:47.259> dad

listen uh what do you think about the
new<00:06:49.360> higgs<00:06:49.750> boson<00:06:50.289> being<00:06:51.129> discovered<00:06:51.840> the

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
new higgs boson being discovered the

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.839 
new higgs boson being discovered the
what<00:06:53.080> the<00:06:53.440> Higgs<00:06:53.650> boson<00:06:54.069> particle<00:06:54.099> what<00:06:54.789> do

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
what the Higgs boson particle what do

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.559 
what the Higgs boson particle what do
you<00:06:54.909> think<00:06:55.060> about<00:06:55.150> that<00:06:57.120> explains<00:06:58.120> to<00:06:58.270> me<00:06:58.389> why

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
you think about that explains to me why

you think about that explains to me why
everything<00:06:59.110> exists<00:07:00.840> because<00:07:01.840> God<00:07:02.289> makes<00:07:02.620> it

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
everything exists because God makes it

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:09.029 
everything exists because God makes it
okay<00:07:05.370> good<00:07:06.370> enough<00:07:06.699> for<00:07:06.879> me
