for<00:00:54.480> battlefield<00:00:54.840> 4<00:00:55.079> no<00:00:55.739> battlefield<00:00:56.190> 4<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
for battlefield 4 no battlefield 4 is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
for battlefield 4 no battlefield 4 is
just<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.809> better<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
just gonna be that little bit better the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
just gonna be that little bit better the
graphic<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> little<00:01:00.210> bit

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
graphic is going to be that little bit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.380 
graphic is going to be that little bit
better<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.199> know<00:01:01.820> LEvolution<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.940> stuff<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
better you know LEvolution and stuff I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.719 
better you know LEvolution and stuff I
imagine<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> take<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:04.350> FPS<00:01:04.949> so

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
imagine that's going to take some FPS so

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.940 
imagine that's going to take some FPS so
I<00:01:05.760> thought<00:01:06.119> I'm<00:01:06.450> gonna<00:01:06.900> beef<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.439> system<00:01:07.860> up

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I thought I'm gonna beef this system up

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.170 
I thought I'm gonna beef this system up
a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> bought<00:01:09.479> another<00:01:09.720> 670<00:01:10.470> now

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
a little bit so I bought another 670 now

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
a little bit so I bought another 670 now
let's<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.420> honest<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> people<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.520> OCD

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
let's be honest here and people with OCD

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
let's be honest here and people with OCD
are<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.080> normally<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
are not going to like this normally I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.969 
are not going to like this normally I
would<00:01:17.040> buy<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> 670<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> exact<00:01:19.650> same

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
would buy a 670 that is the exact same

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.210 
would buy a 670 that is the exact same
make<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.150> model<00:01:21.830> obviously<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.890> needs<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.159> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
make and model obviously it needs to be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.850 
make and model obviously it needs to be
the<00:01:23.340> same<00:01:23.490> modern<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.320> 617<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the same modern is to be this 617 but it

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
the same modern is to be this 617 but it
doesn't<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> same<00:01:26.460> make<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.210> one

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
doesn't have to be the same make so one

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.530 
doesn't have to be the same make so one
can<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.659> msi<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.409> could<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.650> EVGA<00:01:29.100> etc<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.909> had

can be msi one could be EVGA etc I had

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.270 
can be msi one could be EVGA etc I had
an<00:01:30.689> EVGA<00:01:31.159> 670<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.479> they're<00:01:33.479> around<00:01:33.780> back

but<00:02:26.510> let's<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.870> get<00:02:26.990> into<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> damn<00:02:27.530> box

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
but let's just get into the damn box

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.730 
but let's just get into the damn box
shall<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> box<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.959> kind<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.620> get

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
shall we so in the box you kind of get

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.890 
shall we so in the box you kind of get
what<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.160> expect<00:02:31.360> you've<00:02:32.360> got<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> couple<00:02:32.750> of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
what you expect you've got a couple of

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.310 
what you expect you've got a couple of
power<00:02:33.050> adapters<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.150> therefore<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.540> need

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
power adapters so therefore if you need

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.650 
power adapters so therefore if you need
a<00:02:36.350> 6-pin<00:02:37.100> power<00:02:37.670> adapter<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.300> power<00:02:38.480> your

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
a 6-pin power adapter to power your

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.840 
a 6-pin power adapter to power your
graphics<00:02:39.020> card<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.130> attach<00:02:40.550> them<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
graphics card you can attach them to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.300 
graphics card you can attach them to
some<00:02:41.000> molex<00:02:41.709> then<00:02:42.709> you've<00:02:42.860> got<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.100> card

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
some molex then you've got the card

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.330 
some molex then you've got the card
itself<00:02:43.490> obviously<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> bit<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.890> shit<00:02:46.130> box

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
itself obviously be a bit of a shit box

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.640 
itself obviously be a bit of a shit box
if<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:47.030> wasn't<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.480> there<00:02:47.690> then<00:02:48.410> hiding

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
if that wasn't in there then hiding

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
if that wasn't in there then hiding
