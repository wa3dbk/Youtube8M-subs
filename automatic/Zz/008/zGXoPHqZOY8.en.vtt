through<00:00:23.519> teamwork<00:00:23.970> instead<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.810> like

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
through teamwork instead of just like

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.259 
through teamwork instead of just like
individual<00:00:26.010> plays<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.150> really

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
individual plays so it was really

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.390
