00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.509
 and apply it 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 modeling 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.160
 but not before 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.370
 - 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 you have to do it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.870
 actually 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.930
 how 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.490
 visit 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.049
 d 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990
 the success 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.700
 for what 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.619
 the people is that the little eat 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.240
 what 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.690
 with activity but 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.630
 why not 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.630
 if there is little but obviously there is 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 no no 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.070
 here already about 300 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
 thinking 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.430
 that there is a force 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.110
 it looks many times is not right 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.080
 in the test time 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.189
 do not 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.500
 They do everything they can to repeat 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.180
 it was billed as thermos always and they are 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.480
 forever 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 hundred 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.690
 if we put finds in the same envelope 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.690
 counter 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.980
 for example 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.770
 Clear 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.080
 for the development with images of what 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.590
 what do you have to do 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.740
 obviously that s &amp; p creates a pigeon for 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.740
 example not loose of two hours 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500
 s 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.990
 think about things to extract for 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.990
 power 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.150
 but happening now 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.480
 then it comes that the issue of 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.480
 following 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.480
 d 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.910
 how do not you look for it in the house 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.910
 immediately 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.590
 homeless 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.129
 at home 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.520
 a house
