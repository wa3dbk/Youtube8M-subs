00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
you can see the growth there these guys
like<00:02:10.410> bright<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.510> filtered<00:02:12.510> sunlight

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like bright and filtered sunlight

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.860 
like bright and filtered sunlight
leaves<00:02:14.040> are<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:14.820> fine<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.300> them<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
leaves are very very fine on them so you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.030 
leaves are very very fine on them so you
wouldn't<00:02:16.110> want<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.350> put<00:02:16.470> them<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.710> direct

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
wouldn't want to put them in direct

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.270 
wouldn't want to put them in direct
sunlight<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> cat<00:02:18.030> Lea<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:19.230> during<00:02:20.190> their

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
sunlight like a cat Lea but during their

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.250 
sunlight like a cat Lea but during their
growing<00:02:20.490> season<00:02:20.580> they<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.390> lots<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.110> lots

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
growing season they like lots and lots

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.370 
growing season they like lots and lots
of<00:02:22.380> water<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.360> they<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.930> continue

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
of water and they are going to continue

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.160 
of water and they are going to continue
to<00:02:25.410> grow<00:02:25.650> they<00:02:26.610> get<00:02:26.820> each<00:02:27.180> bulb<00:02:27.540> usually

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
to grow they get each bulb usually

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.830 
to grow they get each bulb usually
produces<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.920> two<00:02:29.070> new<00:02:29.340> bulbs<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.060> so

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
produces one to two new bulbs on it so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.210 
produces one to two new bulbs on it so
they<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.590> spread<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.730> fast<00:02:34.100> what<00:02:35.100> I'm

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
they can spread really fast what I'm

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.860 
they can spread really fast what I'm
doing<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.700> I'm<00:02:35.940> digging<00:02:36.390> out<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.690> guy

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
doing here is I'm digging out this guy

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870 
doing here is I'm digging out this guy
from<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> back<00:02:37.380> now<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.760> I'm

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
from the back now this one here that I'm

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.910 
from the back now this one here that I'm
about<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.060> show<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.300> didn't<00:02:40.200> actually<00:02:40.440> flower

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
about to show you didn't actually flower

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.440 
about to show you didn't actually flower
this<00:02:41.190> year<00:02:41.430> went<00:02:41.610> straight<00:02:41.850> into<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.150> growth

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
this year went straight into the growth

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.080 
this year went straight into the growth
and<00:02:42.810> look<00:02:43.050> at<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> size<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.790> keep<00:02:44.940> in

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and look at the size of it so keep in

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.460 
and look at the size of it so keep in
mind<00:02:45.240> it's<00:02:45.360> further<00:02:45.660> away<00:02:45.900> than<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> orchids

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
mind it's further away than the orchids

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.550 
mind it's further away than the orchids
up<00:02:46.560> close<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.060> huge<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.410> is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
up close and it is just huge so this is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.950 
up close and it is just huge so this is
the<00:02:49.680> size<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.250> plant<00:02:50.520> during<00:02:51.510> its<00:02:51.690> growing

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
the size of the plant during its growing

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.100 
the size of the plant during its growing
season<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.060> still<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.750> bulb<00:02:54.960> is

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
season that one is still the bulb is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.440 
season that one is still the bulb is
just<00:02:55.350> starting<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:55.770> form<00:02:56.130> now<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.210> little

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
just starting to form now it's a little

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.970 
just starting to form now it's a little
bit<00:02:57.540> more<00:02:57.660> forms<00:02:58.020> than<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> last<00:02:58.470> ones<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
bit more forms than the last ones that I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.410 
bit more forms than the last ones that I
just<00:02:59.220> showed<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.460> but<00:03:00.090> doesn't<00:03:00.270> have

anything bulbous on it yet but that is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.070 
anything bulbous on it yet but that is
the<00:03:02.760> way<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.120> st<00:03:03.480> will<00:03:03.660> look<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the way a like st will look for the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.980 
the way a like st will look for the
summertime<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:06.120> can<00:03:06.270> see<00:03:06.450> why<00:03:06.600> with<00:03:06.660> these

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
summertime so you can see why with these

anything but a little bit cooler I'll
bring<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.250> back<00:03:26.370> down<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.760> flowers<00:03:27.239> here

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
bring it back down to the flowers here

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.580 
bring it back down to the flowers here
because<00:03:27.630> they're<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> little<00:03:27.930> more<00:03:28.170> exciting

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590

so if near the end of summertime the big
leaves<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.630> are<00:03:36.840> actually<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.739> start

leaves here are actually going to start

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.970 
leaves here are actually going to start
to<00:03:38.160> turn<00:03:38.370> yellow<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.930> leaves<00:03:40.110> only<00:03:40.290> last<00:03:40.650> for

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
to turn yellow the leaves only last for

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.699 
to turn yellow the leaves only last for
six<00:03:41.730> months<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.209> year<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.260> other<00:03:43.290> six

six months of the year and the other six

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.110 
six months of the year and the other six
months<00:03:43.830> they<00:03:44.130> are<00:03:44.160> actually<00:03:44.640> deciduous

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
months they are actually deciduous

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
months they are actually deciduous
they're<00:03:45.270> gonna<00:03:45.390> drop<00:03:45.600> off<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.709> once<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.130> see

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
they're gonna drop off so once you see

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.550 
they're gonna drop off so once you see
the<00:03:47.610> leaves<00:03:47.790> yellowing<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> cue<00:03:49.530> that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the leaves yellowing that is a cue that

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.350 
the leaves yellowing that is a cue that
you're<00:03:49.980> going<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.220> want<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.550> stop<00:03:50.820> watering

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
you're going to want to stop watering

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.140 
you're going to want to stop watering
the<00:03:51.450> plant<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.489> it's<00:03:53.489> going<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.820> start<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
the plant and it's going to start to

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.540 
the plant and it's going to start to

as<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.570> think<00:04:03.840> they<00:04:03.989> should<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.730> I'm<00:04:05.880> basing

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
as I think they should and I'm basing

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.030 
as I think they should and I'm basing
this<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.540> what<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.080> think<00:04:07.200> they<00:04:07.530> should<00:04:07.560> so

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
this on what I think they should so

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.380 
this on what I think they should so
maybe<00:04:08.489> they're<00:04:08.700> going<00:04:08.880> into<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.150> at<00:04:09.270> exactly

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
maybe they're going into it at exactly

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.080 
maybe they're going into it at exactly
the<00:04:09.930> right<00:04:10.050> time<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:10.500> them<00:04:10.650> but<00:04:11.519> they're

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
the right time for them but they're

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.310 
the right time for them but they're
going<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.360> start<00:04:12.600> losing<00:04:12.840> their<00:04:13.200> leaves

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
bulbs on there although you can divide

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.140 
bulbs on there although you can divide
them<00:04:31.009> and<00:04:31.160> start<00:04:31.310> new<00:04:31.430> Orcas<00:04:31.729> with<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:31.970> back

thing to note when the things are

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.189 
thing to note when the things are
leafless<00:04:46.970> here<00:04:47.180> when<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.539> like<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.900> sees<00:04:48.169> a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
each one of their bulbs and if you don't

each one of their bulbs and if you don't
know<00:04:53.150> they're<00:04:53.360> there<00:04:53.600> they<00:04:54.410> are<00:04:54.440> really

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
know they're there they are really

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
really sharp I don't know if I can get

really sharp I don't know if I can get
that<00:04:56.930> into<00:04:57.169> focus<00:04:57.470> properly<00:04:57.680> too<00:04:58.669> much<00:04:58.820> is

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
that into focus properly too much is

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.240 
that into focus properly too much is
happening<00:04:59.330> there<00:04:59.479> we<00:04:59.599> go<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.500> that<00:05:01.099> is<00:05:01.220> a

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
happening there we go so that is a

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.520 
happening there we go so that is a
protection<00:05:01.639> probably<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.270> wild<00:05:02.599> against

the animals chewing them the bulbs and
that<00:05:05.060> but<00:05:05.900> if<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.050> accidentally<00:05:06.620> forget

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
that but if you accidentally forget

that but if you accidentally forget
they're<00:05:07.070> there<00:05:07.099> and<00:05:07.340> you<00:05:07.400> get<00:05:07.580> nicked<00:05:07.820> by<00:05:07.970> it

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
they're there and you get nicked by it

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.909 
they're there and you get nicked by it
it<00:05:08.570> hurts<00:05:09.020> it<00:05:09.199> can<00:05:09.289> actually<00:05:09.560> draw<00:05:09.710> blood

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
it hurts it can actually draw blood

it hurts it can actually draw blood
they're<00:05:10.250> sharp<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.759> solid<00:05:11.330> can't<00:05:11.900> bend<00:05:12.139> them

they're sharp and solid can't bend them

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.770 
they're sharp and solid can't bend them
and<00:05:12.500> can't<00:05:12.680> break<00:05:12.919> them<00:05:13.070> at<00:05:13.220> all<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.660> they<00:05:14.660> get

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
and can't break them at all so they get

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.390 
and can't break them at all so they get

watering<00:05:28.849> them<00:05:29.000> three<00:05:29.720> to<00:05:29.840> four<00:05:30.139> times<00:05:30.349> a<00:05:30.560> week

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
watering them three to four times a week

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.500 
watering them three to four times a week
you're<00:05:31.159> probably<00:05:31.220> watering<00:05:31.909> them<00:05:32.030> once<00:05:32.300> every

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
you're probably watering them once every

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.710 
you're probably watering them once every
week<00:05:32.720> or<00:05:32.870> two<00:05:33.110> in<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:33.349> winter<00:05:33.620> time<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.720> then

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
week or two in the winter time and then

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.810 
week or two in the winter time and then
as<00:05:35.870> spring<00:05:36.229> approaches<00:05:36.740> give<00:05:37.220> them<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.520> cool

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
as spring approaches give them a cool

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.839 
as spring approaches give them a cool
bright<00:05:38.240> spot<00:05:38.630> in<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.260> bit<00:05:39.919> of<00:05:40.010> Morning<00:05:40.430> Sun<00:05:40.610> or

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
bright spot in the bit of Morning Sun or

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.670 
bright spot in the bit of Morning Sun or
even<00:05:41.090> afternoon<00:05:41.810> Sun<00:05:42.050> in<00:05:42.169> the<00:05:42.260> spring<00:05:42.500> because

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
even afternoon Sun in the spring because

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.500 
even afternoon Sun in the spring because
it's<00:05:42.830> not<00:05:42.949> that<00:05:43.130> hot<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:43.580> there's<00:05:44.150> no<00:05:44.270> leaves

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
it's not that hot and there's no leaves

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.899 
it's not that hot and there's no leaves
to<00:05:44.750> cook<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:45.530> they're<00:05:46.310> gonna<00:05:46.430> start<00:05:46.729> their

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
to cook and they're gonna start their

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.480 
to cook and they're gonna start their
growth<00:05:47.060> again<00:05:47.330> for<00:05:47.539> the<00:05:47.630> year<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.280> most<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.430> the

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
growth again for the year so most of the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.890 
growth again for the year so most of the
times<00:05:49.699> if<00:05:49.909> the<00:05:50.030> bulb<00:05:50.210> was<00:05:50.330> mature<00:05:50.659> they're

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
times if the bulb was mature they're

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.110 
times if the bulb was mature they're
going<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.169> produce<00:05:51.380> flowers<00:05:51.860> first<00:05:52.130> if<00:05:52.520> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
going to produce flowers first if the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.850 
going to produce flowers first if the
bulb<00:05:53.330> is<00:05:53.509> say<00:05:53.630> smaller<00:05:54.050> because<00:05:54.320> you've<00:05:54.620> done

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
bulb is say smaller because you've done

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.800 
bulb is say smaller because you've done
back<00:05:55.250> bulb<00:05:55.550> divisions<00:05:56.030> you<00:05:56.270> might<00:05:56.599> take<00:05:56.750> a

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
back bulb divisions you might take a

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.270 
back bulb divisions you might take a
year<00:05:56.900> or<00:05:57.169> two<00:05:57.289> to<00:05:57.320> build<00:05:57.560> up<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.860> bulb<00:05:58.070> size

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
year or two to build up the bulb size

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.390 
year or two to build up the bulb size
again<00:05:58.639> before<00:05:59.120> you<00:05:59.360> get<00:05:59.599> flowers<00:05:59.960> on<00:06:00.139> them<00:06:00.400> so

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
again before you get flowers on them so

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.189 
again before you get flowers on them so
although<00:06:02.180> these<00:06:02.300> ones<00:06:02.539> are<00:06:02.659> beautiful<00:06:02.810> and

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
although these ones are beautiful and

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.350 
although these ones are beautiful and
amazing<00:06:03.590> as<00:06:03.979> I<00:06:04.250> say<00:06:04.400> there<00:06:04.639> are<00:06:04.729> some<00:06:04.909> amazing

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
have eight flowers on each bulb but the

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.950 
have eight flowers on each bulb but the
flowers<00:06:17.930> they<00:06:18.050> do<00:06:18.110> have<00:06:18.440> are<00:06:18.710> absolutely<00:06:19.310> huge
