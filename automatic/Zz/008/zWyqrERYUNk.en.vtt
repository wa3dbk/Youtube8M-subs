less<00:02:24.680> powerful<00:02:25.099> application<00:02:25.819> okay<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.840> then

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
less powerful application okay and then

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.629 
less powerful application okay and then
you<00:02:27.230> have<00:02:27.379> these<00:02:27.530> two<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.909> basically<00:02:29.359> drag

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
you have these two and I basically drag

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.330 
you have these two and I basically drag
and<00:02:31.639> drop<00:02:32.290> drag<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.439> drop<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.889> it<00:02:33.950> copies<00:02:34.099> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and drop drag and drop and it copies it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.410 
and drop drag and drop and it copies it
over<00:02:34.639> there<00:02:34.790> very<00:02:35.719> easy<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.709> then<00:02:37.609> that's

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
over there very easy so then that's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.750 
over there very easy so then that's
about<00:02:38.689> it<00:02:38.719> so<00:02:39.290> all<00:02:39.439> I<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.829> do<00:02:39.919> now<00:02:40.099> is<00:02:40.129> go<00:02:40.700> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760
