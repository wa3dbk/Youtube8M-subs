pressure this new method is about to
reduce<00:00:31.380> dramatically<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> use<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.880> animals

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
reduce dramatically the use of animals

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
reduce dramatically the use of animals
for<00:00:33.630> experiments<00:00:35.809> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> old<00:00:37.140> days<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
for experiments in the old days you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.850 
for experiments in the old days you
needed<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> start<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.239> scratch<00:00:39.860> many

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
needed to start from scratch many

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.440 
needed to start from scratch many
animals<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> then<00:00:42.500> improve<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> drug<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
animals and then improve the drug it's a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510 
animals and then improve the drug it's a
long<00:00:45.690> process<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.320> improve<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.739> drug<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
long process to improve a drug to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.389 
long process to improve a drug to
improve<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> medication<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.039> then<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
improve a medication and then do the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.389 
improve a medication and then do the
animal<00:00:50.730> studies<00:00:51.030> again<00:00:51.949> what<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.250> do

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
animal studies again what you can do

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.209 
animal studies again what you can do
here<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> bring<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.350> drug<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
here is to bring the drug or the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.180 
here is to bring the drug or the
medication<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> level<00:00:58.079> where<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> performs

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
medication to a level where it performs

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.990 
medication to a level where it performs
well<00:00:59.300> in<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> tissue<00:01:00.629> engineering<00:01:01.170> model<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
well in a tissue engineering model and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
well in a tissue engineering model and
then<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> animal

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
then you can go on to do the animal

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
then you can go on to do the animal
studies<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> animal<00:01:06.720> studies<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.229> not

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
studies so the animal studies are not

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.070 
studies so the animal studies are not
completely<00:01:07.950> gone<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.240> amount<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
completely gone but the amount of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.070 
completely gone but the amount of
animals<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> need<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> sacrifice<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
animals that you need to sacrifice in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
animals that you need to sacrifice in
order<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.530> develop<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.010> medication<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:15.479> going

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
order to develop a medication is going

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.880 
order to develop a medication is going
to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.799> reduced<00:01:17.430> substantially

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.330 

we<00:01:23.890> have<00:01:23.979> developed<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.430> unique<00:01:25.710> method<00:01:26.710> to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
we have developed a unique method to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.210 
we have developed a unique method to
scan<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> cells<00:01:28.120> into<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.020> computer<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:30.159> is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
scan the cells into the computer this is

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.570 
scan the cells into the computer this is
a<00:01:30.369> real<00:01:30.580> cell<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:32.320> was<00:01:32.650> previously<00:01:33.220> observed

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
a real cell that was previously observed

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.210 
a real cell that was previously observed
under<00:01:33.940> microscope<00:01:34.570> then<00:01:35.260> scanned<00:01:35.770> into<00:01:36.070> a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
under microscope then scanned into a

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.670 
under microscope then scanned into a
computer<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.030> then<00:01:38.020> with<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.259> computer

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
computer and then with the computer

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.300 
computer and then with the computer
software<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.940> can<00:01:39.970> program<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.720> set<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:41.020> laws<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
software we can program a set of laws to

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.630 
software we can program a set of laws to
define<00:01:42.670> how<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:42.909> cell<00:01:43.270> behaves<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.979> to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
define how the cell behaves and then to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.990 
define how the cell behaves and then to
simulate<00:01:46.500> what-if<00:01:47.500> scenarios<00:01:48.130> one<00:01:48.640> if<00:01:48.820> we

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
simulate what-if scenarios one if we

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.300 
simulate what-if scenarios one if we
apply<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.360> load<00:01:49.780> or<00:01:50.080> that<00:01:50.350> load<00:01:50.619> with<00:01:51.190> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
apply this load or that load with the

apply this load or that load with the
cell<00:01:51.520> breakdown<00:01:52.000> will<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.840> cell<00:01:53.080> tear<00:01:53.289> apart

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
cell breakdown will the cell tear apart

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.580 
cell breakdown will the cell tear apart
this<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.490> what<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:54.820> try<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.030> do<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.479> Israel<00:01:55.990> to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
this is what we try to do in Israel to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.040 
this is what we try to do in Israel to
be<00:01:56.740> original<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.460> be<00:01:57.789> innovative<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.869> pop

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
be original to be innovative and to pop

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.830 
be original to be innovative and to pop
