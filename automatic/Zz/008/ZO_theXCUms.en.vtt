 glass of warm water with a hint of 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.439
 baking soda and that way 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.720

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.179
 what you're going to start doing is even 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.960
 to reduce the lines of expression on 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.790
 all those that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.470
 appear on the side and also 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.180
 in the corners of the lips but 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.369
 remember that you always have to give it a 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.590
 time and see how your body reacts 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.540

 life point number 4 you avoid the speed 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.960
 stomach obviously sometimes we 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.390
 we access a little more in certain 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.670
 food or we consume too much 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.290
 spicy or soda and especially when 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.729
 we have a very busy pace of life 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.590

 We can usually have problems 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 stomach and this way when you 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.440
 you start to combine and include the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.910
 sodium bicarbonate in your diet what 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.009
 you're going to start doing is to reduce the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.380
 heartburn and they're also going to start 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.539
 reduce bloating and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.220
 gases that accumulate in your body so 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.019
 that will invariably be a great 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.910
 Allied not only for you to get off 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.290

 energy to have in your day to day 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.600
