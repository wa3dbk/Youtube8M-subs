well<00:00:40.469> basically<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.309> works<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.879> after

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
well basically how this works is after

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.639 
well basically how this works is after
we<00:00:42.450> ate<00:00:42.480> bags<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.290> bags<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.800> dis<00:00:43.980> candy<00:00:45.649> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
we ate bags and bags of dis candy the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
we ate bags and bags of dis candy the
candy<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.160> fall<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.520> top<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.850> black<00:00:48.059> box

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
candy will fall on top of that black box

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
candy will fall on top of that black box
up<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> center<00:00:49.140> it'll<00:00:49.920> detect<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> color

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
up in the center it'll detect the color

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.340 
up in the center it'll detect the color
drop<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.570> onto<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> different

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
drop it down onto the different

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
drop it down onto the different
conveyors<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.399> drive<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.910> way<00:00:54.030> or

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
conveyors and then drive it one way or

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
conveyors and then drive it one way or
the<00:00:54.300> other<00:00:54.449> depending<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> color<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the other depending on the color and it

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.270 
the other depending on the color and it
will<00:00:56.489> end<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.449> six<00:00:57.780> tubes

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
will end up in one of these six tubes

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.240 
will end up in one of these six tubes
alright<00:00:59.280> time<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.820> demo<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.160> we've

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
alright time for a demo so what we've

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.670 
alright time for a demo so what we've
got<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> 12<00:01:03.480> volt<00:01:03.719> power<00:01:03.870> supply<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
got here is a 12 volt power supply that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
got here is a 12 volt power supply that
brings<00:01:05.250> power<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.700> again<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:06.810> Kevin<00:01:07.140> pointed

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
brings power in again as Kevin pointed

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.429 
brings power in again as Kevin pointed
out<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.950> color<00:01:08.369> sensor<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> black<00:01:09.990> box

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
out the color sensor is in the black box

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.920 
out the color sensor is in the black box
how<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.880> well<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> couple

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
how was it in there as well are a couple

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.460 
how was it in there as well are a couple
of<00:01:13.110> LEDs<00:01:13.290> white<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.430> color<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.320> what<00:01:16.320> they're

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
of LEDs white in color and what they're

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
of LEDs white in color and what they're
doing<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.220> putting<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.150> intensity<00:01:18.659> towards

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
doing is is putting in intensity towards

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.270 
doing is is putting in intensity towards
the<00:01:19.590> candy<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> comes<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:22.250> with<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the candy as it comes down and with a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.510 
the candy as it comes down and with a
50%<00:01:23.939> duty<00:01:24.060> cycle<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:25.170> sensor<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.189> able<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
50% duty cycle the sensor is able to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.630 
50% duty cycle the sensor is able to
detect<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.390> color<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.740> push<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> back<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
detect what color it is push it back to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.480 
detect what color it is push it back to
