00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.699
 but then it's not our culture yes since we're in phase that's 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:06.620
 obviously it's the worst thing 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.569
 480 horses under the hood 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.899
 3,092 01 this meaning 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.019
 physically based and tight 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.289
 we close the hood immediately since it is forbidden to roll 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.880
 convertible on this track 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 and the people who kill what it gives in terms of time and performance 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 a first case of victory 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.680
 on the second peloton the season 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.790
 volunteering that's valid to admit defeat right away 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 cardoso reacted the lawyer of m 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.610
 of course to receive you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.350
 about the right 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.890
 the 200 km of his car 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 whatever the sum 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440
 several generations the season 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.630
 and I am surprised by the night 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.630
 we are still in a cabriolet 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 ice on September 14th allows these worries 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.419
 the framework of this survey 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.019
 his method 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.019
 the last years 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.719
 robin wright penn are expected this summer the case 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.629
 for the reception of ordinary people 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.629
 the back of accelerations 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.019
 03 07 points 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.019
 the turbo diesel with each acceleration 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:13.899
 all are today 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.109
 we have a museum capote 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.629
 we took a knife 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.879
 race cars in terms of power 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.879
 it seems to me 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329
 I think we can do better 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.009
 in a field since I did not have a match that night 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.549
 snapped 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.789
 it is laurent fabius then to support this help
