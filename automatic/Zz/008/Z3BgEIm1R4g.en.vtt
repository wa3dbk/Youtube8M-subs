I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.700> below<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> cockpit<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I think that just below the cockpit so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.490 
I think that just below the cockpit so
you<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> slight<00:02:06.170> addition<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you have to have a slight addition to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.529 
you have to have a slight addition to
any<00:02:07.649> shots<00:02:08.069> using<00:02:08.340> those<00:02:08.610> specifically<00:02:09.149> when

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
any shots using those specifically when

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.479 
any shots using those specifically when
you're<00:02:09.690> aiming<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:10.590> trying<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.039> fire<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
you're aiming up or trying to fire up a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.540 
you're aiming up or trying to fire up a
cover

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
cover

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550 
cover
well<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.540> arms<00:02:13.810> really<00:02:13.990> do<00:02:14.200> make<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.530> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
well the arms really do make it a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.190 
well the arms really do make it a
greater<00:02:15.160> being<00:02:15.520> able<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.880> pop<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.960> shoot

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
greater being able to pop out and shoot

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.740 
greater being able to pop out and shoot
over<00:02:17.560> any<00:02:18.100> kind<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.550> cover<00:02:18.790> than<00:02:18.910> anyone<00:02:19.210> that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
over any kind of cover than anyone that

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.310 
over any kind of cover than anyone that
might<00:02:19.990> be<00:02:20.020> hiding<00:02:20.380> behind<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.600> at<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.080> point

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
might be hiding behind and at this point

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.490 
might be hiding behind and at this point
believe<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.310> caught<00:02:24.550> out<00:02:24.760> an<00:02:24.940> Orion<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.630> think

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
believe we caught out an Orion I think

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.280 
believe we caught out an Orion I think
that<00:02:26.680> somehow<00:02:27.520> got<00:02:27.970> there<00:02:28.180> very<00:02:28.540> quickly<00:02:28.840> I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
that somehow got there very quickly I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.170 
that somehow got there very quickly I
think<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.340> skirmish<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.880> might<00:02:31.030> actually

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
think in skirmish you might actually

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.290 
think in skirmish you might actually
start<00:02:31.390> near<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.350> location<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.730> he<00:02:33.970> I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
start near this location so I think he I

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.560 
start near this location so I think he I
think<00:02:35.050> he<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.470> ran<00:02:35.920> ahead<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.220> himself<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:37.060> I

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
think he just ran ahead of himself and I

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.010 
think he just ran ahead of himself and I
didn't<00:02:37.810> get<00:02:37.960> any<00:02:38.110> any<00:02:38.860> support<00:02:39.310> from<00:02:39.400> house

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.150 

yeah<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.080> spent<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.530> while<00:02:44.620> trying<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.920> maneuver

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
yeah I spent a while trying to maneuver

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.650 
yeah I spent a while trying to maneuver
in<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.490> one<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.970> got<00:02:46.120> my<00:02:46.210> first<00:02:46.390> hits

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
in this one but I got my first hits

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
in this one but I got my first hits
there<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.110> BB<00:02:47.320> season<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.710> can<00:02:47.860> see<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
there for the BB season you can see the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.820 
there for the BB season you can see the
heat<00:02:48.340> buildup<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.210> tour<00:02:49.390> wants<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:50.560> not

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
heat buildup in the tour wants it's not

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.740 
heat buildup in the tour wants it's not
something<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.160> can<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.400> regularly<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
something I can do regularly and the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.260 
something I can do regularly and the
standard<00:02:53.260> ppz<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:53.950> yeah<00:02:54.190> they'd<00:02:54.550> be<00:02:54.700> hotter

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
standard ppz there yeah they'd be hotter

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.200 
standard ppz there yeah they'd be hotter
that<00:02:55.740> was<00:02:56.740> there<00:02:56.890> right<00:02:57.070> he<00:02:57.880> was<00:02:58.000> getting

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
that was there right he was getting

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.210 
that was there right he was getting
pelted<00:02:58.360> nrm's<00:02:59.970> probably<00:03:02.010> blackjack<00:03:03.010> has<00:03:03.190> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
pelted nrm's probably blackjack has a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.590 
pelted nrm's probably blackjack has a
few<00:03:03.490> issues<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:04.090> has<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.240> relatively<00:03:04.630> easy<00:03:06.600> left

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
few issues it has a relatively easy left

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.120 
few issues it has a relatively easy left
and<00:03:07.780> right<00:03:07.900> or<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.560> could<00:03:08.650> be<00:03:08.680> blown<00:03:08.950> off

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
and right or so that could be blown off

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.370 
and right or so that could be blown off
though<00:03:09.400> quite<00:03:09.660> distinct<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.810> obvious<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.880> see

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
though quite distinct and obvious to see

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.050 
though quite distinct and obvious to see
which<00:03:14.380> means<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.920> running<00:03:15.370> an<00:03:15.520> XL<00:03:15.820> engine

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
which means if you running an XL engine

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.990 
which means if you running an XL engine
which<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.330> would<00:03:16.510> recommend<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.550> Mac<00:03:18.700> needs

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
which I would recommend as the Mac needs

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.870 
which I would recommend as the Mac needs
all<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.360> space<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.260> allow<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
all the space you can get to allow it to

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
all the space you can get to allow it to
do<00:03:22.920> or<00:03:23.920> built<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.880> builds<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.510> may<00:03:25.690> want

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
do or built kind of builds you may want

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.030 
do or built kind of builds you may want
to<00:03:25.989> bind<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:28.350> quite<00:03:29.350> possible<00:03:29.380> to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
to bind to that it's quite possible to

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.210 
to bind to that it's quite possible to
fit<00:03:30.780> three<00:03:31.780> maybe<00:03:32.020> four<00:03:32.410> people<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:32.770> seasons

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
fit three maybe four people you seasons

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.740 
fit three maybe four people you seasons
this<00:03:33.310> build<00:03:33.550> if<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.730> were<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.940> crazy<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:34.660> if

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
this build if you were that crazy but if

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.970 
this build if you were that crazy but if
you<00:03:34.810> just<00:03:34.989> wanted<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.410> high<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.739> four

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
you just wanted that high all four

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.520 
you just wanted that high all four
potential<00:03:36.459> it's<00:03:36.610> it's<00:03:37.120> there<00:03:37.420> for<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.780> I'm

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
potential it's it's there for you I'm

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.250 
potential it's it's there for you I'm
running<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.920> standard<00:03:39.310> than<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.520> one<00:03:39.730> because

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
running a standard than this one because

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.620 
running a standard than this one because
the<00:03:41.260> tabletop<00:03:42.220> build<00:03:42.430> kind<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.880> fit<00:03:43.209> perfectly

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
the tabletop build kind of fit perfectly

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.449 
the tabletop build kind of fit perfectly
for<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:43.930> it's<00:03:44.530> already<00:03:44.709> hot<00:03:45.010> enough<00:03:45.190> as<00:03:45.340> it

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
for this it's already hot enough as it

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.130 
for this it's already hot enough as it
is<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.670> think<00:03:45.730> what<00:03:46.000> an<00:03:46.120> excel<00:03:46.420> engine<00:03:46.720> will

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
is I think what an excel engine will

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.590 
is I think what an excel engine will
improve<00:03:47.500> its<00:03:47.680> chances<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:49.060> speeds<00:03:49.330> pretty

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
improve its chances the speeds pretty

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.790 
improve its chances the speeds pretty
decent<00:03:49.870> once<00:03:49.989> you've<00:03:50.110> got<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.320> be<00:03:50.440> tweaked<00:03:50.680> on

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
decent once you've got to be tweaked on

if<00:06:04.759> you<00:06:04.939> know<00:06:05.089> just<00:06:05.930> comment<00:06:06.589> on<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:07.639> way<00:06:07.789> I

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:07.819 
if you know just comment on the way I

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.389 
if you know just comment on the way I
may<00:06:08.300> have<00:06:08.389> taken<00:06:08.569> them<00:06:08.839> out<00:06:09.009> but<00:06:10.009> yeah<00:06:10.129> most

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:10.399 
may have taken them out but yeah most

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.189 
may have taken them out but yeah most
most<00:06:10.669> blacks<00:06:11.059> also<00:06:11.419> have<00:06:11.659> jump<00:06:12.050> jet

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
most blacks also have jump jet

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.529 
most blacks also have jump jet
capability<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:13.159> in<00:06:13.729> battle<00:06:14.120> tech<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.449> was

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
capability and in battle tech it was

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.329 
capability and in battle tech it was
more<00:06:14.719> of<00:06:14.779> an<00:06:14.870> urban<00:06:15.020> combat<00:06:15.439> max<00:06:15.800> so<00:06:16.009> just

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:16.339 
more of an urban combat max so just

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.879 
more of an urban combat max so just
better<00:06:17.120> used<00:06:17.599> for<00:06:17.959> jumping<00:06:18.559> around<00:06:18.649> on

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
better used for jumping around on

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.879 
better used for jumping around on
buildings<00:06:19.339> and<00:06:19.639> making<00:06:20.539> quick<00:06:20.839> strikes<00:06:21.169> I

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
buildings and making quick strikes I

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.309 
buildings and making quick strikes I
think<00:06:22.430> certain<00:06:22.789> next<00:06:23.029> lose<00:06:23.319> functionality

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
think certain next lose functionality

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.110 
think certain next lose functionality
when<00:06:25.009> it<00:06:25.099> translates<00:06:25.520> into<00:06:25.639> this<00:06:25.789> game<00:06:25.969> I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
when it translates into this game I

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.459 
when it translates into this game I
think<00:06:26.149> the<00:06:26.360> fire<00:06:26.569> starter<00:06:26.990> obviously<00:06:27.349> be

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
think the fire starter obviously be

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.829 
think the fire starter obviously be
bills<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:27.800> an<00:06:27.889> infantry<00:06:28.309> vehicle<00:06:28.729> loses<00:06:29.479> that

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:29.839 
bills in an infantry vehicle loses that

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.100 
bills in an infantry vehicle loses that
functionality<00:06:31.089> a<00:06:32.089> lot<00:06:32.629> of<00:06:32.719> people<00:06:32.930> on<00:06:32.990> the

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
functionality a lot of people on the

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.570 
functionality a lot of people on the
urban<00:06:33.229> mech<00:06:33.589> but<00:06:33.770> I<00:06:33.830> really<00:06:34.099> think<00:06:34.309> it<00:06:34.459> would

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
urban mech but I really think it would

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.189 
urban mech but I really think it would
only<00:06:34.759> work<00:06:35.209> in<00:06:35.479> this<00:06:35.659> kind<00:06:35.930> of<00:06:36.050> environment

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
only work in this kind of environment

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.749 
only work in this kind of environment
where<00:06:36.680> it<00:06:36.830> can<00:06:36.860> sort<00:06:37.309> of<00:06:37.339> hop<00:06:37.490> around

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
where it can sort of hop around

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.969 
where it can sort of hop around
buildings<00:06:38.240> but<00:06:38.629> even<00:06:39.229> then<00:06:39.379> it<00:06:39.499> would<00:06:39.589> do<00:06:39.830> very

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
buildings but even then it would do very

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.089 
buildings but even then it would do very
quickly<00:06:40.389> but<00:06:41.389> ya<00:06:41.599> know<00:06:42.259> long<00:06:42.469> video<00:06:42.769> not<00:06:43.039> the

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:43.099 
quickly but ya know long video not the

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:44.619 
quickly but ya know long video not the
most<00:06:43.279> exciting<00:06:43.580> video<00:06:44.059> but<00:06:44.269> it's<00:06:44.479> the

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
most exciting video but it's the

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.549 
most exciting video but it's the
blackjack<00:06:45.969> great<00:06:46.969> field<00:06:47.209> of<00:06:47.330> view<00:06:47.559> good

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:48.559 
blackjack great field of view good

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:51.460 
blackjack great field of view good
weapons<00:06:48.979> low<00:06:49.159> down

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:51.470 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.380 

probably<00:06:51.950> something<00:06:52.130> drove<00:06:52.310> axes<00:06:52.670> it's<00:06:52.850> wide

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
probably something drove axes it's wide

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.810 
probably something drove axes it's wide
sigh<00:06:53.690> torsos<00:06:54.140> and<00:06:54.220> what<00:06:55.220> muster<00:06:55.550> armor<00:06:55.790> I

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
guess for a fourth hotel it's not a huge

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.580 
guess for a fourth hotel it's not a huge
amount<00:06:57.500> but<00:06:58.030> yeah<00:06:59.110> definitely<00:07:00.110> one<00:07:00.500> of<00:07:00.530> my
