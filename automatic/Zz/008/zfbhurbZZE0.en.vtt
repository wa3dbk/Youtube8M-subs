 carol 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.849
 on the other hand 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.619

 carola 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 but what 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390
 carol 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 The lawyer 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.820
 account 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.430
 for 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.030
 but 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.610
 soon for love 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.790
 carola 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.600
 but democracy 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400
 but the truth 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 the lawyer does not 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 those achieved by 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.359
 now 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.040
 paul 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 soon 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.110
 I would like 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 show them a small piano tutorial 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 for those friends who are getting started on this 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.620
 piano study 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.840
 let's see some small techniques on the piano 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.360
 in what is the correct placement 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.320
 have the right sound 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 the correct articulation 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.210
 i small details that are really very important when it comes to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.270
 to practice 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 when it comes to studying and when playing piano 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.090
 maybe they are some 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.260
 Simple practices may be some 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.140
 simple tips 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 but with very valuable and very important 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.670
 and first of all I would like 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.170
 ask for the respect of dedicated to one of my colleagues colleagues of my colleague 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.560
 Pianist 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.810
 for these simple tips 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.869
 that he could grant for beginners 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.990
 those friends who are starting in this piano 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.199
 first of all 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.289
 for the study of the piano 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.309
 it is necessary to consider 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.139
 the correct posture 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.139
 the correct position on the piano 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.079
 we have to consider that some friends 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.319
 that are starting at the piano 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.169
 they have a position 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.629
 wrong at the time of sitting at the piano 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.529
 they form a curvature 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.899
 in her back 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.919
 and half an hour goes by an hour and even two hours in practice today 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.919
 between having the piano with that bad position 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.029
 it's about avoiding 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.799
 an injury to the back an injury 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.479
 to the column 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479
 and then comes the aesthetic reason 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.589
 it's a little 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.729
 it's a bit unpleasant to see a pianist 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.119
 percent 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.119
 why yes the sky vulgarly signed on the piano 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.899
 Conversely 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.899
 a pianist sitting straight 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.059
 has a 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.059
 better presentation so the public step 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.279
 and here I would like 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:23.489
 point 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.449
 and make a small parenthesis to dimension the villarreal for example 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.709
 the total no longer 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.579
 in a very special way 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.129
 he acquired that technique 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.230
 we should not criticize cynthia red for example a great pianist them 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.839
 the first steps of the piano 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.169
 in this case 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.919
 at the time of sitting 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.579
 haiti getting 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.999
 a seat that is comfortable 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.879
 a seat that is comfortable and that we 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.009
 we feel comfortable in that seat 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:04.169
 we have to spend half an hour we have to spend an hour even a couple of hours in it 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 seat touching the instrument 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.429
 the second 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.269
 the second form 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.139
 to consider 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.620
 to consider 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.759
 our elbow 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.319
 must be reading 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.319
 of our doll when playing the piano 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.949
 our cobo should be at the height of the wrist 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.949
 at the time of playing the piano 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.550
 Following 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.020
 the position of the hand 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.020
 we must imagine that we have below 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.819
 under our hand 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.449
 a tennis ball 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.900
 a fruit 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.620
 What I mean by this 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.620
 the position of the hand should be 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.500
 a hand 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.479
 curve 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.319
 the fingers must be curved 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.710
 the fingers should never touch the piano 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.909
 extended form 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.909
 We try to avoid injuries such as tendonitis, for example, due to the effort 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.909
 necessary of the tendons who do this 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.830
 at the time of playing 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.080
 you should look for the correct position and it is with the curved fingers 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.580
 attacking each key
