oh hello we're gonna look at something

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.619 
oh hello we're gonna look at something
which<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.580> very<00:00:02.669> different<00:00:03.240> hopefully

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
which is very different hopefully

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.610 
which is very different hopefully
something<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.110> you<00:00:04.200> haven't<00:00:04.350> seen<00:00:04.589> before

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
something that you haven't seen before

something that you haven't seen before
and<00:00:04.950> it's<00:00:05.220> something<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.700> I've<00:00:05.819> been

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
and it's something that I've been

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.880 
and it's something that I've been
secretly<00:00:06.480> working<00:00:06.569> on<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.290> little<00:00:07.440> while<00:00:07.620> now

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
secretly working on a little while now

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.940 
secretly working on a little while now
and<00:00:08.130> I'm<00:00:08.700> calling<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.210> pull<00:00:09.480> tracks<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.230> did<00:00:10.710> say

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
and I'm calling it pull tracks I did say

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.560 
and I'm calling it pull tracks I did say
the<00:00:11.130> secret<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.610> pull<00:00:11.759> tracks<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.389> now

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the secret of pull tracks is out now

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
the secret of pull tracks is out now
because<00:00:12.990> everyone<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.620> seeing<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.040> but<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
because everyone is seeing it but I

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.010 
because everyone is seeing it but I
developed<00:00:14.639> pull<00:00:15.030> tracks<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> number<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
developed pull tracks for a number of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.290 
developed pull tracks for a number of
reasons<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.279> reason<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.850> I'm<00:00:18.180> having

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
reasons the first reason is I'm having

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.029 
reasons the first reason is I'm having
trouble<00:00:18.720> getting<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:19.140> son<00:00:19.199> into<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> pool

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
trouble getting my son into the pool

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
trouble getting my son into the pool
it's<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.880> bit<00:00:21.000> perplexing<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:21.869> last<00:00:22.109> year

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's a bit perplexing because last year

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
it's a bit perplexing because last year
he<00:00:22.470> loved<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> pool<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.430> year<00:00:23.670> he<00:00:23.970> will

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
he loved the pool but this year he will

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.820 
he loved the pool but this year he will
not<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.510> near<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> pool<00:00:25.050> he<00:00:25.260> will<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.560> go<00:00:25.680> into

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
not go near the pool he will not go into

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
not go near the pool he will not go into
the<00:00:25.980> water<00:00:26.160> he<00:00:26.789> seems<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> fear<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the water he seems to have a fear of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.929 
the water he seems to have a fear of
water<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:29.070> my<00:00:29.220> family<00:00:29.670> lives<00:00:29.849> in

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
water and because my family lives in

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.759 
water and because my family lives in
Australia<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.810> an<00:00:30.929> island<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.470> think

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
Australia which is an island I think

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.139 
Australia which is an island I think
it's<00:00:31.890> pretty<00:00:32.040> important<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> know<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it's pretty important to know how to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's pretty important to know how to
swim<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:34.140> very<00:00:34.410> simple<00:00:34.739> idea<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.190> pool

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
swim this very simple idea of pool

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
swim this very simple idea of pool
tracks<00:00:35.850> basically<00:00:36.750> brings<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.260> toy<00:00:37.530> trains

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
tracks basically brings your toy trains

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
tracks basically brings your toy trains
to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.190> pool<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.329> best<00:00:39.540> thing<00:00:39.719> about

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
to the pool and the best thing about

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.360 
to the pool and the best thing about
that<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.770> ramps<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that is it really ramps up the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.330 
that is it really ramps up the
playability<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.450> simple<00:00:43.079> train<00:00:43.320> set<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
playability of a simple train set when I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
playability of a simple train set when I
was<00:00:44.520> developing<00:00:44.760> pool<00:00:45.239> tracks<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.750> did<00:00:45.930> try<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
was developing pool tracks I did try a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
was developing pool tracks I did try a
number<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.010> different<00:00:47.309> materials<00:00:47.370> as

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
number of different materials as

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
number of different materials as
flotation<00:00:48.300> aids<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> end<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
flotation aids and in the end the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
flotation aids and in the end the
simplest<00:00:50.370> solution<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
simplest solution was one of the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.720 
simplest solution was one of the
cheapest<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.050> let<00:00:52.739> me<00:00:52.890> guarantee<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
cheapest and let me guarantee to you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
cheapest and let me guarantee to you
pull<00:00:54.090> tracks<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.629> very<00:00:55.140> simple<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> make<00:00:55.770> and

pillow<00:03:49.320> pets<00:03:49.560> for<00:03:49.709> some<00:03:49.920> reason<00:03:50.250> my<00:03:50.340> daughter

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
pillow pets for some reason my daughter

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.890 
pillow pets for some reason my daughter
will<00:03:50.820> bring<00:03:51.000> out<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.209> pillow<00:03:51.390> pets<00:03:51.690> and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
will bring out the pillow pets and

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.780 
will bring out the pillow pets and
she'll<00:03:52.050> throw<00:03:52.260> them<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> pool<00:03:52.830> they<00:03:53.550> seem

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
she'll throw them in the pool they seem

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.250 
she'll throw them in the pool they seem
to<00:03:53.940> float<00:03:54.150> quite<00:03:54.390> well<00:03:54.630> but<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> don't<00:03:54.989> think

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
to float quite well but I don't think

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.960 
to float quite well but I don't think
they've<00:03:55.470> got<00:03:55.650> any<00:03:55.800> flotation<00:03:56.400> aids<00:03:56.519> inside

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
they've got any flotation aids inside

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.640 
they've got any flotation aids inside
them<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.390> I'm<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:57.930> sure<00:03:58.200> whether<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.440> pillow

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
them and I'm not sure whether the pillow

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.259 
them and I'm not sure whether the pillow
pets<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.070> developed<00:03:59.459> pillow<00:03:59.700> pets<00:04:00.000> for<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
pets have developed pillow pets for the

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.210 
pets have developed pillow pets for the
pool<00:04:00.480> maybe<00:04:01.200> they<00:04:01.410> have<00:04:01.590> maybe<00:04:01.830> they<00:04:02.040> haven't

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
pool maybe they have maybe they haven't

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.460 
pool maybe they have maybe they haven't
I<00:04:02.400> haven't<00:04:02.700> really<00:04:02.910> looked<00:04:03.030> around<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:03.750> deep

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
I haven't really looked around but deep

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.900 
I haven't really looked around but deep
in<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.739> back<00:04:04.860> of<00:04:04.980> my<00:04:05.070> mind<00:04:05.280> I'm<00:04:05.580> sort<00:04:05.850> of

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
in the back of my mind I'm sort of

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.610 
in the back of my mind I'm sort of
thinking<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.390> developing<00:04:06.870> quite<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.140> complex

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
thinking of developing quite a complex

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.350 
thinking of developing quite a complex
train<00:04:07.920> system<00:04:08.310> which<00:04:08.459> can<00:04:08.610> flood<00:04:08.910> on<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> pool

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
train system which can flood on the pool

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.940 
train system which can flood on the pool
and<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:10.110> know<00:04:10.230> what<00:04:10.350> I'm<00:04:10.440> thinking<00:04:10.739> back<00:04:10.920> to

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
and you know what I'm thinking back to

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.620 
and you know what I'm thinking back to
when<00:04:11.160> my<00:04:11.310> daughter<00:04:11.610> learned<00:04:11.880> how<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.030> swim<00:04:12.360> and

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
when my daughter learned how to swim and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.990 
when my daughter learned how to swim and
I<00:04:12.750> do<00:04:12.810> remember<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.890> teachers<00:04:14.400> using<00:04:14.610> little

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
I do remember the teachers using little

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.479 
I do remember the teachers using little
toys<00:04:15.209> as<00:04:15.709> incentives<00:04:16.709> for<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.010> children<00:04:17.340> to

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
toys as incentives for the children to

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.699 
toys as incentives for the children to
get<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.910> water<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.269> basically<00:04:18.660> swim<00:04:19.079> at

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
get in the water and basically swim at

get in the water and basically swim at
