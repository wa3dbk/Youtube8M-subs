00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
aren't really good things like the the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
or something like that they just suck

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
or something like that they just suck
they're<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.799> good<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.159> any<00:01:38.310> scenario<00:01:38.490> if

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
they're just not good in any scenario if

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.270 
they're just not good in any scenario if
somebody<00:01:39.090> has<00:01:39.650> practically<00:01:40.650> any<00:01:40.920> primary

weapon they're just going to completely

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
weapon they're just going to completely
out<00:01:43.140> class<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.159> just

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
out class you're not gonna you it's just

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
out class you're not gonna you it's just
not<00:01:44.579> fair<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.060> those<00:01:45.210> guns<00:01:45.450> definitely<00:01:46.200> need

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
not fair so those guns definitely need

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
not fair so those guns definitely need
more<00:01:46.380> range<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:47.040> damage<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> but

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
more range more damage more and but

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
more range more damage more and but
whatever<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.390> give<00:01:48.600> them<00:01:48.780> give<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
whatever you can give them give it to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
whatever you can give them give it to
him<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> pistols<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.670> need<00:01:50.880> help

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
him because of pistols they need help

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.700 
him because of pistols they need help
and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.420> also<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> crossbow<00:01:52.170> obviously

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and then also the crossbow obviously

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
and then also the crossbow obviously
that's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> special<00:01:53.610> weapon<00:01:53.880> considered<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that's a special weapon considered a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.609 
that's a special weapon considered a
secondary<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.170> primary<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.670> sucks<00:01:57.060> man

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
secondary or primary it just sucks man

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.249 
secondary or primary it just sucks man
it's<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.890> good<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.520> doesn't<00:01:59.729> i<00:02:00.030> mean<00:02:00.229> what<00:02:01.229> i

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it's not good it doesn't i mean what i

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's not good it doesn't i mean what i
would<00:02:01.439> think<00:02:01.649> they're<00:02:01.860> gonna<00:02:01.950> buff<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
would think they're gonna buff on it

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.800 
would think they're gonna buff on it
because<00:02:02.759> again<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.180> all<00:02:03.390> buffs<00:02:03.600> i

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
because again these are all buffs i

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
because again these are all buffs i
would<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.439> there<00:02:04.680> he<00:02:05.009> also<00:02:05.159> didn't<00:02:05.460> list

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
would think there he also didn't list

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.130 
would think there he also didn't list
that<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:05.939> could<00:02:06.090> also<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.329> all<00:02:06.540> nerves<00:02:06.840> but

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that there could also be all nerves but

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
that there could also be all nerves but
or<00:02:07.350> any<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.710> nurse<00:02:07.920> i<00:02:08.129> think<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> could

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
or any other nurse i think it could

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.309 
or any other nurse i think it could
actually<00:02:09.330> add<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:09.840> bit<00:02:09.989> more<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.200> an

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
actually add a little bit more of an

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
actually add a little bit more of an
explosive<00:02:11.160> radius<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> little<00:02:11.910> bit<00:02:12.060> more

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
explosive radius do a little bit more

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.610 
explosive radius do a little bit more
damage<00:02:12.510> maybe<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:13.200> even

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
damage maybe have even

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960 
damage maybe have even
like<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> stronger<00:02:14.250> bolt<00:02:14.549> that<00:02:14.730> could<00:02:14.879> go

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
like a stronger bolt that could go

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.460 
like a stronger bolt that could go
further<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.780> would<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:15.989> really<00:02:16.170> cool<00:02:16.290> I

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
further that would be really cool I

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.570 
further that would be really cool I
think<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:16.860> kind<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.069> what<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.310> needs<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
think that's kind of what it needs to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.390 
think that's kind of what it needs to
the<00:02:18.450> MP<00:02:18.750> 11<00:02:19.110> again<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.590> doesn't<00:02:19.739> class<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.250> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the MP 11 again it doesn't class up to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.729 
the MP 11 again it doesn't class up to
things<00:02:20.640> like<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.180> ASM<00:02:21.569> one<00:02:21.720> even<00:02:22.019> nearly<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.709> I

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
things like the ASM one even nearly so I

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.960 
things like the ASM one even nearly so I
think<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.010> could<00:02:23.190> use<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> little<00:02:23.549> bit<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.879> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
think that could use a little bit in the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.729 
think that could use a little bit in the
single<00:02:24.269> sack<00:02:24.420> three<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.750> practically<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
single sack three is practically the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.960 
single sack three is practically the
md-11<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.310> believe<00:02:26.489> it's<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> exact<00:02:26.940> same

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
md-11 I believe it's the exact same

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.630 
md-11 I believe it's the exact same
stats<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.750> way<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.140> plays<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.950> obviously

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
stats in the way it plays so obviously

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.860 
stats in the way it plays so obviously
that<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.970> use<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> little<00:02:30.329> bit<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> an<00:02:30.599> update

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
that can use a little bit of an update

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.729 
that can use a little bit of an update
because<00:02:30.959> they're<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.409> great<00:02:31.560> i<00:02:31.680> mean

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
because they're not that great i mean

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.410 
because they're not that great i mean
it's<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.069> bad<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.940> definitely<00:02:33.120> could<00:02:33.360> use

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's not bad but it definitely could use

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390 
it's not bad but it definitely could use
an<00:02:33.599> update<00:02:33.870> none<00:02:34.049> of<00:02:34.140> Moore's<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.890> Moors<00:02:35.159> gets

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
an update none of Moore's the Moors gets

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.740 
an update none of Moore's the Moors gets
me<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.579> little<00:02:35.700> bit<00:02:35.879> confused<00:02:36.299> amours<00:02:36.599> is

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
me a little bit confused amours is

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
me a little bit confused amours is
really<00:02:36.989> good<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:38.069> game

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
really good it's actually what this game

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
DLC but the Moors it's good the majority

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.280 
DLC but the Moors it's good the majority

of time you guys will see me get some
hit<00:02:46.440> markers<00:02:46.739> in<00:02:46.859> this<00:02:46.980> gameplay<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.519> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
hit markers in this gameplay but the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
hit markers in this gameplay but the
majority<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> time<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.870> does<00:02:49.049> get<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.260> one

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
majority of the time it does get a one

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.750 
majority of the time it does get a one
hit<00:02:49.620> kill<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.069> don't<00:02:50.280> think<00:02:50.489> that's<00:02:50.579> what

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
hit kill but I don't think that's what

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160 
hit kill but I don't think that's what
he's<00:02:50.849> talking<00:02:51.180> about<00:02:51.209> buffing<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.870> think<00:02:52.079> he's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
he's talking about buffing I think he's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.900 
he's talking about buffing I think he's
actually<00:02:52.319> talking<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:52.859> buffing<00:02:53.310> uh<00:02:53.430> like

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
actually talking about buffing uh like

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.339 
actually talking about buffing uh like
the<00:02:54.060> reload<00:02:54.420> time<00:02:54.450> where<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.870> shoot<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
the reload time where you shoot it and

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.449 
the reload time where you shoot it and
then<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.709> put<00:02:55.859> another<00:02:56.040> bullet<00:02:56.250> in

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
then you have to put another bullet in

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.530 
then you have to put another bullet in
because<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.819> never<00:02:56.879> run<00:02:57.060> out<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.239> ammo

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
because you can never run out of ammo

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.759 
because you can never run out of ammo
because<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.900> one-shot<00:02:58.079> clip<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
because it's a one-shot clip but you

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.830 
because it's a one-shot clip but you
have<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.040> 20<00:02:59.340> bullets<00:02:59.549> in<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.849> at<00:03:00.150> least<00:03:00.209> or

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
have like 20 bullets in it at least or

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.089 
have like 20 bullets in it at least or
20<00:03:01.049> volts<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.409> your<00:03:01.530> head<00:03:01.650> or<00:03:01.680> whatever<00:03:01.950> you

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
20 volts on your head or whatever you

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.009 
20 volts on your head or whatever you
want<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.310> call<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.519> in<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> inventory<00:03:03.019> that

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
want to call it in the inventory that

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.110 
want to call it in the inventory that
you<00:03:04.109> can<00:03:04.260> just<00:03:04.409> put<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.609> basically

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you can just put in and it's basically

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.699 
you can just put in and it's basically
forever<00:03:06.540> feeding<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.409> keep<00:03:07.560> on

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
forever feeding like you can keep on

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.020 
forever feeding like you can keep on
going<00:03:07.950> without<00:03:08.129> having<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> reload<00:03:08.700> your<00:03:08.730> clip

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
going without having to reload your clip

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.099 
going without having to reload your clip
which<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.239> pretty<00:03:09.359> cool<00:03:09.569> but<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.780> think<00:03:09.989> they're

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
which is pretty cool but I think they're

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.599 
which is pretty cool but I think they're
gonna<00:03:10.260> probably<00:03:10.620> try<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.069> speed<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.400> that

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
gonna probably try and speed up that

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.949 
gonna probably try and speed up that
time<00:03:11.849> which<00:03:12.030> wouldn't<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.510> bad<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.870> know

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
time which wouldn't be bad you know

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.210 
time which wouldn't be bad you know
that'd<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.200> nice<00:03:13.319> for<00:03:13.590> people<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> snipe

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
that'd be nice for people like to snipe

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.710 
that'd be nice for people like to snipe
blonde<00:03:14.489> advanced<00:03:14.760> warfare<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.299> slap<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.569> little

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
blonde advanced warfare I slap a little

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.970 
blonde advanced warfare I slap a little
bit<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:15.989> don't<00:03:16.200> sign<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.530> much<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:16.920> do

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
bit I don't sign it that much but I do

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.500 
bit I don't sign it that much but I do
have<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> doctor<00:03:17.669> which<00:03:17.819> actually<00:03:18.000> speeds<00:03:18.419> it

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
have the doctor which actually speeds it

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
have the doctor which actually speeds it
up<00:03:18.569> quite<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.840> bit<00:03:19.079> maybe<00:03:19.739> they<00:03:19.919> could<00:03:20.040> increase

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
up quite a bit maybe they could increase

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800 
up quite a bit maybe they could increase
the<00:03:20.340> damage<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.849> practically<00:03:21.389> never<00:03:21.540> get

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
the damage so you practically never get

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.539 
the damage so you practically never get
a<00:03:22.019> hit<00:03:22.530> mark<00:03:22.739> or<00:03:22.859> anything<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.340> or

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
a hit mark or anything like that or

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.190 
a hit mark or anything like that or
maybe<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:23.910> could<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.299> increase<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> 80s

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
maybe they could like increase the 80s

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.629 
maybe they could like increase the 80s
time<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.620> make<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:25.980> little<00:03:26.099> bit<00:03:26.280> easier<00:03:26.430> for

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
time to make it a little bit easier for

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.860 
time to make it a little bit easier for
people<00:03:26.880> like<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> quick<00:03:27.419> soap<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.750> know<00:03:27.840> I

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
people like the quick soap you know I

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.569 
people like the quick soap you know I
myself<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.530> I'm<00:03:28.590> sniping<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.099> like<00:03:29.459> to

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
myself and I'm sniping I like to

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.740 
myself and I'm sniping I like to
quickscope<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.120> that'd<00:03:30.239> be<00:03:30.359> really<00:03:30.480> cool<00:03:30.569> I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
quickscope so that'd be really cool I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.670 
quickscope so that'd be really cool I
think<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.079> probably<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:31.500> they're<00:03:31.590> going

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
think that's probably what they're going

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.869 
think that's probably what they're going
to<00:03:31.739> do<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.010> Moors<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.310> probably<00:03:32.730> add<00:03:32.849> more

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
to do the Moors and probably add more

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.490 
to do the Moors and probably add more
range<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.389> damage<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> MP<00:03:34.079> 11<00:03:34.349> in<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
range of damage to the MP 11 in the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.110 
range of damage to the MP 11 in the
single<00:03:34.769> sack<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.280> hopefully<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.000> guys

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
single sack so hopefully you guys

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000 
single sack so hopefully you guys
enjoyed<00:03:36.599> again<00:03:36.840> leaving<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.440> or<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> thumbs

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
enjoyed again leaving a like or a thumbs

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.319 
enjoyed again leaving a like or a thumbs

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
high for that that's definitely a debate

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.309 
high for that that's definitely a debate
basically<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.629> best<00:03:45.750> see<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.169> most
