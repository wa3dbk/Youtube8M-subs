00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
so far about the only thing I can

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.500

a<00:03:29.540> little<00:03:29.719> too<00:03:29.930> high

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
a little too high

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.179 
a little too high
other<00:03:31.879> than<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.390> thing<00:03:32.689> is<00:03:33.189> just

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
other than that this thing is just

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.729 
other than that this thing is just
ridiculous<00:03:34.819> I<00:03:35.269> don't<00:03:35.540> even<00:03:35.659> know<00:03:36.049> how<00:03:36.260> fast<00:03:36.530> it

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
ridiculous I don't even know how fast it

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.250 
ridiculous I don't even know how fast it
goes<00:03:36.889> I'm<00:03:37.700> almost<00:03:37.969> afraid<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.329> GPS<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.079> because

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
goes I'm almost afraid to GPS it because

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.289 
goes I'm almost afraid to GPS it because
I'll<00:03:39.590> probably<00:03:39.829> lose<00:03:40.129> control<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:40.760> die<00:03:40.969> I'm

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
I'll probably lose control and die I'm

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.670 
I'll probably lose control and die I'm
guessing<00:03:41.689> it's<00:03:41.840> probably<00:03:41.900> somewhere<00:03:42.530> around

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
guessing it's probably somewhere around

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.369 
guessing it's probably somewhere around
