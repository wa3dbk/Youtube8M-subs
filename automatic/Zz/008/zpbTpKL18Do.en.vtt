00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 johann and welcome here too 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.390
 a new fashion show on the dtv 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.130
 This time I have a new motto 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.330
 chosen and then becomes century 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.099
 probably also a new fashion 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.049
 bring out the idea and that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.309
 Agricultural video comes today or is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 probably already outside if this 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.800
 video now comes yes i go in once 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.949
 the dealer - and we can see that already 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.840
 under placebo objects the sawmill times 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 again from maru a really very very 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 Good morning, this one too 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 Video will praise again because he builds 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.520
 really with the hottest 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.120
 mods that exist at all so we see 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.730
 The sawmill costs 250,000 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.469
 Entertainment costs amount to 275 euros on 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 day and we own one or one 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.450
 have bought so this is a place here 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 bares sawmill from the holzstÃ¤mme well 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.440
 that it actually explains by itself 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.770
 understands exactly how we see it once 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.680
 I already wanted to stay here several times 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 Deploy the tank with a tree 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 and every time I'm too close 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.479
 he has already driven the trees 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.400
 recorded as we see there 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.930
 to me me, these trees now 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.860
 We just go down sometimes 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.860
 Of course, today does not work 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:27.170
 so if I say now we do 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:31.250
 not that , we just live it 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 and then they will be here on the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.310
 stack of course stored as 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.549
 very professional like me here 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.549
 make 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700
 up 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 it may not be full right now 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.800
 We see a very nice one 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:58.340
 sawmill here is the conveyor belt there 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.830
 then come the tree trunks purely then 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.680
 you can come here here sawdust 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:11.350
 out and we come out behind consultant 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:16.250
 the way it looks 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.500
 I did not want that exactly 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.990
 In any case, you have to be cool 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.170
 Of course, pay attention to the placement 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.970
 that is that here really well 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.260
 Of course, that's a bit on the ground 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.160
 Annoying but I did not want to go that far 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.670
 drive yes for a texture I like it 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.520
 good in any case 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.830
 either I'm doing something wrong like that 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.920
 raw materials fuels wood voice 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.140
 hamburg you can start somewhere 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.080
 So here you can this table it 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.019
 I would be interested in going now 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:01.489
 because nothing happens here 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:03.410
 Here were some functions I see 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.660
 that's the thing in the middle of the series 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.190
 but it really does happen 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.700
 nothing here I have to vacate the only way 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.700
 it can not be 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.470
 that would of course be interesting now 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.470
 to know 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.519
 but I have not overlooked anything here 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.040
 just write the comments 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.799
 maybe you know how it works 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.180
 and then we'll see each other in a new one 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:43.510
 video again today even at agrar de 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.579
 and if and until next time so 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.340
 I just found out that 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.799
 This sawmill can be clocked in five minutes 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.159
 runs because of the performance and stuff like that 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.359
 standard at least on motto oster and 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:01.030
 then that would already be the case 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:03.909
 reason but somehow probably goes 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.159
 this is not the honest one 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.859
 real five minutes and not on the 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.060
 ingame five minutes I just see because 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.670
 I have the time very much too 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.260
 really fast happened there 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.109
 nothing like I just very 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.430
 Well then I have you that at least 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.810
 what is not said in the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.010
 Write comments and see you 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.010
 in a new fashion presentation 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.939
 you go
