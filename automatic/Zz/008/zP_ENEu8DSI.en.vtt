 Skub'ev 5 for this size 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.349
 You can find this comparison on 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.179

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.289
 a little closer 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.479
 sneakers 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.399
 plastic part called sprint 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.789
 frame 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.249
 she goes 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.789
 across the surface 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.379
 to heel 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.379
 inside it creates stiffness 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.930
 flexible front 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.079
 back of the canvas 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.299
 I 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.030
 premium these sneakers 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.759
 they are a little small 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.389
 Egyptian 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.999
 it seems to me rather narrow that is 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.969
 plastic element 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.429
 will need 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:13.969
 to win 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.030

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:18.829

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.549
 than they resemble a nike zoom house 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.949

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.689
 front end

 st dawn probe 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.539
 but the comparison is of course incorrect 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.819
 so this region 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.819
 forgot to say what technology is like 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.429
