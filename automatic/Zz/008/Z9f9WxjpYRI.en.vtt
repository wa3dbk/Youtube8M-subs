 the question allows us to be below the 2010 South Africa World Cup 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.769
 because we know that no 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.240
 we have developed a plan that you can never refuse 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.720
 when your brand starts to come out for the three councilors more than rock 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.180
 sanctify will grow bigger and fly through the air to land on the radio 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.280
 of a person 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.580
 who feels that what he is hearing 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.160
 He calls us to tell us what is happening to his head and in his heart 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.360
 that link in that sense of faults 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360

 that's why in Iberoamericana radio chile we are preparing to travel to 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 World Cup of South Africa 2010 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.840

 interesting thing about all this french that radio union will deploy a network of 40 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.730
 journalists in total counting ours to tackle the global and every 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.690
 one of its venues as it corresponds with the objective of obtaining information of 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.460

 halfway from one place to another 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:28.049
 and a television is a bit inconvenient to travel by metro in the transantiago 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.859
 or the car is true 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.830
