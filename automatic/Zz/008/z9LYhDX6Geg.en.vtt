00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
YouTube channels and I know that a lot

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.939 
YouTube channels and I know that a lot
of<00:00:23.250> people<00:00:23.519> use<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.140> mini<00:00:25.740> candles<00:00:27.619> this<00:00:28.619> size

they buy them as tarts to use ask tarts
and<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:34.140> thought<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.040> that's<00:00:35.160> originally

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and I thought that that's originally

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
and I thought that that's originally
what<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.620> doing<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.280> but

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
what I was going to be doing with it but

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
what I was going to be doing with it but
then<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.000> actually<00:00:39.329> found<00:00:39.780> something<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.980> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
then I actually found something that I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.369 
then I actually found something that I
personally<00:00:41.820> liked<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.719> bit<00:00:42.899> better<00:00:43.399> so

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
personally liked a little bit better so

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.600 
personally liked a little bit better so
through<00:00:46.379> trial<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> error<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.190> tried<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> few

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.720 
through trial and error I tried a few
different<00:00:47.820> things<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.250> one<00:00:50.250> thing<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.489> I've

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

I'm just going to show you how I've been

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.550 
I'm just going to show you how I've been
doing<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.570> I've<00:02:20.750> been<00:02:20.780> doing<00:02:21.230> is

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
doing that so what I've been doing is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.900 
doing that so what I've been doing is
I've<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.450> been<00:02:23.450> kind<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.080> scraping<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:25.670> wax

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
I've just been kind of scraping the wax

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.230 
I've just been kind of scraping the wax
out<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.810> bottom<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.860> literally<00:02:28.520> just

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
out of the bottom so you literally just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.900 
out of the bottom so you literally just
I'm<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.780> taking<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.500> spoon<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.700> just

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
I'm just taking a spoon and you're just

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.330 
I'm just taking a spoon and you're just
kind<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.270> getting<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.750> little<00:02:32.780> bit<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.500> then

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
kind of getting a little bit and then

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.450 
kind of getting a little bit and then
you're<00:02:34.940> putting<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.540> into<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:37.100> tart<00:02:37.340> ware<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
you're putting it into the tart ware and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.580 
you're putting it into the tart ware and
then<00:02:40.460> that's<00:02:41.000> how<00:02:41.150> I've<00:02:41.450> been<00:02:41.660> using<00:02:41.960> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
then that's how I've been using the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.770 
then that's how I've been using the
leftover<00:02:42.920> wax<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.570> really

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
leftover wax and so this is a really

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.500 
leftover wax and so this is a really
great<00:02:44.990> method<00:02:45.410> because<00:02:45.820> otherwise<00:02:46.820> what<00:02:47.390> I'd

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
great method because otherwise what I'd

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.210 
great method because otherwise what I'd
been<00:02:47.690> doing<00:02:47.990> is<00:02:48.170> I've<00:02:48.380> literally<00:02:48.710> just<00:02:48.830> been

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
been doing is I've literally just been

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.150 
been doing is I've literally just been
throwing<00:02:49.580> away<00:02:49.820> all<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.270> extra<00:02:50.600> wax<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.830> I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
throwing away all this extra wax and I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.770 
throwing away all this extra wax and I
did<00:02:52.370> buy<00:02:52.520> like<00:02:52.760> wicks<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.270> stuff<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.750> was

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
did buy like wicks and stuff and I was

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.260 
did buy like wicks and stuff and I was
gonna<00:02:54.110> actually<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:55.370> know<00:02:55.490> put<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
gonna actually you know put this on the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.540 
gonna actually you know put this on the
stove<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.660> melt<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.990> down<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.200> make<00:02:57.550> candles

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
stove and melt it down and make candles

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.510 
stove and melt it down and make candles
out<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.880> leftover<00:02:59.180> wax<00:02:59.500> but<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.770> just<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.220> felt

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
out of leftover wax but it just it felt

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.970 
out of leftover wax but it just it felt
like<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.670> lot<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.030> work<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:03.500> wasn't<00:03:03.680> even

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
like a lot of work and it wasn't even

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.500 
like a lot of work and it wasn't even
sure<00:03:04.010> if<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.310> was<00:03:04.370> gonna<00:03:04.460> be<00:03:04.670> successful<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.450> I

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
sure if it was gonna be successful and I

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.140 
sure if it was gonna be successful and I
just<00:03:05.750> never<00:03:05.870> ended<00:03:06.290> up<00:03:06.410> doing<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.820> I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
just never ended up doing it so I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.600 
just never ended up doing it so I
started<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.810> try<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.160> ended<00:03:10.460> up

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
started to try this and it ended up

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.630 
started to try this and it ended up
working<00:03:11.090> out<00:03:11.480> really<00:03:11.900> great<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.560> I'm<00:03:13.340> glad<00:03:13.550> I

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
working out really great so I'm glad I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.070 
working out really great so I'm glad I
found<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.900> method<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.300> really<00:03:17.690> like<00:03:17.870> it

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
found this method so I really like it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.810 
found this method so I really like it
the<00:03:18.260> one<00:03:18.500> thing<00:03:18.739> though<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.610> aren't

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
the one thing though that you aren't

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.420 
the one thing though that you aren't
gonna<00:03:19.940> get<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.390> your<00:03:21.080> throw<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.860> not<00:03:22.100> gonna<00:03:22.250> be

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
gonna get is your throw is not gonna be

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.490 
gonna get is your throw is not gonna be
as<00:03:22.550> strong<00:03:22.820> as<00:03:23.150> if<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.600> had<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> candle<00:03:24.320> burning

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
as strong as if you had a candle burning

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.420 
as strong as if you had a candle burning
and<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:26.540> really<00:03:27.080> really<00:03:27.320> liked<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.860> pumpkin

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
and I really really liked this pumpkin

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.290 
and I really really liked this pumpkin
burner<00:03:28.640> because<00:03:29.360> it's<00:03:29.870> absolutely<00:03:30.590> adorable

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
burner because it's absolutely adorable

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.870 
burner because it's absolutely adorable
and<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:33.080> nice<00:03:33.380> thing<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.459> doesn't<00:03:34.820> get

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
and a nice thing is that it doesn't get

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.330 
and a nice thing is that it doesn't get
super<00:03:35.300> super<00:03:35.450> hot<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.110> can<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:37.010> know<00:03:37.130> have

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
super super hot so I can you know have

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.910 
super super hot so I can you know have
my<00:03:37.580> hand<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.420> know<00:03:38.540> right<00:03:39.020> on<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.800> I'm

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
my hand you know right on this and I'm

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.830 
my hand you know right on this and I'm
holding<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.370> on<00:03:40.580> here<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.600> know<00:03:41.690> my

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
holding this on here and you know my

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.810 
holding this on here and you know my
hand<00:03:42.050> isn't<00:03:42.350> burning<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.370> know<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.670> just

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
hand isn't burning it's you know it just

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.690 
hand isn't burning it's you know it just
feels<00:03:44.140> slightly<00:03:45.140> warm<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.620> touch<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.400> that's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
feels slightly warm to touch so that's

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.490 
feels slightly warm to touch so that's
one<00:03:46.970> nice<00:03:47.150> thing<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:47.989> not<00:03:48.080> really<00:03:48.380> a

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
one nice thing is that it's not really a

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.340 
one nice thing is that it's not really a
safety<00:03:49.070> hazard<00:03:49.280> one<00:03:49.850> thing<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.200> don't

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
safety hazard one thing that I don't

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.540 
safety hazard one thing that I don't
like<00:03:51.770> is<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.970> cover<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.900> think<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.860> for<00:03:55.220> when

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
like is the cover I think that for when

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.130 
like is the cover I think that for when
you're<00:03:55.760> trying<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.120> warm<00:03:56.450> up<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.720> wax<00:03:56.900> like

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
you're trying to warm up the wax like

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.949 
you're trying to warm up the wax like
right<00:03:57.380> now<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:57.950> put<00:03:58.160> in<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:59.030> extra<00:03:59.420> wax

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
right now I just put in the extra wax

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.170 
right now I just put in the extra wax
and<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.590> hasn't<00:04:00.830> completely<00:04:01.100> melted<00:04:01.760> yet<00:04:01.910> I

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and it hasn't completely melted yet I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.150 
and it hasn't completely melted yet I
think<00:04:02.750> having<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.290> cover<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.950> great

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
think having the cover on is great

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.460 
think having the cover on is great
because<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:05.420> know<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.540> really<00:04:05.810> keeps<00:04:06.170> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
because it you know it really keeps the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.020 
because it you know it really keeps the
heat<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.700> warmer<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:09.440> only<00:04:09.890> problem<00:04:10.400> is

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
heat in the warmer the only problem is

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.550 
heat in the warmer the only problem is
that<00:04:11.860> then<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.519> scent<00:04:13.820> doesn't<00:04:14.320> disperse<00:04:15.320> as

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
that then the scent doesn't disperse as

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.819 
that then the scent doesn't disperse as
much<00:04:15.770> so<00:04:16.539> what<00:04:17.539> I<00:04:17.600> mean<00:04:17.870> by<00:04:18.020> that<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.410> that

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
much so what I mean by that is that

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.979 
much so what I mean by that is that
the<00:04:19.280> cover<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.639> actually<00:04:20.150> keeping<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.659> scent

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
the cover is actually keeping the scent

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.279 
the cover is actually keeping the scent
in<00:04:21.139> so<00:04:21.829> what<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.250> do<00:04:22.340> after<00:04:22.940> it's<00:04:23.449> heated<00:04:23.840> up<00:04:24.080> is

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
in so what I do after it's heated up is

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.920 
in so what I do after it's heated up is
I<00:04:24.470> just<00:04:24.530> kind<00:04:24.889> of<00:04:24.979> take<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.550> cover<00:04:25.819> off<00:04:25.909> and<00:04:26.419> I

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
I just kind of take the cover off and I

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.890 
I just kind of take the cover off and I
leave<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.259> off<00:04:27.530> but<00:04:28.039> then<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.550> don't<00:04:29.509> know<00:04:29.569> it's

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
leave it off but then I don't know it's

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.670 
leave it off but then I don't know it's
not<00:04:30.110> as<00:04:30.289> cute<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:31.389> that's<00:04:32.389> one<00:04:32.840> thing<00:04:33.229> that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.420 
not as cute so that's one thing that
does<00:04:34.370> kind<00:04:34.639> of<00:04:34.729> annoy<00:04:35.000> me<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:37.220> like

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:30.219 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.969 

so<00:05:31.219> literally<00:05:32.060> that's<00:05:32.449> as<00:05:33.259> long<00:05:33.650> as<00:05:33.830> the

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
so literally that's as long as the

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.249 
so literally that's as long as the
cordis<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.610> know<00:05:34.699> it<00:05:34.969> probably<00:05:35.180> looks<00:05:35.690> longer

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
cordis I know it probably looks longer

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.510 
cordis I know it probably looks longer
in<00:05:36.500> camera<00:05:36.979> but<00:05:37.610> it's<00:05:37.789> literally<00:05:38.599> like<00:05:39.289> a<00:05:39.800> foot

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
in camera but it's literally like a foot

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.689 
in camera but it's literally like a foot
and<00:05:40.759> a<00:05:40.880> half<00:05:41.120> maybe<00:05:41.740> so<00:05:42.770> it's<00:05:43.099> really<00:05:43.460> really

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
and a half maybe so it's really really

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.870 
and a half maybe so it's really really
short<00:05:43.849> and<00:05:44.919> it's<00:05:45.919> pretty<00:05:46.310> annoying<00:05:46.550> because

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
short and it's pretty annoying because

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.939 
short and it's pretty annoying because
it's<00:05:47.180> destroyed<00:05:48.009> but<00:05:50.020> anyways<00:05:51.020> I<00:05:51.500> think<00:05:51.650> that

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
it's destroyed but anyways I think that

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.219 
it's destroyed but anyways I think that
