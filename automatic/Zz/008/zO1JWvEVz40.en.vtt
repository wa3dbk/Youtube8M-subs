00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
look at ya okay so the reason why we do

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.350 
look at ya okay so the reason why we do
that<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.190> because<00:01:12.759> if<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:13.060> was<00:01:13.210> in<00:01:13.330> the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
that is so that because if it was in the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.690 
that is so that because if it was in the
trachea<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.619> would<00:01:14.770> be<00:01:14.920> in<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.130> hollow<00:01:15.369> tube

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
trachea it would be in a hollow tube

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.029 
trachea it would be in a hollow tube
that's<00:01:16.240> surrounded<00:01:16.690> by<00:01:16.780> cartilage<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.890> would

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
that's surrounded by cartilage you would

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.180 
that's surrounded by cartilage you would
never<00:01:18.220> see<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.229> seeing<00:01:20.679> is<00:01:20.890> one

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
never see it and so the seeing is one

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.340 
never see it and so the seeing is one
thing<00:01:21.520> not<00:01:22.090> all<00:01:22.300> horses<00:01:22.479> can<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.929> see<00:01:23.080> it's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
thing not all horses can you see it's

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.290 
thing not all horses can you see it's
depending<00:01:23.679> on<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.830> hair<00:01:24.039> or<00:01:24.250> whatnot<00:01:24.490> the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
depending on the hair or whatnot the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.510 
depending on the hair or whatnot the
other<00:01:25.450> thing<00:01:25.659> we<00:01:25.750> do<00:01:25.929> is<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.259> feel<00:01:26.590> for<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.130> it's

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
other thing we do is we feel for it it's

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.809 
other thing we do is we feel for it it's
just<00:01:27.729> resistance<00:01:28.450> right<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:29.289> in<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.440> hollow

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
just resistance right it's in a hollow

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.419 
just resistance right it's in a hollow
trachea<00:01:30.819> just<00:01:31.270> be<00:01:31.509> like<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.750> violin<00:01:32.289> it's<00:01:33.130> been

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
trachea just be like a violin it's been

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.690 
trachea just be like a violin it's been
going<00:01:33.640> real<00:01:33.880> easy<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:35.319> I<00:01:35.380> can<00:01:35.590> feel<00:01:35.770> resistance

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.730 

that<00:01:39.700> go<00:01:39.909> that<00:01:40.360> went<00:01:40.539> on<00:01:40.659> me<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.840> good<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.110> go

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
hold I had just grabbe's one fluid

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:49.339 
hold I had just grabbe's one fluid
different<00:03:40.829> batch<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.510> then<00:03:48.660> I'll<00:03:48.870> take<00:03:49.319> it

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
different batch so and then I'll take it

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.319 
different batch so and then I'll take it
to<00:03:49.650> boost<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.099> minute<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.639> flip<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:50.940> back<00:03:51.150> to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
to boost a minute and flip it back to

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.150 
to boost a minute and flip it back to
you<00:03:51.480> screen<00:03:52.319> check<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.680> make<00:03:52.799> sure<00:03:52.859> if<00:03:53.040> you're

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
you screen check to make sure if you're

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.789 
you screen check to make sure if you're
going<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> refill<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.989> if<00:03:55.440> she's<00:03:55.590> back

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
going to refill you know if she's back

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.550 
going to refill you know if she's back
all<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> way<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.340> at<00:03:56.459> their<00:03:56.579> stomach<00:03:57.060> and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
all the way up at their stomach and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.699 
all the way up at their stomach and
often<00:03:58.560> will<00:03:58.739> get<00:03:59.000> the<00:04:00.000> fluid<00:04:00.480> rushing<00:04:00.959> out<00:04:01.139> at

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
often will get the fluid rushing out at

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.540 
often will get the fluid rushing out at
us

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
us
