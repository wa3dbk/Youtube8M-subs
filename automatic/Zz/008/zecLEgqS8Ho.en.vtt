00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
bunch of updates on this but I've been

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.929 
bunch of updates on this but I've been
kind<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.510> slow<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.439> okay<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.340> then

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
kind of going slow with it okay and then

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
kind of going slow with it okay and then
the<00:00:21.029> other<00:00:21.210> thing<00:00:21.539> I've<00:00:22.470> also<00:00:22.710> been<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the other thing I've also been kind of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120 
the other thing I've also been kind of
using<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> plant<00:00:24.539> hospital<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.859> far

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
using it as a plant hospital just so far

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
using it as a plant hospital just so far
because<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> ton<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> plants<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.720> one

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
because I have a ton of plants in one

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.550 
because I have a ton of plants in one
tank<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.609> I<00:00:29.609> accidentally<00:00:30.330> used<00:00:30.660> marine

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
tank and I accidentally used marine

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
tank and I accidentally used marine
bulbs<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.540> like<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.660> bought<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> marine

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
bulbs in there like I bought a marine

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
bulbs in there like I bought a marine
fixture<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> only<00:00:35.550> size<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
fixture because that was the only size I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.549 
fixture because that was the only size I
could<00:00:36.210> find<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.960> couldn't<00:00:37.170> find<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> for

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
could find it in I couldn't find it for

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
could find it in I couldn't find it for
fresh<00:00:37.890> water<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.340> forgot<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> change<00:00:38.969> out

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
fresh water and I forgot to change out

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790 
fresh water and I forgot to change out
the<00:00:39.329> bulbs<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.930> let<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.140> run<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> couple

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the bulbs and I let it run for a couple

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.180 
the bulbs and I let it run for a couple
months<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.870> algae<00:00:42.870> grew<00:00:43.140> rampant<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
months and algae grew rampant and I

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
months and algae grew rampant and I
basically<00:00:44.399> saved<00:00:44.969> moat<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.989> plants<00:00:46.440> but

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
basically saved moat all the plants but

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.680 
basically saved moat all the plants but
you<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.219> some<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.180> pretty<00:00:48.420> badly

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you know some of them are pretty badly

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.069 
you know some of them are pretty badly
damaged<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.370> them<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> tank<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
damaged so I have them in this tank you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.600 
damaged so I have them in this tank you
know<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> course<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> nice

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
know of course because it's got the nice

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
know of course because it's got the nice
plant<00:00:53.940> substrate<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.570> close<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> light<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
plant substrate very close to light you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.400 
plant substrate very close to light you
know<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:56.190> shallow<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.329> course<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.930> co2

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
know very shallow and of course the co2

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.889 
know very shallow and of course the co2
system<00:00:58.820> now<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> don't<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> co2<00:01:00.690> system

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
system now I don't have the co2 system

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
system now I don't have the co2 system
on<00:01:01.199> yet<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.750> kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.729> let

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
on yet because I kind of want to let

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.550 
on yet because I kind of want to let
things<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.540> acclimated<00:01:07.320> first

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
things get a little acclimated first

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020 
things get a little acclimated first
because<00:01:07.770> otherwise<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.490> it'll<00:01:08.850> land

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
because otherwise you know it'll land

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.310 
because otherwise you know it'll land
your<00:01:09.360> pH<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.530> low<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:12.049> I'm<00:01:13.049> kind

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
your pH a little low there so I'm kind

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
your pH a little low there so I'm kind
of<00:01:13.409> letting<00:01:13.560> things<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.070> acclimated<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of letting things get acclimated and I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
of letting things get acclimated and I
just<00:01:15.330> added<00:01:15.619> fish<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.070> only<00:01:17.220> going

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just added fish in there I'm only going

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
just added fish in there I'm only going
to<00:01:17.490> keep<00:01:17.820> Cardinal<00:01:18.330> tetras<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to keep Cardinal tetras in here as you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
to keep Cardinal tetras in here as you
can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.860> three<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.340> right

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
can see there's three of them right

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
can see there's three of them right
there<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:21.259> love<00:01:22.259> my<00:01:22.439> Cardinals<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:24.290> might<00:01:25.290> put<00:01:25.530> on

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there I love my Cardinals I might put on

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
there I love my Cardinals I might put on
auto<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.549> two<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.240> eat<00:01:27.390> algae<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
auto or two in there just eat algae if I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
auto or two in there just eat algae if I
have<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> problem<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.430> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
have the problem but I don't really have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.200 
have the problem but I don't really have
any<00:01:29.820> algae<00:01:30.240> problems<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.140> yet<00:01:31.590> okay<00:01:32.210> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
any algae problems in here yet okay I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
any algae problems in here yet okay I
probably<00:01:34.020> won't<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.799> light<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
probably won't because this light is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.520 
probably won't because this light is
like<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.540> looking<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
like a I was looking up it's like a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.289 
like a I was looking up it's like a
really<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:38.189> spectrum<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.090> really

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
really good spectrum and it's a really

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
really good spectrum and it's a really
good<00:01:39.600> color<00:01:40.110> temperature<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
good color temperature for this so I'm a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
good color temperature for this so I'm a
feeling<00:01:42.479> we're<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
feeling we're not going to have that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.580 
feeling we're not going to have that
problem<00:01:43.939> but<00:01:44.939> anyways<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.470> I've

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
problem but anyways so that's what I've

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.940 
problem but anyways so that's what I've

and I'll give you a few tips on this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560 
and I'll give you a few tips on this
incase<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.299> black

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
incase if you want to get one that black

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.969 
incase if you want to get one that black
thing<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.110> said<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.350> didn't<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:58.890> it

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
thing that I said I didn't know what it

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.730 
thing that I said I didn't know what it
was<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:01.259> black<00:02:01.469> thing

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
was if you see here now that black thing

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.819 
was if you see here now that black thing
I<00:02:02.100> guess<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.549> tank<00:02:02.969> man<00:02:03.240> okay<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.290> sits<00:02:04.619> right

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
I guess is a tank man okay it sits right

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.319 
I guess is a tank man okay it sits right
there<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> doesn't<00:02:05.490> completely<00:02:05.729> cover<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
there it doesn't completely cover the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.969 
there it doesn't completely cover the
tank<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.049> okay

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
tank but it's okay

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.680 
tank but it's okay
well<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.100> pretty<00:02:09.310> much<00:02:09.430> does<00:02:09.760> I<00:02:10.060> mean<00:02:10.119> it's

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
well it pretty much does I mean it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.820 
well it pretty much does I mean it's
just<00:02:10.780> not<00:02:11.260> quite<00:02:11.500> but<00:02:12.370> anyways<00:02:13.530> another<00:02:14.530> thing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
just not quite but anyways another thing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.370 
just not quite but anyways another thing
was<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:17.200> filter<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.930> doesn't<00:02:20.260> have

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
was the filter on here it doesn't have

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.160 
was the filter on here it doesn't have
any<00:02:20.560> carbon<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.400> sponges<00:02:21.940> okay<00:02:22.420> but

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
any carbon it's just sponges okay but

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.990 
any carbon it's just sponges okay but
there<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.650> room<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:23.920> improvement<00:02:24.190> in<00:02:24.820> there<00:02:24.970> I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
there is room for improvement in there I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.120 
there is room for improvement in there I
don't<00:02:25.120> know<00:02:25.210> if<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.540> see<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
don't know if you can see that but the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.220 
don't know if you can see that but the
shell<00:02:27.430> there's<00:02:27.700> room<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.480> shell<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> if

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
shell there's room in that shell and if

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.650 
shell there's room in that shell and if
you<00:02:29.380> take<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.770> foam<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.280> there's<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:31.060> mean

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
you take the foam out there's I mean

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.510 
you take the foam out there's I mean
really<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.410> put<00:02:32.590> whatever<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.950> want<00:02:33.040> in

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
really you can put whatever you want in

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.070 
really you can put whatever you want in
there<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.940> I'll<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.360> experimenting<00:02:35.140> with<00:02:35.290> that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
there so I'll be experimenting with that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.410 
there so I'll be experimenting with that
alright<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.220> filter<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:40.150> for

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
alright and that's the filter there for

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.240 
alright and that's the filter there for
you<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:40.960> got<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> adjustable<00:02:41.770> output<00:02:41.860> I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
you and it's got the adjustable output I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.680 
you and it's got the adjustable output I
don't<00:02:42.430> know<00:02:42.490> if<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.670> saw<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.570> video

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
don't know if you saw that in the video

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.080 
don't know if you saw that in the video
with<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.080> spray<00:02:44.440> bar<00:02:44.680> that's<00:02:45.550> what<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:45.820> using

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
with the spray bar that's what I'm using

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.470 
with the spray bar that's what I'm using
um<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:49.540> course<00:02:49.810> uh<00:02:51.330> everything<00:02:52.330> else

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
um and of course uh everything else

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600 
um and of course uh everything else
seems<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:52.990> working<00:02:53.380> fine<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.950> mean<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.490> is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
seems to be working fine I mean this is

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.040 
seems to be working fine I mean this is
the<00:02:54.790> filter<00:02:55.000> seems<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.540> working<00:02:55.870> fine

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
the filter seems to be working fine

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.630 
the filter seems to be working fine
obviously<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.680> fish<00:02:56.860> are<00:02:57.040> alive<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.490> there

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
obviously the fish are alive in there

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.370 
obviously the fish are alive in there
but<00:02:57.940> uh<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:58.960> just<00:02:59.050> how<00:02:59.200> am<00:02:59.260> I

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
but uh you know it's just how am I

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.800 
but uh you know it's just how am I
worried<00:02:59.590> about<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:01.240> probably<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
worried about and then probably the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.020 
worried about and then probably the
biggest<00:03:02.080> warning<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.920> will<00:03:03.220> give<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.610> about

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
biggest warning I will give you about

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.210 
biggest warning I will give you about
this<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.810> need<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.170> know<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.650> this

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
this that you need to know is this

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.150 
this that you need to know is this
stratum<00:03:06.850> right<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:07.440> first<00:03:08.440> off<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.860> stuff

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
stratum right here first off this stuff

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.700 
stratum right here first off this stuff
is<00:03:09.340> very<00:03:09.790> low<00:03:10.180> density<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.930> mean<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.320> was<00:03:11.440> hard

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
is very low density I mean it was hard

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.670 
is very low density I mean it was hard
to<00:03:11.770> bury<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.250> plants<00:03:12.989> though<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.739> was<00:03:15.280> just

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
to bury the plants though it was just

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.060 
to bury the plants though it was just
there<00:03:17.680> was<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.070> low<00:03:18.489> density<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
there was so low density that that the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.710 
there was so low density that that the
plants<00:03:21.430> just<00:03:21.550> wanted<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.030> keep<00:03:22.180> floating<00:03:22.480> up

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
plants just wanted to keep floating up

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720 
plants just wanted to keep floating up
it<00:03:22.900> was<00:03:22.989> really<00:03:23.320> hard<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.560> bury<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.310> fact

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it was really hard to bury it in fact

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.229 
it was really hard to bury it in fact
here<00:03:25.030> let<00:03:25.239> me<00:03:25.270> show<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.550> little<00:03:27.940> bit<00:03:28.090> what

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
gave it a flick and just a bunch of it

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.710 
gave it a flick and just a bunch of it
went<00:03:44.770> flying<00:03:44.980> up<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.610> mean<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.300> stuff<00:03:46.540> is

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
went flying up I mean the stuff is

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.740 
went flying up I mean the stuff is
really<00:03:47.350> like<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:48.459> even<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.850> little<00:03:48.880> mushy<00:03:49.330> too

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
really like it's even a little mushy too

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.410 
really like it's even a little mushy too
so<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.290> you're<00:03:50.850> putting<00:03:51.850> this<00:03:51.970> in<00:03:52.180> make<00:03:52.390> sure

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
so when you're putting this in make sure

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.690 
so when you're putting this in make sure
you<00:03:52.630> don't<00:03:52.750> squish<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.650> or<00:03:53.890> squeeze<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.519> bag

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
you don't squish it or squeeze the bag

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.420 
you don't squish it or squeeze the bag
or<00:03:55.060> anything<00:03:55.300> like<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.600> because<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.430> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
or anything like that because the the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.220 
or anything like that because the the
little<00:03:57.760> particles<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.510> little<00:03:58.810> pebbles

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
little particles the little pebbles

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.140 
little particles the little pebbles
there<00:03:59.500> will<00:03:59.769> actually<00:03:59.920> break<00:04:00.519> up<00:04:00.550> and<00:04:00.970> turn

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
there will actually break up and turn

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.740 
there will actually break up and turn
into<00:04:01.390> dust<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.019> then<00:04:02.260> okay<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:04.600> other

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
into dust and then okay and the other

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.190 
into dust and then okay and the other
thing<00:04:05.050> about<00:04:05.290> half<00:04:06.070> of<00:04:06.280> my<00:04:06.489> bag<00:04:06.790> at<00:04:07.060> least<00:04:07.269> was

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
thing about half of my bag at least was

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.920 
thing about half of my bag at least was
dust<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.830> had<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.690> rinsed<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:10.810> out

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
dust I had it like I rinsed it out

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.550 
dust I had it like I rinsed it out
slightly<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.739> one<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:13.260> fish<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.380> call

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
slightly and one of the fish you call

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.280 
slightly and one of the fish you call
them<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:15.489> strainer<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:16.239> calm<00:04:16.989> or

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
them the the strainer is calm or

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.200 
them the the strainer is calm or
whatever<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:17.799> call<00:04:18.010> them

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
whatever you call them

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.170 
whatever you call them
I<00:04:19.590> only<00:04:20.590> did<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.860> slightly<00:04:21.280> though<00:04:21.640> because<00:04:21.850> my

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
I only did it slightly though because my

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.150 
I only did it slightly though because my
holes<00:04:22.810> were<00:04:23.020> really<00:04:23.290> big<00:04:23.470> in<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.710> strainer<00:04:24.010> I

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
holes were really big in the strainer I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.960 
holes were really big in the strainer I
was<00:04:24.310> using<00:04:24.540> but<00:04:25.710> then<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.740> put<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.370> here<00:04:27.730> and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
was using but then I put it in here and

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.360 
was using but then I put it in here and
I<00:04:28.720> had<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:28.960> do<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> water<00:04:29.440> change<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:30.040> four

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
I had to do a water change like four

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.080 
I had to do a water change like four
times<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:31.450> finally<00:04:31.870> get<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.500> uh<00:04:33.090> settle

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
times to finally get it to uh settle

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.620 
times to finally get it to uh settle
down<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.640> one<00:04:36.640> thing<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:36.940> would<00:04:37.000> suggest<00:04:37.240> is

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
down so one thing I would suggest is

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.050 
down so one thing I would suggest is
maybe<00:04:37.660> if<00:04:38.230> you<00:04:38.380> have<00:04:38.650> leftover<00:04:39.340> plants

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
maybe if you have leftover plants

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.510 
maybe if you have leftover plants
substrate<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.750> says<00:04:41.380> not<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.620> mix<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.250> but

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
substrate it says not to mix it but

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.110 
substrate it says not to mix it but
there's<00:04:43.090> no<00:04:43.240> reason<00:04:43.600> why<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.780> can't<00:04:45.120> maybe

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
there's no reason why you can't maybe

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.240 
there's no reason why you can't maybe
even<00:04:46.450> put<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.960> down<00:04:47.170> here<00:04:47.440> or<00:04:47.620> order<00:04:48.040> another

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
even put it down here or order another

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.640 
even put it down here or order another
bag<00:04:48.520> of<00:04:48.550> strat<00:04:49.060> stratum<00:04:49.780> if<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.200> have<00:04:50.410> that

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
bag of strat stratum if you have that

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.180 
bag of strat stratum if you have that
problem

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
problem

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.150 
problem
as<00:04:52.090> you<00:04:52.390> can<00:04:52.540> see<00:04:52.780> mine's<00:04:53.050> probably<00:04:53.770> about<00:04:53.950> the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
as you can see mine's probably about the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.890 
as you can see mine's probably about the
bare<00:04:54.430> minimum<00:04:54.850> level<00:04:55.210> I'd<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.690> have

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
bare minimum level I'd like to have

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.750 
bare minimum level I'd like to have
maybe<00:04:56.290> like<00:04:56.740> another<00:04:57.810> half<00:04:58.810> inch<00:04:59.140> or<00:04:59.410> so

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
maybe like another half inch or so

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.040 
maybe like another half inch or so
coming<00:05:00.760> off<00:05:00.910> of<00:05:00.940> there<00:05:01.330> especially<00:05:01.660> since

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
coming off of there especially since

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.660 
coming off of there especially since
it's<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.350> plant<00:05:02.710> pretty<00:05:03.130> much<00:05:03.250> as<00:05:03.400> plant

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
it's a plant pretty much as plant

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.590 
it's a plant pretty much as plant
specialty<00:05:04.270> tank<00:05:04.510> I'd<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.020> have<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.200> lot<00:05:05.620> of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
specialty tank I'd like to have a lot of

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.720 
specialty tank I'd like to have a lot of
substrate<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.780> there<00:05:08.080> but<00:05:08.950> of<00:05:09.160> course<00:05:09.460> the

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
substrate and there but of course the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.880 
substrate and there but of course the
stratum<00:05:10.180> just<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.170> didn't<00:05:11.500> seem<00:05:11.680> like

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
stratum just it and it didn't seem like

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.650 
stratum just it and it didn't seem like
it<00:05:11.920> was<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.370> enough<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.820> begin<00:05:12.970> with<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.510> was

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
it was just enough to begin with I was

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.630 
it was just enough to begin with I was
worried<00:05:13.960> about<00:05:14.080> it<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.590> then<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:14.740> lost<00:05:15.070> most<00:05:15.370> of

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
worried about it and then I lost most of

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.580 
worried about it and then I lost most of
it<00:05:16.260> just<00:05:17.260> because<00:05:17.470> of<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:19.080> all<00:05:20.080> right<00:05:20.350> and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
it just because of that so all right and

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.080 
it just because of that so all right and
that's<00:05:21.010> probably<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.370> biggest<00:05:21.610> thing<00:05:21.880> you'll

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
that's probably the biggest thing you'll

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.760 
that's probably the biggest thing you'll
have<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.390> worry<00:05:22.600> about<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.260> light<00:05:23.440> seems

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
have to worry about and the light seems

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.920 
have to worry about and the light seems
to<00:05:23.860> be<00:05:24.040> effective<00:05:24.520> so<00:05:24.730> far<00:05:25.030> but<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.660> know<00:05:25.690> it's

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
to be effective so far but you know it's

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.000 
to be effective so far but you know it's
only<00:05:26.050> been<00:05:26.200> up<00:05:26.320> for<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.650> week<00:05:26.890> here<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:29.010> that's

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
only been up for a week here so that's

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.180 
only been up for a week here so that's
something<00:05:30.540> I'm<00:05:31.540> gonna<00:05:31.720> constantly<00:05:32.260> watch<00:05:32.710> and

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
something I'm gonna constantly watch and

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.550 
something I'm gonna constantly watch and
I'm<00:05:33.490> thinking<00:05:33.910> about<00:05:34.150> maybe<00:05:34.360> even<00:05:34.560> converting

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
I'm thinking about maybe even converting

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.700 
I'm thinking about maybe even converting
to<00:05:35.980> LEDs<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.910> using<00:05:37.240> LEDs<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:38.080> here<00:05:38.500> all

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
to LEDs and using LEDs and here all

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.070 
to LEDs and using LEDs and here all
right<00:05:39.150> of<00:05:40.150> course<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.630> would<00:05:40.750> be<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.900> little

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
right of course that would be a little

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.240 
right of course that would be a little
expensive<00:05:41.590> but<00:05:42.010> it<00:05:42.100> would<00:05:42.190> also<00:05:42.340> be<00:05:42.610> very<00:05:42.640> nice

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
expensive but it would also be very nice

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
expensive but it would also be very nice
all<00:05:45.250> right<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:45.550> as<00:05:45.640> you<00:05:45.700> can<00:05:45.880> see<00:05:45.940> it's<00:05:46.210> a
