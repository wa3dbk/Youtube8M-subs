travel out into the fluid

travel out into the fluid
the<00:02:23.840> bubbles<00:02:24.200> rapidly<00:02:24.710> coalesce<00:02:25.220> once<00:02:26.000> they

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the bubbles rapidly coalesce once they

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.780 
the bubbles rapidly coalesce once they

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
reach a certain size they seem to eat

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.060 
reach a certain size they seem to eat
other<00:02:29.060> bubbles<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> faster<00:02:30.410> rate<00:02:30.440> thus

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
other bubbles at a faster rate thus

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.550 
other bubbles at a faster rate thus
growing<00:02:31.520> larger<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.050> form<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.470> a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
growing larger and in this form of a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.860 
growing larger and in this form of a
bubble<00:02:33.920> war<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.670> end<00:02:34.850> up<00:02:35.000> with<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.270> bipolar

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
bubble war you end up with a bipolar

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.920 
bubble war you end up with a bipolar
situation<00:02:36.830> with<00:02:37.340> two<00:02:37.550> large<00:02:37.820> bubbles<00:02:38.420> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
situation with two large bubbles that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.100 
situation with two large bubbles that
rapidly<00:02:39.470> eat<00:02:39.680> all<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> other<00:02:40.250> bubbles<00:02:40.520> and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
rapidly eat all the other bubbles and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.410 
rapidly eat all the other bubbles and
eventually<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.560> get<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.830> situation<00:02:43.150> where<00:02:44.150> one

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
eventually you get a situation where one

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.949 
eventually you get a situation where one
bubble<00:02:44.810> dominates<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.739> all<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:47.270> other

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
bubble dominates and all the other

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.800 
bubble dominates and all the other
bubbles<00:02:48.260> are<00:02:48.790> pressed<00:02:49.790> into<00:02:50.060> an<00:02:50.420> annular

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
bubbles are pressed into an annular

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.989 
bubbles are pressed into an annular
space
