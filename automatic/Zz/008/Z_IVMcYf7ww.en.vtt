00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.970
 personal hello okay with you today I 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.340
 I brought you a product that you asked me to 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.470
 much to test is the sudden death of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.140
 moon cosmetics is for those who do not know 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.119
 This brand of moisturizing 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.400
 less what it says here but it only has several 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.869
 active rebuilders I am also 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.520
 using it every week of my 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.259
 interpretations but in my last 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.940
 I also used it alone. 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.920
 discovered that she had as you have seen 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.870
 that on the channel I recorded a video, then 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.480
 hers complete formula is well us 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.250
 a very rich form of components 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.829
 that treat the hair has active 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.140
 active moisturizers that also 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.789
 has several rebuilding assets but it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.469
 it is not that reconstructive mask that 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.780
 leaves hair with a stiff effect as well 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.149
 né is a brand that makes hair more 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.760
 Soft is she makes her hair shiny 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.530
 aligned and super soft but not ours 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 which melts the hair so in the bath is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.920
 good then that kind of brand indicated 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 for more damaged hair for 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.270
 elastic hair also you can 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.040
 have with her wearing it all week and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.560
 in the days of reconstruction only adds 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.750
 Creatine okay hair think hair 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.580
 When you pull it it goes far and back. 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 all the crucible usually hair stays 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.420
 so after chemistry he looks good 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.920
 modified even though it is fragile 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 this type of hair can not use these 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.420
 masses who fainted son always knows 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.430
 use masks that moisturize but also 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 There are those rebuilders and I 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.240
 I have to do more reconstruction. 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.790
 using that china to leave the film 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 harder in jazz and jazz. 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.230
 team even if the hair then 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.390
 brides have to fake the fiber to 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.550
 lose effect I think you can later 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.230
 pass the reconstructions longer as 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.000
 I told you in the last video a 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.610
 pump in this machine well complete agent 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.560
 a very rich form it does not leave the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.180
 Hard hair will wear every week I 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.760
 I've been using it all week of 11 more 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.040
 almost 15 times I 'm never getting 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.930
 a ribbon getting silky we use 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.390
 she is not leaving her hair looking 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.910
 hard I wanted just her but I 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.370
 I came to tell you if I use it. 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.440
 so weekly as the brand indicates it would 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.660
 stick with that stiffer look 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.460
 knows but my son okay then we 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.280
 it can be used every week 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.410
 finally as you prefer to look at one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.670
 A little here for you and that name is 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.710
 very interesting 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.640
 now always the very creative names in the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.320
 masks 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.760
 worth a little expensive for you but 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.830
 super moisturizer 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.350
 it divides for well being and mineral oil 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.020
 our sudden death treatment is like this or 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.540
 you love or you do not know electrons 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.970
 Wireless excusing ending the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.980
 days of dry hair and detonated without 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.320
 pity he is not the most 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.630
 But let's face it, it's full of grace for 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.550
 smoke a whistle and then they are 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.040
 wonderful that you will pray for a 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.810
 Slow death slows me down, your children will go 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.060
 stay and attack homes in a flash 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.780
 sudden death more full of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.030
 pleasure 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.310
 That's why the dead name I found very 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.750
 cool the way we are very long I 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.360
 I'll read you a little bit what you have. 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.160
 here is good what is treatment 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.110
 weekly and very luxurious for hair and 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.180
 inside life is also great for 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.770
 use after the other coloring process 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.440
 what is really after painting 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.630
 the hair is as soft as this morning 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.190
 hit what makes this shape 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.770
 over-active ingredients 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.290
 restores the natural barrier of 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.630
 hair to give softness and strength and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.850
 use as suggested by the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.010
 mega apply once a week after 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.920
 shampoo sudden death or I can do 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.900
 heart or chemical distribute report 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.090
 over the entire length of the wires from 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.860
 pause for ten minutes and rinse and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.390
 finish as usual if you want 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.730
 a more powerful treatment you can 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.670
 use the shampoo line size 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.350
 subtanque an exfoliating shampoo you do 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.090
 a mass application and then you 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.490
 Finishes hair with full repair 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.110
 that also in this line sudden death is 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.180
 then you will have a more 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.070
 powerful rebuilding, it's even good I 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.840
 I'm only using it for 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.330
 while also believing that it has 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.190
 creatine and other active ingredients and 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900
 As I told you, it 's in several ways. 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.430

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.890

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.890
 and resistance while in 1995 that you 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.050

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.540
