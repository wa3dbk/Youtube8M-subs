00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
way that you want it to I mean it it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.690 
way that you want it to I mean it it
takes<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.790> lot<00:02:47.120> more<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:48.770> actually<00:02:49.370> do

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
takes a lot more to actually do

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.820 
takes a lot more to actually do
something<00:02:50.210> positive<00:02:50.540> than<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.350> just<00:02:51.380> go

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
something positive than to just go

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.490 
something positive than to just go
around<00:02:51.980> pooping<00:02:52.610> all<00:02:52.760> over<00:02:52.790> people's<00:02:53.500> comment

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
around pooping all over people's comment

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.170 
around pooping all over people's comment
boards<00:02:54.800> yeah<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.220> think<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.580> reason<00:02:55.730> why<00:02:55.970> they

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
boards yeah I think the reason why they

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.830 
boards yeah I think the reason why they
they<00:02:56.690> find<00:02:57.200> themselves<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:57.740> passionate<00:02:58.580> about

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
they find themselves so passionate about

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.120 
they find themselves so passionate about
people<00:02:59.840> preaching<00:03:00.290> hate<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.860> know<00:03:00.950> like

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
people preaching hate you know like

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.650 
people preaching hate you know like
being<00:03:01.370> gains<00:03:01.610> ordering<00:03:02.030> rider<00:03:02.240> or<00:03:02.330> whatever

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
being gains ordering rider or whatever

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.470 
being gains ordering rider or whatever
is<00:03:02.840> because<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.770> riles<00:03:04.490> something<00:03:04.970> up<00:03:05.120> inside

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
is because it riles something up inside

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.000 
is because it riles something up inside
of<00:03:05.540> them<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.050> they<00:03:06.320> have<00:03:06.410> some<00:03:06.740> hate

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
of them I think they have some hate

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.310 
of them I think they have some hate

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
issues of their own to work on because

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.420 
issues of their own to work on because
when<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.710> see<00:03:09.950> people<00:03:09.980> or<00:03:10.760> arm<00:03:11.890> maybe<00:03:12.890> speaking

we use that energy to make this video
for<00:04:48.080> instance<00:04:48.680> not<00:04:48.979> hatin<00:04:49.340> yeah<00:04:49.939> so<00:04:50.449> I'm<00:04:51.020> not

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
saying like hate is a great tool to use

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.959 
saying like hate is a great tool to use
for<00:04:53.990> creativity<00:04:54.740> like<00:04:54.889> some<00:04:55.129> people<00:04:55.460> do<00:04:55.639> but

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
for creativity like some people do but

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.450 
for creativity like some people do but
you<00:04:56.539> know<00:04:56.659> it<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.080> an<00:04:57.289> energy<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.159> you<00:04:58.310> can

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
you know it is an energy and you can

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.040 
you know it is an energy and you can
transmute<00:04:59.029> it<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.479> do<00:04:59.599> something<00:04:59.629> positive

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
transmute it and do something positive

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.990 
transmute it and do something positive
with<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:00.770> rather<00:05:01.009> than<00:05:01.189> if<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.610> mean<00:05:01.789> if<00:05:01.879> you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
with it rather than if I mean if you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.390 
with it rather than if I mean if you
really<00:05:02.029> don't<00:05:02.930> like<00:05:03.050> hate<00:05:03.439> it<00:05:03.949> doesn't<00:05:04.310> make

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
really don't like hate it doesn't make

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.429 
really don't like hate it doesn't make
sense<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.849> try<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.360> bring<00:05:05.689> more<00:05:05.900> hate<00:05:06.139> in<00:05:06.169> the

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
sense to try to bring more hate in the

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.499 
sense to try to bring more hate in the
world<00:05:06.469> especially<00:05:07.069> you<00:05:07.909> know<00:05:08.029> through<00:05:08.240> people

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
world especially you know through people

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:09.909 
world especially you know through people
like<00:05:08.539> Ryan<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.139> I<00:05:09.199> who<00:05:09.259> aren't<00:05:09.590> really<00:05:09.770> known

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
like Ryan and I who aren't really known

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.980 
like Ryan and I who aren't really known
for<00:05:09.979> our<00:05:10.279> hatred<00:05:11.050> good<00:05:12.050> yeah<00:05:12.819> so<00:05:13.990> that's

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
for our hatred good yeah so that's

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.559 
for our hatred good yeah so that's
pretty<00:05:15.590> much<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.830> yeah<00:05:16.699> so<00:05:16.939> I'm<00:05:17.180> sure<00:05:17.419> we're

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
pretty much it yeah so I'm sure we're

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.320 
pretty much it yeah so I'm sure we're
gonna<00:05:17.659> hear<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.020> down<00:05:18.229> below<00:05:18.909> if<00:05:19.909> you<00:05:19.969> really

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
gonna hear it down below if you really

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.999 
gonna hear it down below if you really
feel<00:05:20.479> like<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:20.870> need<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.139> hate<00:05:21.529> because

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
feel like you need to hate because

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.429 
feel like you need to hate because
someone<00:05:22.400> is<00:05:22.520> hating<00:05:22.909> try<00:05:23.509> to<00:05:23.569> explain<00:05:24.020> that<00:05:24.199> to

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
someone is hating try to explain that to

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.839 
someone is hating try to explain that to
me<00:05:24.560> rationally<00:05:25.159> because<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.639> seems

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
me rationally because it seems

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.939 
me rationally because it seems
absolutely<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.539> hundred<00:05:26.990> percent<00:05:27.110> illogical

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
absolutely a hundred percent illogical

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.769 
absolutely a hundred percent illogical
it's<00:05:28.039> a<00:05:28.099> contradiction<00:05:28.580> since<00:05:29.330> adding

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
it's a contradiction since adding

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.619 
it's a contradiction since adding
rational<00:05:29.960> about<00:05:30.349> hey<00:05:30.589> yeah<00:05:31.300> if<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.509> have

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629

worked on your inner game let us know
down<00:05:35.300> there<00:05:35.599> yeah<00:05:35.960> how<00:05:36.319> basic<00:05:36.830> transmute

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
down there yeah how basic transmute

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.279 
down there yeah how basic transmute
attain<00:05:37.699> something<00:05:38.150> positive<00:05:38.779> I'll<00:05:38.930> do<00:05:39.110> around
