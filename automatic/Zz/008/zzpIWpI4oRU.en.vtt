00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
with the battery um but it adds a lot of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.330 
with the battery um but it adds a lot of
power<00:01:19.400> like<00:01:19.910> lots<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.420> people<00:01:21.070> build<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.190> little

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
power like lots of people build a little

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.000 
power like lots of people build a little
tree<00:01:22.670> below<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.120> she<00:01:23.900> can<00:01:24.110> carry<00:01:24.350> cameras<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
tree below it she can carry cameras and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.180 
tree below it she can carry cameras and
stuff<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.810> know<00:01:26.840> take<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.230> up<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.770> film

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
stuff and you know take it up and film

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.920 
stuff and you know take it up and film
from<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.580> sky<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.120> stuff<00:01:29.360> which<00:01:29.540> is<00:01:29.720> pretty

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
from the sky and stuff which is pretty

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.870 
from the sky and stuff which is pretty
neat<00:01:30.200> idea<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.800> I'll<00:01:31.100> probably<00:01:31.310> do<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:31.730> one

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
neat idea and I'll probably do that one

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.910 
neat idea and I'll probably do that one
time<00:01:32.060> if<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.870> ever<00:01:32.930> do<00:01:33.140> I'll<00:01:33.290> make<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.470> video<00:01:33.860> on

at Romero Mart it's 250 bucks there's
something<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.430> believe<00:02:30.700> with<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> helicopter

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
something I believe with the helicopter

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.420 
something I believe with the helicopter
and<00:02:31.810> remote<00:02:32.080> it's<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.470> really<00:02:32.800> good<00:02:32.980> deal<00:02:33.130> other

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and remote it's a really good deal other

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.960 
and remote it's a really good deal other
than<00:02:33.700> buying<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> remote<00:02:34.300> separately<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
than buying the remote separately and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.729 
than buying the remote separately and
that's<00:02:36.970> why<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.300> got<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.900> then<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.620> know

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
that's why I got it and then you know

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.530 
that's why I got it and then you know
you've<00:02:38.920> got<00:02:39.100> your<00:02:39.250> large<00:02:39.459> LED<00:02:39.940> display<00:02:40.330> at<00:02:40.450> the

you've got your large LED display at the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.850 
you've got your large LED display at the

expensive and it looks really nice
that's<00:02:44.590> definitely<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.010> remote<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.519> want

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
with any walker a helicopter I fly it

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.570 
with any walker a helicopter I fly it
with<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:50.260> CBL<00:02:50.680> inventor<00:02:51.040> didn't<00:02:51.250> everything

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
with my CBL inventor didn't everything

with my CBL inventor didn't everything
which<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.600> still<00:02:52.840> need<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.110> get<00:02:53.170> replacement

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
which I still need to get replacement

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.680 
which I still need to get replacement
parts<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.069> you<00:02:54.430> haven't<00:02:54.640> seen<00:02:54.819> my<00:02:55.330> video<00:02:55.450> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
parts for you haven't seen my video of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.930 
parts for you haven't seen my video of
my<00:02:55.780> hands<00:02:56.140> which<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.799> just<00:02:57.280> about<00:02:57.489> healed<00:02:57.730> up

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
my hands which is just about healed up

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.170 
my hands which is just about healed up
so<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> battery<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.030> comes

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
so this is the battery that it comes

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.780 
so this is the battery that it comes
with<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.989> uh<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.040> said<00:03:03.250> really<00:03:03.459> heavy

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
with it is uh like I said really heavy

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.610 
with it is uh like I said really heavy
but<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.299> gives<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.690> like<00:03:04.870> 11<00:03:05.230> minutes<00:03:05.260> of

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
but it gives you like 11 minutes of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.800 
but it gives you like 11 minutes of
flight<00:03:05.830> time<00:03:06.069> I<00:03:06.340> usually<00:03:07.209> keep<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.630> around

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
flight time I usually keep it around

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.140 
flight time I usually keep it around
five<00:03:08.110> or<00:03:08.140> six<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.739> so<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.700> because<00:03:09.910> I

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
five or six just so that just because I

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.479 
five or six just so that just because I
don't<00:03:10.630> really<00:03:10.750> fly<00:03:11.470> much<00:03:11.739> longer<00:03:12.100> unless<00:03:12.220> it's

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
don't really fly much longer unless it's

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.890 
don't really fly much longer unless it's
outside<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.459> helps<00:03:15.640> last<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.690> life

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
outside but then it helps last the life

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.580 
outside but then it helps last the life
lasts<00:03:17.170> longer<00:03:18.150> here<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.780> connection<00:03:20.560> that

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
lasts longer here is the connection that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.610 
lasts longer here is the connection that
you<00:03:20.739> plug<00:03:21.100> into<00:03:21.340> your<00:03:21.579> charger<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.690> the

connection that you plug into your

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.640 
connection that you plug into your
helicopter<00:03:25.720> itself<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.709> again<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.070> -<00:03:28.650> comes

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650

room<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.220> an<00:03:57.519> indoor<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:57.850> outdoor<00:03:58.359> Holly

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
room it is an indoor and outdoor Holly

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.199 
room it is an indoor and outdoor Holly
so<00:03:58.870> if<00:03:59.440> you're<00:03:59.739> flying<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:00.880> want<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.120> do

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
so if you're flying and you want to do

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.199 
so if you're flying and you want to do
that<00:04:01.390> it's<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.260> fine<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.709> fly<00:04:02.739> indoors<00:04:03.250> only<00:04:04.060> do

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
that it's a fine to fly indoors only do

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.059 
that it's a fine to fly indoors only do
it<00:04:04.329> if<00:04:04.450> you're<00:04:04.600> like

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
it if you're like

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.520 
it if you're like
if<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.849> flew<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.659> Seabee<00:04:06.959> 100<00:04:07.379> and

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
if you flew like the Seabee 100 and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.839 
if you flew like the Seabee 100 and
you're<00:04:07.620> good<00:04:07.769> at<00:04:07.890> that<00:04:08.040> go<00:04:08.340> ahead<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.579> plot

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
you're good at that go ahead and plot

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.300 
you're good at that go ahead and plot
this<00:04:09.000> indoors<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:10.500> not<00:04:10.709> I'd<00:04:10.950> start

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
this indoors but if not I'd start

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.069 
this indoors but if not I'd start
started<00:04:11.879> in<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.120> really<00:04:12.390> big<00:04:12.599> room<00:04:12.840> or

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
started in a really big room or

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.580 
started in a really big room or
something<00:04:13.319> or<00:04:14.060> outside<00:04:15.060> if<00:04:15.329> it's<00:04:15.569> not<00:04:15.870> windy

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
something or outside if it's not windy

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.199 
something or outside if it's not windy
well<00:04:17.519> if<00:04:17.699> it's<00:04:17.850> windy

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
well if it's windy

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.240 
well if it's windy
just<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.750> careful<00:04:20.030> but<00:04:21.530> like<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.560> say<00:04:22.949> that's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
just be careful but like I say that's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.610 
just be careful but like I say that's
fine<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.639> my<00:04:23.789> kitchen<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.810> I'll<00:04:25.050> end<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.350> on<00:04:25.470> my

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
fine in my kitchen and I'll end it on my

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.150 
fine in my kitchen and I'll end it on my
table<00:04:25.830> but<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:27.050> messed<00:04:28.050> up<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.979> went

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
table but I messed up and it went

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.400 
table but I messed up and it went
backwards<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.820> landed<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.270> its<00:04:30.479> blade<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.080> it

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
backwards and landed on its blade so it

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.469 
backwards and landed on its blade so it
cracked<00:04:31.770> those<00:04:31.979> but<00:04:32.400> other<00:04:32.970> than<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.240> there

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
cracked those but other than that there

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.740 
cracked those but other than that there
wasn't<00:04:33.630> any<00:04:33.840> other<00:04:34.110> damage<00:04:34.380> which<00:04:34.889> was<00:04:35.039> nice

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
wasn't any other damage which was nice

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.710 
wasn't any other damage which was nice
all<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:36.990> see<00:04:37.289> with<00:04:37.470> those<00:04:37.620> blades<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.720> I've

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
all I can see with those blades and I've

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.060 
all I can see with those blades and I've
yet<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.080> fly<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.470> from<00:04:40.650> there

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
yet to fly it from there

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.159 
yet to fly it from there
but<00:04:41.460> everything<00:04:42.000> else<00:04:42.090> seems<00:04:42.419> good<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:42.960> far

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
but everything else seems good so far

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.589 
but everything else seems good so far
and<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:44.580> remote<00:04:44.880> actually<00:04:45.330> works<00:04:45.479> really

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
and the remote actually works really

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.960 
and the remote actually works really
well<00:04:45.990> at<00:04:46.740> first<00:04:47.099> you<00:04:47.340> may<00:04:47.460> need<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.729> play<00:04:47.849> with

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
well at first you may need to play with

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.370 
well at first you may need to play with
some<00:04:48.150> switches<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.900> make<00:04:49.050> sure<00:04:49.229> it's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
some switches just to make sure it's

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.350 
some switches just to make sure it's
right<00:04:49.590> before<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.009> take<00:04:50.039> off<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.880> do<00:04:51.180> not

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
right before you take off and do not

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.270 
right before you take off and do not
touch<00:04:51.630> any<00:04:51.840> switches<00:04:52.169> while<00:04:52.500> flying<00:04:52.740> because

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
touch any switches while flying because

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.270 
touch any switches while flying because
I<00:04:53.389> like<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.539> throw<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.840> modes<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.289> stuff<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
I like to throw the modes and stuff it

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.689 
I like to throw the modes and stuff it
will<00:04:56.460> completely<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.509> will<00:04:57.979> it's<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.580> will

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
will completely it will it's it will

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.310 
will completely it will it's it will
just<00:04:59.880> mess<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.270> up<00:05:00.300> in<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.720> throttles<00:05:01.139> will

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
just mess you up in the throttles will

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.080 
just mess you up in the throttles will
go<00:05:01.500> all<00:05:01.680> crazy<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.280> probably<00:05:02.849> crash

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
go all crazy and probably crash

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.029 
go all crazy and probably crash
something<00:05:03.419> so<00:05:03.780> make<00:05:04.410> sure<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.650> leave<00:05:04.800> the

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
something so make sure you leave the

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.560 
something so make sure you leave the
remote<00:05:05.460> alone<00:05:05.759> except<00:05:06.060> for<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.270> movie<00:05:06.539> and

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
remote alone except for the movie and

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.460 
remote alone except for the movie and
once<00:05:06.780> while<00:05:06.990> you're<00:05:07.110> flying

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
once while you're flying

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.649 
once while you're flying
once<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.370> go<00:05:08.490> 3d<00:05:08.910> you'll<00:05:09.090> be<00:05:09.240> able<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.479> learn

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
once you go 3d you'll be able to learn

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.689 
once you go 3d you'll be able to learn
about<00:05:09.960> all<00:05:10.139> those<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.590> really<00:05:11.010> haven't<00:05:11.190> yet<00:05:11.520> but

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
about all those I really haven't yet but

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.860 
about all those I really haven't yet but
I<00:05:11.940> probably<00:05:12.690> will<00:05:12.990> soon<00:05:14.090> but<00:05:15.090> that's<00:05:15.720> the

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
I probably will soon but that's the

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.719 
I probably will soon but that's the
helicopter<00:05:16.020> for<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.710> everything's<00:05:17.520> really

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
helicopter for you everything's really

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.820 
helicopter for you everything's really
durable<00:05:18.240> like<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:18.960> heads<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.380> stuff<00:05:19.620> of

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
durable like the heads and stuff of

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.770 
durable like the heads and stuff of
course<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.190> blades<00:05:20.400> break<00:05:20.760> probably<00:05:21.510> because

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
course the blades break probably because

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.930 
course the blades break probably because
the<00:05:21.900> full<00:05:22.110> force<00:05:22.380> landed<00:05:22.800> on<00:05:22.919> them<00:05:23.099> but<00:05:23.310> as

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
the full force landed on them but as

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.000 
the full force landed on them but as
many<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:25.020> may<00:05:25.199> know<00:05:25.380> if<00:05:25.530> you<00:05:25.710> flew<00:05:25.979> a

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
many of you may know if you flew a

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.040 
many of you may know if you flew a
helicopter<00:05:26.580> before

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
helicopter before

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.680 
helicopter before
blades<00:05:28.050> break<00:05:28.349> very<00:05:28.680> very<00:05:29.130> easy<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.849> broke<00:05:30.570> a

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
blades break very very easy I broke a

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.279 
blades break very very easy I broke a
few<00:05:30.720> of<00:05:31.050> my<00:05:31.080> own<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:33.090> everything<00:05:33.990> else<00:05:34.139> is

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
few of my own but everything else is

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.029 
few of my own but everything else is
good<00:05:34.349> the<00:05:34.590> parts<00:05:34.800> are<00:05:34.949> good<00:05:36.229> it's<00:05:37.229> it's<00:05:37.800> got

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
good the parts are good it's it's got

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.770 
good the parts are good it's it's got
actually<00:05:38.490> an<00:05:38.669> electric<00:05:39.150> motor<00:05:39.389> on<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.659> back

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
actually an electric motor on the back

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.379 
actually an electric motor on the back
it's<00:05:40.500> not<00:05:40.740> for<00:05:41.039> actually<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.880> help<00:05:42.090> them<00:05:42.240> move

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
it's not for actually to help them move

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.550 
it's not for actually to help them move
but<00:05:42.690> it's<00:05:42.840> just<00:05:42.930> for<00:05:43.199> looks

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560
