00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.380
 and well hello to everyone and john 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.569
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.010
 little recap video a little ago 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.110
 over a year I changed my dough 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.130
 thermal and it was to make the point 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 said to do with you because I have 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:25.470
 a lot of questions regarding his a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 year after the noise that she made there 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590
 we are on the plan of versus zombies on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 still hears the fan not bad by 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 report to the center of the game so I think 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.370
 that it is necessary to spare and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.620
 the thermal paste remains soon 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 what am I going to do that then I 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.559
 would put after the change dough 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.020
 thermal on the same game a little what 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.550
 it almost gives go on the game like 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 plants versus zombies I have the fan 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 not that starts even when we hurt 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.170
 far from being thoroughly but it's when 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.430
 even quite noisy so we'll see I 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.989
 will change thermal paste and then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.000
 we'll see that I'll see to put there 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.820
 where the arctic silver or a cache 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.190
 a guardian here is me I tell you more 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.770
 late at the end of the video 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.969
 so here after disassembly we surrender 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.869
 account that the thermal plate is 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.049
 relatively dry on the whole 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.970
 outer 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.260
 she is really quite dry there is that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 the part there that stay pretty much in 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.400
 good condition we are sorry this is the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.549
 mackerel is not very very good 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 So here is change no karmic 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.430
 Well, we can conclude that after one 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.840
 year to thermal paste she is good at 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.610
 to be changed is still 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 processors that ask not far from 70 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 at 80 degrees I think so suddenly that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.460
 it does not hurt to be changed 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.979
 every year here's a go I'll be 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.659
 little saw a little dot on one time 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.479
 their editing makes see to see if she 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 makes noise by the tailors and well 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.189
 off and friends we will turn on the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.079
 light 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.210
 it will be better after the change 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.140
 of thermal paste it's been an hour since 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.140
 the ps4 turn 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:02:00.000
 I do not know if you perceive because 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:01.800
 that it is relatively silent to the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.190
 always on the same game like this one 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.780
 share on on a transparency by 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.980
 relationship to the type of game a step we say 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.090
 that I put a game less greedy thing 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.680
 like that is by something that is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.990
 very greedy but she is already well 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.890
 less brilliant than stone before 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.990
 thermal paste change 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.320
 so here's for info I put the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.930
 mx 4 from arctic very very good 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.640
 not applying this an amenity it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.820
 maybe even a little less because 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.500
 that good the processor is small and that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.970
 rolled corner I did not do any applications 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.260
 games but the grain of rice I put the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.940
 ventirad make the motherboard on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.510
 ventirad because on the ps4 it's 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 like that I serve correctly every 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.450
 side a little bit on each side 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.700
 to spread the dough well 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.890
 correctly a step no greenhouse and to 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.090
 background a dvi what the dough crushes 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.800
 more than next to each other 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.930
 and then after that it's not uniform 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.690
 do it a quarter of a quarter turn 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.940
 or a half turn by tardis quickly done and 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.800
 it rolls here so do not hesitate to 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.570
 post comments to tell me if if 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.830
 you too have already changed the dough 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.160
 thermal and if you think there is 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.350
 need 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.209
 in any case I think that once per 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.590
 year it does not hurt him 3 is sure 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.470
 about the point you saw there are 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.020
 few seconds that the thermal paste 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.970
 had dry on the edges 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.750
 good bah listen I 'll see you soon at 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.140
 the next video 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.140
 Hi
