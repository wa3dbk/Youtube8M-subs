00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.200 
here we go we've knocked it down from
four<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:06.710> one<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.370> think<00:02:07.610> about<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.790> if<00:02:08.030> you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
four to one so think about that if you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.510 
four to one so think about that if you
had<00:02:08.330> three<00:02:08.810> bars<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.470> even<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.100> paid<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
had three bars and even if you paid the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.200 
had three bars and even if you paid the
extra<00:02:10.640> money<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.270> have<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.990> silicone<00:02:12.590> case

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
extra money to have this silicone case

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.580 
extra money to have this silicone case
you<00:02:14.210> know<00:02:14.300> what<00:02:14.510> would<00:02:14.660> end<00:02:14.810> up<00:02:14.930> happening<00:02:14.990> is

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
you know what would end up happening is

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.320 
you know what would end up happening is
your<00:02:16.160> phone<00:02:16.400> your<00:02:16.790> phone<00:02:16.820> call<00:02:17.180> would<00:02:17.300> have

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
your phone your phone call would have

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.770 
your phone your phone call would have
been<00:02:17.420> dropped<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:18.020> mean<00:02:18.739> again<00:02:19.370> not<00:02:20.239> holding<00:02:20.660> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
been dropped I mean again not holding it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.080 
been dropped I mean again not holding it
in<00:02:20.870> any<00:02:21.080> different<00:02:21.739> way<00:02:21.920> than<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.700> would<00:02:22.850> hold

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
in any different way than you would hold

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.790 
in any different way than you would hold
any<00:02:23.300> other<00:02:23.510> phone<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.870> know<00:02:23.930> apples<00:02:24.410> really<00:02:24.680> an

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
any other phone I know apples really an

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.340 
any other phone I know apples really an
innovation<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.730> think<00:02:26.390> right<00:02:26.900> now<00:02:27.110> what

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
innovation I think right now what

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.540 
innovation I think right now what
they're<00:02:27.440> trying<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.190> they're<00:02:28.310> trying

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
they're trying to do is they're trying

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.390 
they're trying to do is they're trying
to<00:02:28.580> innovate<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.239> way<00:02:29.330> people<00:02:29.540> hold<00:02:30.400> foley's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
to innovate the way people hold foley's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400 
to innovate the way people hold foley's
so<00:02:32.120> uh<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.600> know<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.720> think<00:02:32.810> they<00:02:33.020> should<00:02:33.170> stick

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
so uh you know I think they should stick

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.380 
so uh you know I think they should stick
more<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.709> making<00:02:34.310> sure<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.730> technology<00:02:34.910> they

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
more to making sure the technology they

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.870 
more to making sure the technology they
develop<00:02:36.100> there's<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.130> little<00:02:37.280> bit<00:02:37.430> more<00:02:37.580> sound

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
develop there's a little bit more sound

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.010 
develop there's a little bit more sound
before<00:02:38.090> they<00:02:38.330> release<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.840> public

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
before they release to the public

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.600 
before they release to the public
because<00:02:39.260> right<00:02:39.530> now<00:02:39.560> all<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.220> early

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
because right now all of the early

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.090 
because right now all of the early
adopters<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.270> this<00:02:41.540> technology<00:02:41.900> are<00:02:42.500> pretty

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
adopters of this technology are pretty

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.020 
adopters of this technology are pretty
much<00:02:43.340> screwed<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:44.630> see<00:02:44.810> right<00:02:44.840> here

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
much screwed so you can see right here

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.210 
much screwed so you can see right here
you<00:02:47.030> know<00:02:47.180> what's<00:02:47.870> happened<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.860> went<00:02:49.040> from

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
you know what's happened is we went from

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.070 
you know what's happened is we went from
four<00:02:49.580> bars<00:02:49.880> you're<00:02:50.300> pretty<00:02:50.510> much<00:02:50.570> able<00:02:50.989> to

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
four bars you're pretty much able to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.170 
four bars you're pretty much able to
knock<00:02:51.290> about<00:02:51.620> three<00:02:52.010> bars<00:02:52.280> off<00:02:52.550> whatever<00:02:52.790> your

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
knock about three bars off whatever your

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.810 
knock about three bars off whatever your
current<00:02:53.540> reception<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:55.040> by<00:02:55.220> holding<00:02:55.489> it

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
current reception is just by holding it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.860 
current reception is just by holding it
so<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:57.260> right<00:02:57.680> there<00:02:57.739> is<00:02:58.340> proof<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.180> even

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
so that right there is proof that even

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.350 
so that right there is proof that even
getting<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:00.790> surrounding<00:03:01.790> bumper

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
getting the little surrounding bumper

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.310 
getting the little surrounding bumper
does<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.170> really<00:03:03.560> help<00:03:03.800> all<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.100> much
