00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.519
 Hello, what are we going to do? 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.170
 Now it 's a cube for halloween like 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.170
 if it was a little mummy 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.240
 I'm going to take the bottle and to be able 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.240
 fix the band 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.090
 we do not work 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.090
 and from the base 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 before 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.600
 we take the bandage 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.220
 and we started to paste 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.840
 let's go around the bottle 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.180
 do not excel a little bit of what is the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.769
 outline and then we will stick it a bit 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.769
 so that it does not hurt us 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.679
 Y 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679
 i 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.860
 what I'm going to do is join this 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.270
 here 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.270
 with the next sale 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.130
 and with this what we will do is go around 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.020
 and from time to time do it if a little 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.700
 twisted 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.700
 so that it gives a more 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.390
 of a mummy 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.340
 if we miss a bit, nothing happens 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.490
 because we can fix it with the same 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.490
 zeal 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.930
 we will continue joining the inside part 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.330
 so that we do not escape 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
 ah 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.440
 I will explain to you from a point the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.960
 If you find it more comfortable to put it on 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.940
 beginning 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.270
 you put it around what is the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.790
 bottle but inside to pick up 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.360
 all this little bandage that we have left 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.440
 I'm doing it right now 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.240
 but from the beginning also what 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 you can place a value and so on 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.760
 it's just digging what is the edge 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.650
 so that you do not get those little bits of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.680
 come and stay a little longer 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.560
 plus 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.270
 finer is not so blunt 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.960
 and now we want to put your eyes to 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.960
 to mom 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.540
 now we take a little bit of zeal 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.540
 for each eye 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.579
 it turns red 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.290
 As you can see we will take advantage of this here 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.620
 we put it there 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.150
 we put this 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.049
 we will place electronic 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.720
 two 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.770
 we will take the wires 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.000
 I'm doing 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.580
 is the handle with a little bit of decoration 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080
 They are pieces of black straw and a 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.110
 little bit of wire to make the handle of the 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.449
 cube once finished 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:36.009
 of placing all the pieces what 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.009
 we're going to do is tighten it a little bit 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.970
 because how are we going to put it in 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.150
 football at least so you have a 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.960
 finer step costs us so much later 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.960
 pass it through the hole 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.270
 this will be the ax 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.720
 the comedian 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.720
 we will place it here we can do it 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.710
 with a needle 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:17.839
 it is not easy after easy it leaves me 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.839
 pretty pretty thick 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.540
 we will not charge to put it for the same 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.020
 Needle hole can be a bit 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.020
 hard 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.280
 and at the same time 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.479
 we give with the pliers also 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.570
 we treat each other a little 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.380
 again 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.280
 and now we do it when the other 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.280
 as well 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.250
 and we finished lhasa 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.430
 Y 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.430
 in world play 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.880
 and so finally filling in the cube 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:24.850
 sweets 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.850
 we will have our mummy purpose
