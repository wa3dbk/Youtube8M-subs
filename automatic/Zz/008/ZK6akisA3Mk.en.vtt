it in yet as I just want to show you
guys<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.210> bait<00:02:06.450> well<00:02:06.750> I'll<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.560> ahead<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
guys the bait well I'll go ahead and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.719 
guys the bait well I'll go ahead and
lock<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
lock it in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.850 
lock it in
fact<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.930> think<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.560> it's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
fact so I think that's it I think it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550 
fact so I think that's it I think it's
on<00:02:14.280> pretty<00:02:14.790> tight<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.269> pretty<00:02:15.420> firm<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.470> as

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
on pretty tight and pretty firm so as

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.199 
on pretty tight and pretty firm so as
you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.159> can<00:02:17.190> still<00:02:17.549> see<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.849> little

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
you can see you can still see a little

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.350 
you can see you can still see a little
bit<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.510> Pikachu<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:19.730> well<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.120> still

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
bit of Pikachu there well you can still

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.199 
bit of Pikachu there well you can still
see<00:02:21.680> like<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.280> know<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
see like you know a little bit of the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.509 
see like you know a little bit of the
color<00:02:24.590> around<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> cameras<00:02:26.099> but<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.430> know

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
color around the cameras but you know

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.259 
color around the cameras but you know
it's<00:02:26.670> expected<00:02:27.390> nothing<00:02:27.599> too<00:02:27.989> bad<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> that's

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
it's expected nothing too bad so that's

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.339 
it's expected nothing too bad so that's
pretty<00:02:30.480> cool<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:30.989> thing<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.319> about

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
pretty cool but one thing I like about

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.470 
pretty cool but one thing I like about
this<00:02:31.560> case<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.549> take<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.090> bottom

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
this case is you can take the bottom

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.140 
this case is you can take the bottom
piece<00:02:33.720> off<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:35.690> throw<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.720> directly<00:02:40.549> on<00:02:41.549> if

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
piece off and throw it directly on if

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.080 
piece off and throw it directly on if
you<00:02:42.299> have<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> 3dsxl<00:02:43.110> which<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.489> something<00:02:44.879> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you have the 3dsxl which is something I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.809 
you have the 3dsxl which is something I
do<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.900> something<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.440> use<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:47.010> lot

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
do have and something that I use a lot

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.270 
do have and something that I use a lot
so<00:02:49.069> that<00:02:50.069> was<00:02:50.220> probably<00:02:50.400> my<00:02:50.819> big<00:02:52.250> reason<00:02:53.250> for

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so that was probably my big reason for

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.009 
so that was probably my big reason for
getting<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> fact

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
getting this one because of the fact

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.839 
getting this one because of the fact
that<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.829> was<00:02:56.010> separate<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.549> lot<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
that it it was separate a lot of the

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.199 
that it it was separate a lot of the
cases<00:02:57.030> had<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.810> snap-on<00:02:58.349> pieces<00:02:59.180> kind<00:03:00.180> of

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
cases had like snap-on pieces kind of

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.520 
cases had like snap-on pieces kind of
like<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.599> gamestop<00:03:01.200> 3ds<00:03:01.799> X<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:03.079> gamestop<00:03:04.079> 3ds

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
like the gamestop 3ds X of gamestop 3ds

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.670 
like the gamestop 3ds X of gamestop 3ds
regular<00:03:05.190> cases<00:03:05.609> but<00:03:06.359> this<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.049> didn't<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
regular cases but this one didn't and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.530 
regular cases but this one didn't and
I'd<00:03:07.769> be<00:03:07.890> able<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.129> use<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.459> with<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.090> circle

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
I'd be able to use it with the circle

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.680 
I'd be able to use it with the circle
pad<00:03:09.569> pro<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.579> that<00:03:11.579> is<00:03:11.819> awesome<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.269> my<00:03:12.299> opinion

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
pad pro so that is awesome in my opinion

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.640 
pad pro so that is awesome in my opinion
but<00:03:13.280> outside<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.400> yeah<00:03:15.389> if<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.410> wanted

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
but outside of that yeah if you wanted

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
but outside of that yeah if you wanted
to<00:03:16.739> get<00:03:16.859> this<00:03:17.010> case<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.730> believe<00:03:18.329> at<00:03:18.780> first<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to get this case I believe at first it

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.789 
to get this case I believe at first it
was<00:03:19.319> like<00:03:19.410> 1999<00:03:20.299> but<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.780> particular<00:03:22.109> color

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
was like 1999 but this particular color

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.539 
was like 1999 but this particular color
