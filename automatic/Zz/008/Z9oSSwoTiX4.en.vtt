venema<00:03:02.350> thinks<00:03:02.680> most<00:03:02.860> people<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.459> don't

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
venema thinks most people just don't

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.340 
venema thinks most people just don't
know<00:03:03.970> what<00:03:04.239> New<00:03:04.360> Mexico<00:03:04.810> has<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.050> offer

compared<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.130> neighboring<00:03:06.519> states<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:07.120> think

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
compared to neighboring states I think

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.180 
compared to neighboring states I think
so<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.780> think<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.230> other<00:03:08.260> place<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:08.950> course

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
so I think the other place is of course

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.039 
so I think the other place is of course
