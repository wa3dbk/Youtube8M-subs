here's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> simpler<00:00:30.000> explanation<00:00:30.810> imagine

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
here's a simpler explanation imagine

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
here's a simpler explanation imagine
your<00:00:31.500> eye<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.130> lens<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.059> pupil<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
your eye is the lens and the pupil is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
your eye is the lens and the pupil is
the<00:00:34.200> aperture<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:35.130> size<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> opening

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the aperture or size of the opening

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
the aperture or size of the opening
letting<00:00:36.510> light<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:37.110> your<00:00:37.140> eye<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.129> iris

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
letting light into your eye the iris

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
letting light into your eye the iris
changes<00:00:39.059> size<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.570> different<00:00:40.020> situations<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
changes size in different situations to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
changes size in different situations to
make<00:00:40.710> sure<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.100> retinas<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.180> no<00:00:42.510> idea

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
make sure your retinas have no idea

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.150 
make sure your retinas have no idea
where<00:00:42.930> those<00:00:43.050> are<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> can't<00:00:43.739> point<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.010> them

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
where those are so I can't point to them

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
where those are so I can't point to them
don't<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.820> fried<00:00:45.090> from<00:00:45.329> too<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:45.629> sunlight

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
don't get fried from too much sunlight

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.529 
don't get fried from too much sunlight
on<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.770> eye<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> iris<00:00:47.399> controls<00:00:48.239> itself

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
on your eye the iris controls itself

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
on your eye the iris controls itself
automatically<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.950> camera<00:00:50.460> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
automatically put on a camera it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
automatically put on a camera it's
controlled<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> scale<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.840> numbers<00:00:52.410> called

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
controlled on a scale of numbers called

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
controlled on a scale of numbers called
the<00:00:52.890> f-stop<00:00:53.760> scale<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.530> important

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the f-stop scale and it's very important

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
the f-stop scale and it's very important
to<00:00:56.100> understand<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> scale<00:00:57.270> works<00:00:57.570> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to understand how the scale works in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
to understand how the scale works in
order<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.170> keep<00:00:58.469> control<00:00:58.770> over<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.520> image<00:00:59.699> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
order to keep control over your image so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
order to keep control over your image so
let's<00:01:00.329> take<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> look<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> shall<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
let's take a look at it shall we

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.060 
let's take a look at it shall we
these<00:01:02.520> scale<00:01:03.000> starts<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:04.350> 1<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.949> can

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
these scale starts down here at 1 it can

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
these scale starts down here at 1 it can
go<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.060> 32<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.810> normal

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
go all the way up to 32 on a normal

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.200 
go all the way up to 32 on a normal
scale<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> amount<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> light

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
scale with the amount of light

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
scale with the amount of light
decreasing<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> number<00:01:10.740> rises<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.700> an<00:01:11.970> F

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
decreasing as the number rises so an F

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.380 
decreasing as the number rises so an F
2.0<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.590> let<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.920> more<00:01:14.070> light<00:01:14.130> than<00:01:14.490> an<00:01:14.640> F<00:01:14.850> 11

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
2.0 will let in more light than an F 11

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.260 
2.0 will let in more light than an F 11
that<00:01:16.020> part<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> pretty<00:01:16.560> straightforward

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
that part is pretty straightforward

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
that part is pretty straightforward
smaller<00:01:18.270> numbers<00:01:18.689> equals<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.470> light<00:01:19.830> which

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
smaller numbers equals more light which

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.710 
smaller numbers equals more light which
you<00:01:20.400> know<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.700> our<00:01:20.790> last<00:01:20.850> step<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> field

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you know from our last step the field

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
you know from our last step the field
video<00:01:21.990> equals<00:01:22.680> shallower<00:01:23.100> depth<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.580> field

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
video equals shallower depth of field

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
video equals shallower depth of field
you<00:01:24.119> may<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> numbers<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> scale

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you may think the numbers on this scale

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
you may think the numbers on this scale
are<00:01:26.100> arbitrary<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.600> actually

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
are arbitrary but they actually

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
are arbitrary but they actually
represent<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> ratio<00:01:28.560> between<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> size<00:01:29.880> of
