see the blue stars I don't know if I was

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.449 
see the blue stars I don't know if I was
able<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.950> see<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.520> crackling<00:01:23.000> though<00:01:23.179> so<00:01:24.459> this

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
able to see the crackling though so this

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.520 
able to see the crackling though so this
was<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.849> closest<00:01:26.330> one<00:01:26.509> in<00:01:26.660> terms<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:27.080> what<00:01:27.380> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
was the closest one in terms of what the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
was the closest one in terms of what the
effect<00:01:27.830> was<00:01:28.069> so<00:01:28.869> yeah<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:31.039> shells<00:01:31.310> are

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
effect was so yeah the shells are

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.240 
effect was so yeah the shells are
mislabeled<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.479> believe<00:01:32.899> for<00:01:33.220> 2014<00:01:34.220> as<00:01:34.369> well

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
mislabeled I believe for 2014 as well

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.770 
mislabeled I believe for 2014 as well
but<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.340> thought<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.759> effect<00:01:38.119> was<00:01:38.270> overall

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
but I thought the effect was overall

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.249 
but I thought the effect was overall
nice<00:01:40.539> considering<00:01:41.539> this<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.929> first<00:01:42.110> time

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
nice considering this is the first time

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.479 
nice considering this is the first time
I<00:01:42.319> shot<00:01:42.590> them<00:01:42.770> off<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.069> thought<00:01:43.280> they<00:01:43.429> were

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:43.489 
I shot them off I thought they were

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:47.109 
I shot them off I thought they were
pretty<00:01:43.700> good<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:45.380> Sam<00:01:45.679> was<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> lot<00:01:46.220> louder

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
pretty good the Sam was a lot louder

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.880 
pretty good the Sam was a lot louder
especially<00:01:47.989> out<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.170> when<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.530> came<00:01:48.679> out<00:01:48.709> of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
especially out of when it came out of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.960 
especially out of when it came out of
the<00:01:48.979> tube<00:01:49.190> in<00:01:49.489> person<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.399> explosion<00:01:52.849> was

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
the tube in person and the explosion was

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.059 
the tube in person and the explosion was
also<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.330> little<00:01:53.599> bit<00:01:53.690> louder<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.229> judge<00:01:54.860> for

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
also a little bit louder but judge for

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.749 
also a little bit louder but judge for
yourselves<00:01:55.399> um<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.780> here's<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.590> demo<00:01:58.099> of<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
yourselves um so here's the demo of the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.719 
yourselves um so here's the demo of the
show

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:27.010 

yeah<00:02:04.729> eventually<00:02:05.479> anything<00:02:06.229> was<00:02:06.469> loud<00:02:06.799> man
