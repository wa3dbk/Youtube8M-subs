00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
that and this may not seem like very

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.780 
that and this may not seem like very
much<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.739> Giotto<00:03:14.069> kind<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.489> started

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
much but Giotto kind of started

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.250 
much but Giotto kind of started

here's<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.920> story<00:03:47.190> about<00:03:47.310> Giotto<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:47.970> think

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
here's a story about Giotto that I think

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.259

is<00:03:48.450> both<00:03:48.599> pretty<00:03:49.260> damn<00:03:49.470> funny<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.190> shows<00:03:51.090> his

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
is both pretty damn funny and shows his

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.880 
is both pretty damn funny and shows his
personality<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.019> rather<00:03:52.200> interesting

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
personality and a rather interesting

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.619 
personality and a rather interesting
light<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:53.700> remember<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.000> painting<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.420> showed
