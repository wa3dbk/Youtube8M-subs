00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.549
 the fabia has been hot for years 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.380
 Skoda sandwich that means on the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.060
 shoulders of this new third 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.529
 generation a big responsibility 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.790
 peace 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.560
 if you look closely you recognize all sorts 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.570
 style elements of concept cars that the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.529
 exhibition days have already been posted in recent years 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.779
 it is a whole lot again a whole lot 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.670
 become typical skoda that means that 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.269
 he is up-to-date but not 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.430
 more than that 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.860
 it has been carefully designed 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.600
 vesicles actually men in between is this one 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.100
 also a lot thicker than the last 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.320
 generation then my name comes because he 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.400
 three centimeters lower and no less than 9 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.400
 centimeters wider 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.820
 but have a good look a few weeks 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.440
 been able to do so extensively on the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.390
 paris floor today it is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.870
 time to start driving the new one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.870
 fabia 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 so a car that won't surprise that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.580
 is made up of the known building blocks 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.930
 of volkswagen the mqb platform 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.159
 parts thereof and that makes this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.320
 car 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.630
 very neat 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 predictable somewhat boring but in every 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.710
 case a decent car it is a car 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.470
 never really very surprised to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.210
 he is not comfortable 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.290
 like a c could be he is real 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.970
 what about the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.470
 on the softer side and that makes 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.160
 him everyone's friend and exactly that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.710
 is what a skoda should be like you 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.210
 control feels he is very nice possession 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.200
 does exactly what i want he is beautiful 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.880
 neutral 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 but this mind what little feedback 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.410
 just like the appearance it is too 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.420
 interior of this car is with whole 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.520
 also score the means again 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.140
 tidy solid materials 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.090
 clearly just a step less than the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.790
 volkswagen and audi but rarely 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.160
 finish and those nice clean lines 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.220
 so very overview on very ergonomic 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.750
 designed all beautiful piano lacquer here 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.180
 What code is often doing is one 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.270
 combination of beige with black around that 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.220
 break through dullness and here a nice one 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.390
 multimedia screen on the dashboard 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.400
 built-in 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.380
 only there is something to it because you already think 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.239
 everything is on and on, but this is not the case 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.310
 this is what they call 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.720
 hear no I do not get it in my latch 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.459
 head the word and he is also a good one 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.290
 reason for what it is and 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.150
 Unworkable system is becoming more common 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.230
 became cheaper cars that they screen so 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.280
 and there's nothing there 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.290
 below then you must tell him that you 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.370
 We pick up the telephone they want 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.870
 costs 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.550
 you will do it yourself but you have to 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.270
 own smartphone that you need much 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.470
 with your car 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.700
 if it is two things in the world that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.130
 not mats are one with each other 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.590
 smartphone are cars it never goes 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.040
 good or still with opel or with pep 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.049
 with citroÃ«n and or here in this skoda 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.670
 navigating is a drama it 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.019
 communicate with each other and if they score 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.459
 we say yes you were nonsense 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.739
 are biased away this morning this 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.810
 picked up the car when she picked up that mine 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.820
 gave key when navigation yes if it 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.709
 then is not bad then you just have to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.150
 unplug usb plug and in and then 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.160
 he will have started again 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.720
 but well i always say a phone is on 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.459
 to call 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.540
 I mean I'm not going to mow the grass with 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.540
 my senseo device or 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.030
 as for the engines, there is a wide choice 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.500
 but also little new under the sun there 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.270
 his famous engines are 4 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.760
 gasoline engines 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.430
 twice and three-cylinder atmosphere 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650
 who is with 60 and 75 years then you have the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.600
 a point two fire will see that thea 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.330
 you have that with 90 hp that's this us 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.710
 frame and and 110 hp version and then 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.420
 of course also diesels around 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.520
 to be exact two you always have one 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.210
 straws a thing 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.800
 the of 105 hp the new miscellaneous comes to an end 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.310
 from this year to our country 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.660
 combi follows open and it will come in February 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.030
 oh i would almost forget but whole 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.860
 important of course the space because that 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.470
 is something that schools are always strong for 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:35.640
 and believe me that is not with this fabia 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:38.490
 otherwise I really have behind myself 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.830
 quite a lot of room for b-segmenter 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.050
 knees ok and very good headroom 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.700
 in the back you have 310 liters of luggage space 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.700
 or the largest class
