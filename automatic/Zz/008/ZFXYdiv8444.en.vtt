of<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.660> debate<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> fact<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.280> that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
of this debate but the fact is that

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.610 
of this debate but the fact is that
Formula<00:02:39.060> One<00:02:39.209> as<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> whole<00:02:39.629> was<00:02:40.080> set<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> lose

Formula One as a whole was set to lose
hugely<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.400> fact<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:41.790> losing<00:02:42.300> hugely<00:02:42.659> as

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
hugely and in fact was losing hugely as

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.290 
hugely and in fact was losing hugely as
a<00:02:42.959> result<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.310> conjecture<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.150> on
