MPC<00:00:54.130> that's<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:54.850> kind<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.090> thing<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:55.300> I<00:00:55.450> was

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
MPC that's the kind of thing that I was

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.820 
MPC that's the kind of thing that I was
finding<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:55.960> was<00:00:56.050> doing<00:00:56.230> more<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.440> more<00:00:56.650> off

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
finding I was doing more and more off

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.040 
finding I was doing more and more off
working<00:00:57.310> with<00:00:57.460> Genesis<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.810> Panavision

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
working with Genesis the Panavision

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.250 
working with Genesis the Panavision
camera<00:00:59.260> talking<00:01:00.160> about<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.460> t20<00:01:01.150> and<00:01:02.020> also

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
camera talking about the t20 and also

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.920 
camera talking about the t20 and also
the<00:01:02.350> 909<00:01:03.220> 50s<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.180> everything<00:01:04.600> else<00:01:04.720> at<00:01:04.809> that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
the 909 50s and everything else at that

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
the 909 50s and everything else at that
time<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.549> idea<00:01:06.579> of<00:01:06.969> the<00:01:07.000> event<00:01:07.329> is<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.710> get

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
time so the idea of the event is to get

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.859 
time so the idea of the event is to get
people<00:01:08.979> from<00:01:09.670> production<00:01:09.939> specifically<00:01:10.689> do

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
people from production specifically do

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.230 
people from production specifically do
PS<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.320> come<00:01:11.500> down<00:01:11.740> look<00:01:12.189> at<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.369> cameras<00:01:12.850> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
PS to come down look at the cameras and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.050 
PS to come down look at the cameras and
then<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.350> know<00:01:14.469> I<00:01:14.609> understand<00:01:15.609> what<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:15.880> cab

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
then you know I understand what the cab

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060 
then you know I understand what the cab

great<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.119> have<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.329> camera<00:01:58.630> here<00:01:58.749> is

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
great to have this camera here is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.949 
great to have this camera here is

as this one so that's why I've come
along<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.730> look<00:04:10.760> at<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.150> see<00:04:11.300> what<00:04:11.480> it's

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
along to look at it and see what it's

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.390 
along to look at it and see what it's
all<00:04:11.660> about<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.170> yeah<00:04:12.650> if<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:12.860> was<00:04:12.980> proposed<00:04:13.310> to

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
all about and yeah if I was proposed to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.510 
all about and yeah if I was proposed to
use<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.760> camera<00:04:14.000> then<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:15.770> wouldn't<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.489> would

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
use this camera then I wouldn't it would

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.949 
use this camera then I wouldn't it would
be<00:04:16.700> just<00:04:16.820> about<00:04:17.090> learning<00:04:17.270> how<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.630> use<00:04:17.780> that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
be just about learning how to use that

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.229 
be just about learning how to use that
to<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.410> best<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:19.280> know<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.459> his<00:04:19.670> best<00:04:19.910> means

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
to the best you know to his best means

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.330 
to the best you know to his best means
and<00:04:20.930> finding<00:04:21.230> out<00:04:21.320> what<00:04:21.500> it's<00:04:21.620> good<00:04:21.860> at<00:04:22.070> what

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
and finding out what it's good at what

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.680 
and finding out what it's good at what
it's<00:04:22.460> bad<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:22.670> like<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.210> would<00:04:23.420> do<00:04:23.570> with

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
it's bad that like you would do with

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.840 
it's bad that like you would do with
anything<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.560> wouldn't<00:04:25.280> necessarily<00:04:25.400> treat

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
anything so I wouldn't necessarily treat

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.790 
anything so I wouldn't necessarily treat
it<00:04:26.000> something<00:04:26.480> i<00:04:26.870> would<00:04:27.170> i<00:04:27.200> would<00:04:27.350> try<00:04:27.770> to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
it something i would i would try to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.440 
it something i would i would try to
embrace<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.310> basically<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.790> trying<00:04:29.000> yeah<00:04:29.240> get

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
embrace it basically and trying yeah get

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.240 
embrace it basically and trying yeah get
on<00:04:29.510> with<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.710> see<00:04:30.830> what<00:04:31.010> it's<00:04:31.130> all<00:04:31.190> about

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
on with in and see what it's all about

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.550 
on with in and see what it's all about
so<00:04:31.610> but<00:04:31.730> i<00:04:31.760> think<00:04:31.970> he's<00:04:32.090> going<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.300> be

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
so but i think he's going to be

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.430 
so but i think he's going to be
imperative<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.830> get<00:04:34.330> rolling<00:04:35.330> with<00:04:35.570> with<00:04:36.080> HD

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
imperative to get rolling with with HD

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.470 
imperative to get rolling with with HD
basically<00:04:36.950> if<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.190> decide<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:38.000> not<00:04:38.210> get

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
basically if you decide to not get

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.180 
basically if you decide to not get
involved<00:04:38.750> or<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.260> distance<00:04:39.620> yourself<00:04:39.950> from<00:04:40.010> it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
involved or to distance yourself from it

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.610 
involved or to distance yourself from it
you're<00:04:40.940> going<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.210> be<00:04:41.300> left<00:04:41.510> left<00:04:41.960> behind<00:04:42.320> on

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
you're going to be left left behind on

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.590 
you're going to be left left behind on
with<00:04:43.250> some<00:04:43.460> projects<00:04:43.970> not<00:04:44.090> with<00:04:44.240> everything

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
with some projects not with everything

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.540 
with some projects not with everything
other<00:04:44.810> think<00:04:45.020> is<00:04:45.080> going<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.320> replace<00:04:45.550> film

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
other think is going to replace film

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.730 
other think is going to replace film
entirely<00:04:47.450> for<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.660> long<00:04:47.870> time<00:04:48.140> i<00:04:48.380> hope<00:04:48.530> it

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
entirely for a long time i hope it

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.770 
entirely for a long time i hope it
doesn't<00:04:49.070> cuz<00:04:49.160> i<00:04:49.220> think<00:04:49.430> film<00:04:50.240> as<00:04:50.420> displacement

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
doesn't cuz i think film as displacement

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.170 
doesn't cuz i think film as displacement
I<00:04:51.200> prefer<00:04:52.010> at<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.460> moment<00:04:52.790> generally<00:04:53.120> in

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
I prefer at the moment generally in

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.300 
I prefer at the moment generally in
terms<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.420> how<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.690> looked<00:04:53.900> but<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:54.530> think<00:04:54.950> HD

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
terms of how it looked but I think HD

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.790 
terms of how it looked but I think HD
also<00:04:55.640> can<00:04:55.880> look<00:04:56.090> good<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.480> you<00:04:57.350> can<00:04:57.500> achieve<00:04:57.590> a

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
also can look good and you can achieve a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.670 
also can look good and you can achieve a
look<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.130> you're<00:04:58.190> happy<00:04:58.430> with<00:04:58.700> yeah<00:04:59.380> what<00:05:00.380> my

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
look that you're happy with yeah what my

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.410 
look that you're happy with yeah what my
limited<00:05:01.040> experience<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:01.580> therefore<00:05:02.090> it's

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
limited experience and therefore it's

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.820 
limited experience and therefore it's
about<00:05:02.720> yeah<00:05:02.900> loaning<00:05:03.290> how<00:05:03.410> it's<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:03.770> to

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
about yeah loaning how it's going to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.700 
about yeah loaning how it's going to
work<00:05:03.920> and<00:05:04.310> going<00:05:04.910> with<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.210> well<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.050> f<00:05:06.140> 23<00:05:06.470> is

work and going with it well the f 23 is

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.650 
work and going with it well the f 23 is
just<00:05:06.980> another<00:05:07.310> notch<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.880> on<00:05:08.060> what<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.360> used
