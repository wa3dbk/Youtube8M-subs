00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:37.350 

a<00:02:27.599> mega<00:02:28.599> sack<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.970> should<00:02:34.120> go<00:02:34.209> kill<00:02:36.000> see<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.120> it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
a mega sack you should go kill see it it

a mega sack you should go kill see it it
perfectly<00:02:37.930> works<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:40.030> change<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
perfectly works so just change the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.869 
perfectly works so just change the
sensitivity<00:02:40.629> we<00:02:41.019> need<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:42.159> my<00:02:42.430> sense<00:02:42.700> it

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
sensitivity we need to and my sense it

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.229 
sensitivity we need to and my sense it
was<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.120> someone<00:02:43.510> else<00:02:43.840> rather<00:02:44.829> okay<00:02:45.819> it's

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
was on someone else rather okay it's

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.030 
was on someone else rather okay it's
