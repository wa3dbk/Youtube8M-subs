00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.640 
mega impact reaction command which is
awesome<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.390> probably<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.020> only<00:01:36.050> good<00:01:36.470> way

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
awesome and probably the only good way

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.410 
awesome and probably the only good way
to<00:01:36.710> deal<00:01:36.920> damage<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.490> them<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:37.970> make<00:01:38.180> sure<00:01:38.210> you

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
to deal damage to them so make sure you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.390 
to deal damage to them so make sure you
do<00:01:38.510> that<00:01:38.720> if<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.350> do<00:01:39.530> happen<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:40.040> miss<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
do that if you do happen to miss the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.100 
do that if you do happen to miss the
first<00:01:40.520> time<00:01:40.790> that's<00:01:41.000> okay<00:01:41.120> for<00:01:41.720> now<00:01:41.780> because

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
first time that's okay for now because

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.960 
first time that's okay for now because
it's<00:01:42.260> power<00:01:42.410> bar<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:42.890> low<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.700> make<00:01:43.940> sure

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
it's power bar is so low but make sure

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.400 
it's power bar is so low but make sure
for<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.390> future<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.810> don't<00:01:45.050> and<00:01:45.260> you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
for the future that you don't and you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.320 
for the future that you don't and you
have<00:01:45.560> awesome<00:01:45.860> timing<00:01:46.370> because<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.970> can

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
have awesome timing because this can

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.880 
have awesome timing because this can
one-hit<00:01:47.750> ko<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:48.110> later<00:01:48.320> when<00:01:48.530> his<00:01:48.710> power

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
one-hit ko you later when his power

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.910 
one-hit ko you later when his power
level<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.460> over<00:01:49.810> I'm<00:01:50.810> not<00:01:50.870> gonna<00:01:51.080> say<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.500> when

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
level is over I'm not gonna say it when

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680 
level is over I'm not gonna say it when
it's<00:01:52.070> really<00:01:52.250> high<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:52.880> be<00:01:53.090> careful<00:01:53.450> he's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
it's really high so be careful he's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.970 
it's really high so be careful he's
going<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.020> counter-attack<00:01:54.290> right<00:01:54.740> away<00:01:54.920> so

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
going to counter-attack right away so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.770 
going to counter-attack right away so
make<00:01:55.250> sure<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.490> use<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.760> reflect<00:01:56.210> just<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.660> I

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
make sure you use a reflect just like I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.180 
make sure you use a reflect just like I
did<00:01:56.930> right<00:01:57.110> there<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:57.470> really<00:01:57.770> important

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
did right there it's really important

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.620 
did right there it's really important
otherwise<00:01:58.310> he<00:01:58.700> will<00:01:58.790> do<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:58.940> lot<00:01:59.180> of<00:01:59.330> damage<00:01:59.600> to

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
otherwise he will do a lot of damage to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.570 
otherwise he will do a lot of damage to
you<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.080> here's<00:02:00.530> where<00:02:00.740> he<00:02:00.800> starts<00:02:01.040> his<00:02:01.159> combo

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
you and here's where he starts his combo

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.710 
you and here's where he starts his combo
if<00:02:01.730> you<00:02:01.820> look<00:02:01.940> at<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.120> table<00:02:02.270> oh<00:02:02.360> he<00:02:02.480> does<00:02:02.600> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
if you look at this table oh he does it

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.250 
if you look at this table oh he does it
in<00:02:02.810> three<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.950> goes<00:02:04.130> one<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.050> and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
in three so it goes one like that and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.630 
in three so it goes one like that and
then<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.500> reflect<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:07.010> match<00:02:07.220> reflect

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
then you reflect just match reflect

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.339 
then you reflect just match reflect
twice<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:08.209> pause<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.929> then<00:02:09.019> wait<00:02:09.200> for

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
twice and then pause and then wait for

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.600 
twice and then pause and then wait for
the<00:02:09.409> third<00:02:09.560> time<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.009> press<00:02:10.159> reflect

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
the third time and then press reflect

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.280 
the third time and then press reflect
one<00:02:10.789> more<00:02:10.940> time<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.390> you'll<00:02:11.780> leave<00:02:11.930> them<00:02:12.080> open

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
one more time and you'll leave them open

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.059 
one more time and you'll leave them open
to<00:02:12.560> attacks<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.580> look<00:02:13.880> right<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.300> after

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
to attacks you can look right here after

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.250 
to attacks you can look right here after
third<00:02:15.370> attack<00:02:15.760> he<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.209> vulnerable<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.840> an<00:02:17.049> air

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
third attack he is vulnerable to an air

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
with your Keyblade and you should be

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.110 
with your Keyblade and you should be
good<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.010> go<00:02:21.159> with<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.340> lot<00:02:21.549> of<00:02:21.670> damage<00:02:21.939> so<00:02:21.969> far

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
good to go with a lot of damage so far

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.030 
good to go with a lot of damage so far
okay<00:02:22.659> so<00:02:22.719> now<00:02:22.989> begins<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.469> second<00:02:23.859> wave<00:02:24.010> of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
okay so now begins the second wave of

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.920 
okay so now begins the second wave of
the<00:02:24.280> fight<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.450> be<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.599> little<00:02:25.840> bit

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the fight this can be a little bit

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.629 
the fight this can be a little bit
challenging<00:02:26.139> here<00:02:26.650> his<00:02:26.859> attacks<00:02:27.280> change<00:02:27.549> a

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
challenging here his attacks change a

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.369 
challenging here his attacks change a
lot<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.969> boost<00:02:28.120> his<00:02:28.239> power<00:02:28.420> up<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.629> 30,000<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
lot you boost his power up to 30,000 and

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.780 
lot you boost his power up to 30,000 and
then<00:02:29.530> he's<00:02:29.650> going<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.859> run<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.159> you<00:02:30.249> you<00:02:30.670> need

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
then he's going to run at you you need

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.640 
then he's going to run at you you need
to<00:02:30.819> reflect<00:02:31.269> that<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.689> soon<00:02:32.049> as<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.319> see<00:02:32.560> it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
to reflect that as soon as you see it

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.800 
to reflect that as soon as you see it
that<00:02:33.189> is<00:02:33.340> extremely<00:02:33.909> important<00:02:34.480> because<00:02:34.599> if

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that is extremely important because if

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.479 
that is extremely important because if
you<00:02:34.989> don't<00:02:35.200> use<00:02:35.379> going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> launch<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.920> here

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
you don't use going to launch you here

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.490 
you don't use going to launch you here
it<00:02:36.609> is<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:36.849> slow<00:02:37.060> motion<00:02:37.239> just<00:02:37.810> reflects<00:02:38.260> there

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it is in slow motion just reflects there

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.929 
it is in slow motion just reflects there
that<00:02:38.769> way<00:02:38.889> you<00:02:38.950> can't<00:02:39.159> do<00:02:39.250> anything<00:02:39.579> to<00:02:39.730> you

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
that way you can't do anything to you

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.240 
that way you can't do anything to you
with<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.239> charge<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.840> that's<00:02:41.829> good<00:02:42.069> because

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
with that charge and that's good because

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.830 
with that charge and that's good because
that<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.730> easily<00:02:43.030> kill<00:02:43.480> you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
that can easily kill you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.869 
that can easily kill you
here's<00:02:44.349> what<00:02:44.499> happens<00:02:44.799> if<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.099> don't<00:02:45.280> reflect

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
here's what happens if you don't reflect

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.270 
here's what happens if you don't reflect
here<00:02:46.299> if<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.200> try<00:02:47.379> guarding<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:47.980> know<00:02:48.069> it's

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
here if you try guarding you know it's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.259 
here if you try guarding you know it's
not<00:02:48.400> going<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.639> work<00:02:48.700> you're<00:02:48.969> just<00:02:49.120> going<00:02:49.239> to

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
not going to work you're just going to

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.209 
not going to work you're just going to
launch<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.719> into<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.109> ground<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.709> then<00:02:50.889> just

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
launch you into the ground and then just

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.129 
launch you into the ground and then just
hammer<00:02:51.669> you<00:02:51.939> back<00:02:52.299> down<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.689> the<00:02:52.810> ground<00:02:52.959> again

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
hammer you back down to the ground again

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.259 
hammer you back down to the ground again
it's<00:02:53.469> scary<00:02:53.859> so<00:02:54.189> he<00:02:54.579> also<00:02:54.730> has<00:02:54.909> a<00:02:54.939> second

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
it's scary so he also has a second

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.849 
it's scary so he also has a second
attack<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.569> which<00:02:55.689> he<00:02:55.810> turns<00:02:56.079> around<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.680> then

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
attack in which he turns around and then

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.069 
attack in which he turns around and then
hammers<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.489> right<00:02:57.849> into<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.120> pillar<00:02:58.389> that<00:02:58.930> can

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
hammers you right into a pillar that can

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.020 
hammers you right into a pillar that can
leave<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.349> with<00:02:59.439> one<00:02:59.620> HP<00:03:00.010> watch<00:03:00.669> as<00:03:00.790> he<00:03:00.879> does

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
leave you with one HP watch as he does

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.520 
leave you with one HP watch as he does
his<00:03:01.180> twirl<00:03:01.540> that's<00:03:01.840> how<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.139> he's<00:03:02.319> about

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
his twirl that's how you know he's about

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.129 
his twirl that's how you know he's about
to<00:03:02.739> throw<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.489> be<00:03:04.090> careful<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.900> can't

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
to throw you so be careful you can't

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.539 
to throw you so be careful you can't
guard<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.469> either<00:03:05.709> that's<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.159> only<00:03:06.400> other

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
guard that either that's the only other

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.879 
guard that either that's the only other
case<00:03:06.760> where<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> reflect<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.349> only<00:03:08.739> way<00:03:08.829> you

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
case where a reflect is the only way you

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.740 
case where a reflect is the only way you
can<00:03:09.069> deal<00:03:09.280> with<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.579> so<00:03:09.790> yeah<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.299> just<00:03:10.510> make

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
can deal with it so yeah I just make

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.000 
can deal with it so yeah I just make
sure<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.959> reflected<00:03:11.319> as<00:03:11.409> soon<00:03:11.620> as<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.859> see

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
sure you reflected as soon as you see

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.270 
sure you reflected as soon as you see
him<00:03:12.099> spin<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.669> is<00:03:12.819> extremely<00:03:13.659> important<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
him spin that is extremely important so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.309 
him spin that is extremely important so
after<00:03:15.639> he<00:03:15.730> gets<00:03:15.879> down<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.090> about<00:03:16.359> under<00:03:17.019> three

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
after he gets down to about under three

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.899 
after he gets down to about under three
bars<00:03:17.560> he's<00:03:17.769> going<00:03:17.949> to<00:03:18.040> begin<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.400> third<00:03:18.430> phase

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
bars he's going to begin the third phase

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.789 
bars he's going to begin the third phase
of<00:03:18.939> the<00:03:19.120> fight<00:03:19.359> he's<00:03:19.930> gonna<00:03:20.049> start<00:03:20.650> by

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
of the fight he's gonna start by

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.679 
of the fight he's gonna start by
boosting<00:03:21.129> his<00:03:21.189> power<00:03:21.459> level<00:03:21.729> up<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.819> 60,000

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
boosting his power level up to 60,000

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.330 
boosting his power level up to 60,000
and<00:03:22.840> then<00:03:23.019> launching<00:03:23.590> up<00:03:23.709> into<00:03:23.889> the<00:03:24.009> air<00:03:24.129> and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
and then launching up into the air and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.129 
and then launching up into the air and
then<00:03:24.459> crashing<00:03:25.000> back<00:03:25.150> down<00:03:25.180> towards<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.840> you

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
then crashing back down towards you you

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.929 
then crashing back down towards you you
need<00:03:26.259> to<00:03:26.409> guard<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.859> with<00:03:26.919> excellent<00:03:27.579> timing

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
need to guard this with excellent timing

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.659 
need to guard this with excellent timing
and<00:03:28.090> then<00:03:28.449> do<00:03:28.629> a<00:03:28.659> three<00:03:28.989> reflect<00:03:29.439> combo<00:03:29.949> it's<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
and then do a three reflect combo it's a

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.890 
and then do a three reflect combo it's a
little<00:03:30.909> bit<00:03:31.000> tricky<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.329> first<00:03:31.479> time<00:03:31.659> to<00:03:31.780> get

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
little bit tricky the first time to get

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.869 
little bit tricky the first time to get
used<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.169> timing<00:03:32.409> but<00:03:32.949> it's<00:03:33.459> not<00:03:33.699> that

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
used to the timing but it's not that

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.300 
used to the timing but it's not that
hard<00:03:34.060> once<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.359> get<00:03:34.479> some<00:03:34.599> practice

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
hard once you get some practice

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.379 
hard once you get some practice
okay<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.370> let's<00:03:36.639> watch<00:03:36.759> this<00:03:36.939> in<00:03:37.060> slow<00:03:37.209> motion

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
okay so let's watch this in slow motion

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.670 
okay so let's watch this in slow motion
one<00:03:37.659> more<00:03:37.810> time<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.259> so<00:03:38.319> you<00:03:38.379> get<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> idea

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
one more time just so you get the idea

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.009 
one more time just so you get the idea
of<00:03:39.129> it<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.819> he<00:03:39.970> launches<00:03:40.299> himself<00:03:40.449> up<00:03:40.750> into<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
of it so he launches himself up into the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.039 
of it so he launches himself up into the
air<00:03:42.419> we<00:03:43.419> comes<00:03:43.810> down<00:03:44.049> need<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.680> guard<00:03:44.829> now<00:03:45.129> and

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
air we comes down need to guard now and

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.809 
air we comes down need to guard now and
then<00:03:47.049> do<00:03:47.290> three<00:03:47.590> reflects<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.489> should<00:03:48.699> it

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
then do three reflects so you should it

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.520 
then do three reflects so you should it
should<00:03:48.849> be<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> full<00:03:49.329> combo<00:03:49.599> of<00:03:49.900> reflect<00:03:50.290> and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
should be a full combo of reflect and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.710 
should be a full combo of reflect and
that<00:03:51.099> will<00:03:51.280> stop<00:03:51.519> any<00:03:51.729> attacks<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.329> he'll<00:03:52.509> do

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
that will stop any attacks that he'll do

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.140 
that will stop any attacks that he'll do
to<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.079> after<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> crash<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:54.159> then<00:03:54.759> after

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
to you after the crash and then after

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.089 
to you after the crash and then after
that's<00:03:55.269> done<00:03:55.599> he's<00:03:56.530> going<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.859> start

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
that's done he's going to start

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.349 
that's done he's going to start
attacking<00:03:57.310> immediately<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:57.909> do<00:03:58.030> one<00:03:58.180> last

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
attacking immediately so do one last

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.429 
attacking immediately so do one last
four<00:03:58.689> and<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.989> should<00:03:59.259> be<00:03:59.349> able

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
four and then you should be able

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.110 
four and then you should be able
to<00:03:59.530> mega<00:03:59.709> impact<00:04:00.129> him<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.459> get<00:04:00.699> on<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.969> more

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
to mega impact him and get on to more

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.059 
to mega impact him and get on to more
damage<00:04:01.299> those<00:04:02.109> are<00:04:02.259> all<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.379> those<00:04:02.530> mechanics

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
damage those are all of those mechanics

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.170 
damage those are all of those mechanics
now<00:04:03.340> let's<00:04:03.549> take<00:04:03.639> a<00:04:03.699> look<00:04:03.790> at<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:03.969> full

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
now let's take a look at the full

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.929 
now let's take a look at the full
uninterrupted<00:04:04.900> fight<00:04:05.489> alright<00:04:06.489> here<00:04:06.669> we<00:04:06.699> go

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
uninterrupted fight alright here we go

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.819 
uninterrupted fight alright here we go
so<00:04:07.689> this<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:07.989> going<00:04:08.079> to<00:04:08.169> be<00:04:08.259> no<00:04:08.469> damage

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
so this is going to be no damage

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.009 
so this is going to be no damage
whatsoever<00:04:09.069> taken<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:10.419> literally<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
whatsoever taken it's literally the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.809 
whatsoever taken it's literally the
perfect<00:04:11.469> way<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.620> beat<00:04:11.829> them<00:04:11.979> so<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:12.639> run

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
perfect way to beat them so you run

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.249 
perfect way to beat them so you run
towards<00:04:13.120> them<00:04:13.209> you<00:04:13.389> guard<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.780> first<00:04:13.959> attack

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:14.259 
towards them you guard the first attack

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.199 
towards them you guard the first attack
mega<00:04:14.949> impacts<00:04:15.370> there<00:04:15.759> we<00:04:15.879> go

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
mega impacts there we go

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.199 
mega impacts there we go
now<00:04:16.329> can<00:04:16.509> get<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.630> combo<00:04:16.989> in

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
now can get a combo in

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.099 
now can get a combo in
BAM<00:04:19.169> oh<00:04:19.199> it's<00:04:19.530> awesome<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.919> love<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.539> and<00:04:21.539> I

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.930 
BAM oh it's awesome I love it and I
remember<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.560> reflect<00:04:23.220> as<00:04:23.430> soon<00:04:23.580> as<00:04:23.699> he<00:04:23.759> comes

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
remember to reflect as soon as he comes

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.249 
remember to reflect as soon as he comes
back<00:04:24.090> down<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.600> now<00:04:24.780> he's<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.080> start

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
back down and now he's going to start

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.840 
back down and now he's going to start
his<00:04:25.380> combos<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:26.220> two<00:04:27.090> paws<00:04:27.960> three<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.919> that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
his combos one two paws three and that

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.980 
his combos one two paws three and that
leaves<00:04:30.000> him<00:04:30.150> vulnerable<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.750> can<00:04:30.840> start

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
leaves him vulnerable so you can start

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.409 
leaves him vulnerable so you can start
attacking<00:04:31.259> them<00:04:31.440> once<00:04:31.650> again<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.160> now<00:04:33.090> he's

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
attacking them once again and now he's

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.779 
attacking them once again and now he's
going<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.600> go<00:04:33.720> into<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.930> second<00:04:34.289> phase<00:04:34.789> so

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
going to go into a second phase so

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.810 
going to go into a second phase so
remember<00:04:36.060> we<00:04:36.150> have<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.360> reflect<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.110> charge

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
remember we have to reflect the charge

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.820 
remember we have to reflect the charge
BAM<00:04:38.820> there<00:04:39.240> we<00:04:39.360> go<00:04:39.509> so<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.020> totally<00:04:40.440> knows<00:04:40.620> it

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
BAM there we go so that totally knows it

into<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.520> flow<00:04:47.729> of<00:04:47.759> it<00:04:47.940> just<00:04:48.180> make<00:04:48.419> sure<00:04:48.600> that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
into the flow of it just make sure that

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.420 
into the flow of it just make sure that
you<00:04:48.960> watch<00:04:49.139> your<00:04:49.350> MPC<00:04:49.620> I'm<00:04:49.979> refilling<00:04:50.400> my

the<00:04:57.870> sixty<00:04:58.259> thousand<00:04:58.620> range<00:04:58.800> once<00:04:59.039> it's<00:04:59.190> about

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
the sixty thousand range once it's about

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.999 
the sixty thousand range once it's about
to<00:04:59.430> start<00:04:59.669> that<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.270> should<00:05:00.479> be<00:05:00.599> very<00:05:00.870> soon<00:05:01.169> one

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
to start that it should be very soon one

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.980 
to start that it should be very soon one
two<00:05:03.000> paws<00:05:03.750> three<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:06.240> then<00:05:06.419> just<00:05:06.630> do<00:05:06.780> another

combo<00:05:07.320> on<00:05:07.440> them<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:08.400> should<00:05:08.430> get<00:05:08.729> them<00:05:08.849> into

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
combo on them this should get them into

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.210 
combo on them this should get them into
the<00:05:09.360> sixty<00:05:09.780> thousand<00:05:10.139> range<00:05:11.150> almost<00:05:12.150> not<00:05:12.539> yet

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
the sixty thousand range almost not yet

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.779 
the sixty thousand range almost not yet
here<00:05:14.220> he<00:05:14.340> goes

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
here he goes

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.310 
here he goes
