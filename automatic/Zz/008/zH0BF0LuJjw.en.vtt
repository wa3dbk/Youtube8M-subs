00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
then up here ties rip the cord

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.310 
then up here ties rip the cord
technology<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.730> say<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.899> need<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> like

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
technology and so say they need to like

and rip it off and then it splits your
shoulder<00:01:05.939> pads<00:01:06.119> into<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.979> like

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
thing that I like about these pads is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
thing that I like about these pads is
everything<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.939> velcro<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.439> thing

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
everything is velcro and then one thing

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.200 
everything is velcro and then one thing
I<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.220> these<00:01:17.549> pads<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I don't like about these pads that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.780 
I don't like about these pads that
everything<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.869> velcro<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.580> good

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
everything is velcro and so the good

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.410 
everything is velcro and so the good
things<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:22.310> it's<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.729> easy<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
things I like is it's pretty easy to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.490 
things I like is it's pretty easy to
clean<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.979> whole<00:01:26.479> like<00:01:27.500> shoulder

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
clean and so this whole like shoulder

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.819 
clean and so this whole like shoulder
part<00:01:28.799> comes<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:30.320> these<00:01:31.320> four

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
part comes out and then these four

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.740 
part comes out and then these four
pieces<00:01:33.079> say<00:01:34.079> where<00:01:34.320> they<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.920> side<00:01:35.030> so

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.450 

it's<00:01:42.750> kind<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> hard<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.500> with<00:01:43.890> black<00:01:44.250> on

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it's kind of hard to see with black on

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's kind of hard to see with black on
black<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.030> goes<00:01:45.750> behind<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.290> shoulder<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
black but goes behind the shoulder and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.030 
black but goes behind the shoulder and
then<00:01:47.520> once<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.939> frame<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> shoulder<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.860> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
then once we frame the shoulder but I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.600 
then once we frame the shoulder but I
took<00:01:50.280> those<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.810> before<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.829> my

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
took those out just so they before so my

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.830 
took those out just so they before so my
home<00:01:54.200> motion<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.680> neck<00:01:55.920> turning<00:01:56.509> his<00:01:57.509> back<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
home motion my neck turning his back to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.649 
home motion my neck turning his back to
the<00:01:58.079> front<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.590> these<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.310> pets<00:01:59.659> that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the front there are these two pets that

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
the front there are these two pets that
I<00:02:00.840> took<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.439> probably<00:02:01.649> gonna<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.280> left

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
I took up I'm probably gonna put my left

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.289 
I took up I'm probably gonna put my left
one<00:02:02.820> back<00:02:03.030> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
one back on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.510 
one back on
just<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.710> quarter<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.460> don't

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
just because this quarter back I don't

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.359 
just because this quarter back I don't
want<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.170> full<00:02:07.409> motion<00:02:07.680> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
want my right one to have full motion so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.059 
want my right one to have full motion so
I'll<00:02:08.489> probably<00:02:08.700> put<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.270> left<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.319> on<00:02:10.500> just

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
I'll probably put the left going on just

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.840 
I'll probably put the left going on just
so<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> has<00:02:11.580> protection<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.330> my<00:02:12.360> blind

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
so it has protection on my blind

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.500 
so it has protection on my blind
side<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:14.320> I'll<00:02:15.220> show<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.490> where<00:02:15.700> these

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
side and then I'll show you where these

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.930 
side and then I'll show you where these
go<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.560> where<00:02:17.740> they<00:02:17.920> go<00:02:18.130> it's<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:18.490> in<00:02:18.760> all

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
go this is where they go it's not in all

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.930 
go this is where they go it's not in all
the<00:02:19.150> way<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.440> edge<00:02:20.740> mark<00:02:21.280> should<00:02:21.790> go

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
the way but this edge mark should go

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.800 
the way but this edge mark should go
into<00:02:22.120> here

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
into here

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.570 
into here
and<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.740> basically<00:02:24.130> protects<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.160> front

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and so basically protects like the front

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.740 
and so basically protects like the front
of<00:02:27.670> your<00:02:27.820> shoulder<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:29.220> part<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.430> your<00:02:31.120> outside

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
of your shoulder in part of your outside

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.250 
of your shoulder in part of your outside
chest<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.850> your<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.150> shoulder<00:02:34.840> parts

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
chest and your the shoulder parts

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.620 
chest and your the shoulder parts
there's<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:36.640> foot<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.360> top<00:02:38.820> just<00:02:39.820> like

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
there's one foot on the top just like

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.890 
there's one foot on the top just like
most<00:02:40.930> shoulder<00:02:41.380> pads<00:02:42.030> mm-hmm<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:43.660> go<00:02:43.870> out

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
most shoulder pads mm-hmm so they go out

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.430 
most shoulder pads mm-hmm so they go out
wide<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.730> they're<00:02:45.910> not<00:02:46.180> wrong<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.960> if<00:02:47.260> you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
wide but they're not wrong so if you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.130 
wide but they're not wrong so if you
find<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.860> tight<00:02:48.100> jersey<00:02:48.640> those<00:02:49.420> squeeze<00:02:49.840> down

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
find a tight jersey those squeeze down

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.590 
find a tight jersey those squeeze down
like<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.890> you'll<00:02:51.160> have<00:02:51.310> lots<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.330> range

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
like that so you'll have lots of range

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.450 
like that so you'll have lots of range
of<00:02:52.720> motion<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.500> would<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.740> smaller

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
of motion and it would be smaller

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.940 
of motion and it would be smaller
looking<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.180> body<00:02:55.680> one<00:02:56.680> thing<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
looking on your body one thing that I

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.010 
looking on your body one thing that I
think<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.910> might<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.060> because<00:03:01.300> I'm<00:03:01.660> wearing<00:03:01.870> a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
think it might be because I'm wearing a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.440 
think it might be because I'm wearing a
loose<00:03:02.230> jersey<00:03:02.740> right<00:03:02.860> now<00:03:03.070> but<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.030> pawn<00:03:04.270> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
loose jersey right now but I pawn it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.760 
loose jersey right now but I pawn it
tighter<00:03:04.660> Jersey<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.140> don't<00:03:05.320> know<00:03:05.440> if<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.650> would

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
tighter Jersey I don't know if I would

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.610 
tighter Jersey I don't know if I would
have<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.130> problem<00:03:06.430> but<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:08.080> only<00:03:08.290> happen

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
have this problem but it's only happen

throwing a quick slants in like three

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.640 
throwing a quick slants in like three
times<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.720> row<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.170> don't<00:03:14.410> know<00:03:14.500> what

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
times in a row I don't know what

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
times in a row I don't know what
happened<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.960> part<00:03:17.350> well<00:03:18.010> cuz<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.460> need<00:03:18.520> a

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
happened but this part well cuz I need a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.390 
happened but this part well cuz I need a
reason<00:03:18.880> I'm<00:03:19.240> up<00:03:19.330> I<00:03:19.540> came<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.080> higher<00:03:20.380> but<00:03:21.250> then

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
reason I'm up I came up higher but then

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880 
reason I'm up I came up higher but then
I<00:03:21.610> think<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.150> was<00:03:22.300> this<00:03:22.540> neck<00:03:23.020> part<00:03:23.350> right<00:03:23.530> here

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
I think it was this neck part right here

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.660 
I think it was this neck part right here
jammed<00:03:24.760> up<00:03:25.060> into<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:26.470> upper<00:03:27.370> part<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.610> my

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
jammed up into the like upper part of my

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.270 
jammed up into the like upper part of my
helmet<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.240> when<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.480> threw<00:03:28.810> my<00:03:29.380> whole<00:03:29.680> helmet

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
helmet so when I threw my whole helmet

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.000 
helmet so when I threw my whole helmet
or<00:03:30.550> my<00:03:30.820> head<00:03:31.120> basically<00:03:31.840> turned<00:03:32.470> all<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:32.890> way

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
or my head basically turned all the way

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.680 
or my head basically turned all the way
sideways<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.820> just<00:03:34.030> felt<00:03:34.240> really<00:03:34.450> weird

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
sideways and it just felt really weird

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.500 
sideways and it just felt really weird
but<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.890> haven't<00:03:36.100> had<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.520> happened<00:03:36.880> since

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510

we've been like scrimmaging and around
employees<00:03:39.540> right<00:03:40.540> here<00:03:40.720> there<00:03:40.960> are<00:03:41.080> two<00:03:41.290> bands

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
employees right here there are two bands

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.640 
employees right here there are two bands
in<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:41.920> middle<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.390> like<00:03:43.840> say<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.410> get

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
in the middle so you like say you get

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.770 
in the middle so you like say you get
hit<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.970> left<00:03:46.420> shoulder<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:47.800> rule<00:03:48.040> like

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
hit on this left shoulder this rule like

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.010 
hit on this left shoulder this rule like
push<00:03:49.780> up<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.770> so<00:03:51.100> your<00:03:52.060> pads<00:03:52.360> aren't<00:03:52.780> like

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
push up and so your pads aren't like

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.620 
push up and so your pads aren't like
stiff<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.800> if<00:03:54.010> they<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> lot<00:03:55.330> of<00:03:55.360> motion

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
stiff and if they have a lot of motion

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.810 
stiff and if they have a lot of motion
and<00:03:55.930> move<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:56.980> ability<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.490> what<00:03:57.670> you're

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
and move to the ability of what you're

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.750 
and move to the ability of what you're
doing<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:59.470> like<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.800> guys<00:03:59.950> know<00:04:00.220> these<00:04:00.550> are

doing just like you guys know these are

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.600 
doing just like you guys know these are
size<00:04:01.390> extra<00:04:01.900> small<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.530> reason<00:04:03.130> why<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.280> got

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
also the ride out power just like the

also the ride out power just like the
same<00:04:53.100> brand<00:04:53.760> marketing<00:04:54.240> as<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.600> shoulder

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
same brand marketing as the shoulder

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.790 
same brand marketing as the shoulder
pads<00:04:55.200> so<00:04:55.980> back<00:04:56.220> here<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.550> has<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:57.290> hard<00:04:58.290> plated

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
pads so back here it has a hard plated

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.210 
pads so back here it has a hard plated
shell<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.610> says<00:04:59.820> Riedel<00:05:00.180> power<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.780> then<00:05:01.440> it

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
shell that says Riedel power and then it

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.060 
shell that says Riedel power and then it
has<00:05:02.430> three<00:05:02.970> settings<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.440> if<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.740> want<00:05:04.950> it

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
has three settings so if you want it

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.950 
has three settings so if you want it
lower<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.640> have<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:05.970> on<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.180> middle<00:05:06.330> one<00:05:06.600> then

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
lower I have it on the middle one then

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.510 
lower I have it on the middle one then
you<00:05:07.050> can<00:05:07.200> low<00:05:08.010> middle<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.910> then<00:05:09.210> hire<00:05:10.520> all

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
you can low middle and then hire all

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.780 
you can low middle and then hire all
these<00:05:12.090> are<00:05:13.400> like<00:05:15.320> take<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.530> off<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:17.010> think

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
these are like take that off I think

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.720 
these are like take that off I think
it's<00:05:17.940> mainly<00:05:18.270> for<00:05:18.750> cleaning<00:05:19.200> purposes<00:05:19.730> and

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
it's mainly for cleaning purposes and

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.260 
it's mainly for cleaning purposes and
take<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.300> one<00:05:21.510> off<00:05:21.690> but<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:23.730> one<00:05:23.910> thing<00:05:24.150> I

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
take this one off but the one thing I

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.720 
take this one off but the one thing I
wish<00:05:24.510> they<00:05:24.780> did<00:05:25.020> was<00:05:25.380> made<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.160> where<00:05:26.430> he<00:05:26.520> could

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
wish they did was made it where he could

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.850 
wish they did was made it where he could
take<00:05:27.210> them<00:05:27.390> all<00:05:27.660> off<00:05:27.690> even<00:05:28.500> though<00:05:28.650> they'd

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
take them all off even though they'd

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.050 
take them all off even though they'd
probably<00:05:29.160> come<00:05:29.580> undone<00:05:29.940> just<00:05:30.240> cuz<00:05:31.520> like<00:05:32.520> I'm

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
probably come undone just cuz like I'm

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.280 
probably come undone just cuz like I'm
firing<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:34.080> ribs<00:05:34.380> but<00:05:35.450> if<00:05:36.450> I<00:05:36.690> could<00:05:36.900> take<00:05:37.080> off

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
firing the ribs but if I could take off

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.650 
firing the ribs but if I could take off
this<00:05:37.560> one<00:05:37.830> where<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.400> just<00:05:38.490> had<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.090> back<00:05:39.300> plate

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
this one where I just had the back plate

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.300 
this one where I just had the back plate
then<00:05:40.410> I'd<00:05:41.160> like<00:05:41.670> that<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.910> lot<00:05:42.120> more<00:05:42.450> because

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
then I'd like that a lot more because

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.880 
then I'd like that a lot more because
say<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.340> just<00:05:44.400> learned<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.850> back<00:05:45.060> point

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:57.450 

no<00:05:51.300> 99.1<00:05:52.300> image<00:05:53.230> of<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.650> shoulder<00:05:54.280> pads<00:05:54.520> on<00:05:56.460> so

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
no 99.1 image of the shoulder pads on so

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.980 
no 99.1 image of the shoulder pads on so
you<00:05:57.580> can<00:05:57.760> see<00:05:57.910> if<00:05:58.030> there's<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.330> tape<00:05:58.540> Jersey

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
you can see if there's a tape Jersey

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.800 
you can see if there's a tape Jersey
it's<00:05:59.110> gonna<00:05:59.400> squeeze<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:00.520> tightly<00:06:00.790> over<00:06:00.970> your

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810
