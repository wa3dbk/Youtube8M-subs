00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and let's start comparing something so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.980 
and let's start comparing something so
the<00:01:17.159> total<00:01:17.430> ammo<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> ak-47<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:20.990> 240

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

the total ammo for the ak-47 is 240
bullets<00:01:22.590> plus<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.220> xxx<00:01:23.580> ammo<00:01:23.880> per<00:01:24.330> clip

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bullets plus your xxx ammo per clip

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.280 
bullets plus your xxx ammo per clip
while<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> Tommy<00:01:26.400> gun<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.290> 350

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

keep hitting the box if you run out of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.139 
keep hitting the box if you run out of
ammo<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.810> even<00:02:04.320> pack<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> bunch<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
ammo or even pack a bunch it but for the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.600 
ammo or even pack a bunch it but for the
tommy<00:02:06.390> gun<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.899> only<00:02:07.079> 600<00:02:07.770> points<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.340> for

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
tommy gun it's only 600 points so for

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.609 
tommy gun it's only 600 points so for
ammo<00:02:08.819> wise<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.390> definitely<00:02:09.929> see<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.170> tommy

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
ammo wise I definitely see that tommy

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.610 
ammo wise I definitely see that tommy
gun<00:02:10.920> has<00:02:11.220> definitely<00:02:11.849> won<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.569> easy<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
gun has definitely won how easy it is to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.940 
gun has definitely won how easy it is to
yet<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.420> ak-47<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> lot<00:02:15.900> closer<00:02:16.319> than<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
yet the ak-47 is a lot closer than the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.820 
yet the ak-47 is a lot closer than the
tommy<00:02:17.220> gun<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.330> definitely<00:02:18.989> would<00:02:19.590> say<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
tommy gun so I definitely would say that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.369 
tommy gun so I definitely would say that
the<00:02:20.159> tommy<00:02:20.430> gun<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:20.970> lot<00:02:21.360> harder<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.019> but

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
the tommy gun is a lot harder to get but

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.369 
the tommy gun is a lot harder to get but
it<00:02:22.530> doesn't<00:02:22.830> cost<00:02:23.129> as<00:02:23.459> much<00:02:23.489> while<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.629> ak-47

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
it doesn't cost as much while the ak-47

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.619 
it doesn't cost as much while the ak-47
is<00:02:25.890> easier<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.209> sorted<00:02:27.540> in

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
is easier to get because it's sorted in

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.020 
is easier to get because it's sorted in
that<00:02:27.810> top<00:02:28.140> part<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.799> mob<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.340> dead<00:02:29.459> while
