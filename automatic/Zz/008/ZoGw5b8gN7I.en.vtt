00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.420
 so enjoy those beautiful images about the moon landing all those pieces in the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.359
 newspapers 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.249
 again apollo henkie last night 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:21.179
 you like a british and loved all those stories about armstrong 3 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.070
 van den buys around it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.300
 I'm enjoying it 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.360
 47 years ago then I was seventeen years old 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.720
 then at least clearly nothing looked at it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.899
 those images were worthless 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.870
 nowadays 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.290
 see you say because moon dust helped and I also understand much better 7 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.949
 than forty years ago 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.330
 what went well and didn't go well 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.900
 I understand that the moon landing was a dime on its side and want that 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.860
 that only one bicolar landing craft was driven by a 75 km computer 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.810
 that is a thousand times as little as a game console, yes, it almost makes sense 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.990
 went wrong 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.510
 I understand the book much better 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 than forty years ago including the Netherlands 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.730
 then I thought yes 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.150
 sink into the moon so it is nice to go there but you have to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.970
 tens of billions of corsts and then later I heard yes as an argument 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.760
 because we went to the moon 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.899
 have the phone 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.559
 got pang then I thought yes that is an expensive Tefalpan 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.080
 the last days are from all sides including the Dutch origin 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.229
 and wubbo ockels professor in delft and famous for his kites 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.470
 because we went to the moon 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.280
 and have discovered there 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.079
 they hit that beautiful blue sphere, the only sphere with colors in the universe 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.130
 but only then when on the moon true 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.979
 Look, I think that's logical 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.130
 just like when you go on vacation the entire bank goes to exotic countries 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.140
 and then you realize how nice it is at home 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.330
 sure that's why we're going to the moon
