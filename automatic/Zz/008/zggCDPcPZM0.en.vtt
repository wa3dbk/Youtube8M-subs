00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and runs off my machine with the special

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.039 
and runs off my machine with the special
chunk<00:02:28.980> because<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.730> machine<00:02:29.909> is<00:02:30.180> fly<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
chunk because this machine is fly to

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.789

priori<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.440> probably<00:03:08.430> lighting<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.760> amazing

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
priori and probably lighting is amazing

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.809 
priori and probably lighting is amazing
you<00:03:09.329> put<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.019> in<00:03:10.200> your<00:03:10.579> back

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
you put it that in your back

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.960 
you put it that in your back
it's<00:03:11.970> only<00:03:12.419> a<00:03:12.540> kite<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.340> said<00:03:14.489> ok<00:03:14.760> I

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
it's only a kite and you you said ok I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.819 
it's only a kite and you you said ok I
don't<00:03:15.209> want<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.630> start<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> run<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.590> keep

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
don't want to start the run and I keep

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.400 
don't want to start the run and I keep
my<00:03:16.980> body<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.790> kite<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.239> say<00:03:18.510> ok<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:19.200> run

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
my body on the kite and say ok just run

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.640 
my body on the kite and say ok just run
and<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.739> fly<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.940> think<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.650> real

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
and you fly and I think that is a real

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.360 
and you fly and I think that is a real
good<00:03:22.680> way<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> understand<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:25.440> element<00:03:25.829> to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
good way to understand the element to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.509 
good way to understand the element to
fly<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.910> after<00:03:27.629> I<00:03:27.690> fly<00:03:27.959> glider<00:03:28.290> plane<00:03:29.099> and

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
fly and after I fly glider plane and

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.650 
fly and after I fly glider plane and
different<00:03:30.419> Stefan<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.590> le<00:03:31.859> copter<00:03:32.340> it's

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
different Stefan but le copter it's

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.770 
different Stefan but le copter it's
probably<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.870> machine<00:03:34.819> everybody<00:03:35.819> who<00:03:36.120> want

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
probably the machine everybody who want

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.349 
probably the machine everybody who want
to<00:03:37.019> use<00:03:37.379> it<00:03:37.620> because<00:03:37.859> you<00:03:38.340> feel<00:03:38.790> your<00:03:38.970> freedom

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
to use it because you feel your freedom

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.659 
to use it because you feel your freedom
is<00:03:39.540> more<00:03:40.530> big<00:03:40.739> because<00:03:41.099> you<00:03:41.160> can<00:03:41.400> take<00:03:41.609> a

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
is more big because you can take a

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.819 
is more big because you can take a
vertical<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.540> back<00:03:42.750> roots<00:03:43.019> left<00:03:43.260> right<00:03:43.590> and

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
vertical go back roots left right and

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.550 
vertical go back roots left right and
that<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.760> incredible<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.199> a<00:03:46.230> trip<00:03:46.530> like

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
that is incredible and to do a trip like

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.119 
that is incredible and to do a trip like
that

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
that

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.199 
that
I<00:03:47.160> see<00:03:47.579> it's<00:03:47.790> less<00:03:48.359> stress<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.349> less<00:03:52.549> risk<00:03:53.549> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
I see it's less stress and less risk to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.000 
I see it's less stress and less risk to
use<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.540> le<00:03:54.780> copter<00:03:55.199> because<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.769> plane

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
use the le copter because with the plane

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.460 
use the le copter because with the plane
with<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> small<00:03:56.699> plane<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.480> go<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.690> airport<00:03:58.049> to

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
with a small plane you go to airport to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.900 
with a small plane you go to airport to
airport<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.980> between<00:03:59.310> airport<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.879> airport

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
airport and between airport to airport

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.490 
airport and between airport to airport
if<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.449> have<00:04:00.540> anything<00:04:01.019> because<00:04:01.319> you're

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
if you have anything because you're

andre not work correctly you don't have

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.680 
andre not work correctly you don't have
any<00:04:03.599> more<00:04:03.780> gasoline<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:06.150> stay<00:04:06.389> there<00:04:06.660> and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
any more gasoline you you stay there and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.900 
any more gasoline you you stay there and
say<00:04:07.019> I<00:04:07.199> need<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.769> go<00:04:07.949> away<00:04:08.190> I'm<00:04:08.489> going<00:04:08.699> to<00:04:08.819> go
