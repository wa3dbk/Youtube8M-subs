happen I mean that's

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.910 
happen I mean that's
sixty-four-thousand-dollar<00:03:22.379> question<00:03:22.410> I

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
sixty-four-thousand-dollar question I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.199 
sixty-four-thousand-dollar question I
think<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.129> people<00:03:23.160> knew<00:03:23.519> exactly<00:03:23.910> how<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
think if people knew exactly how to

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.280 
think if people knew exactly how to
prepare<00:03:24.510> their<00:03:24.660> minds<00:03:24.840> for<00:03:25.110> all<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
prepare their minds for all the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.770 
prepare their minds for all the
tournaments<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.739> they<00:03:25.829> wouldn't<00:03:26.040> lose<00:03:26.220> but

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
tournaments and they wouldn't lose but

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.729 
tournaments and they wouldn't lose but
there's<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.930> ways<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.200> mitigate<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.650> like

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
there's just ways to mitigate it like

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.210 
there's just ways to mitigate it like
making<00:03:29.010> sure<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.459> are<00:03:30.000> calm<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:31.220> at

and<00:03:49.950> we're<00:03:50.040> all<00:03:50.099> I<00:03:50.129> think<00:03:50.430> might<00:03:50.670> have<00:03:50.760> been

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
and we're all I think might have been

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.869 
and we're all I think might have been
partly<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.239> everyone's<00:03:51.660> tired<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:53.519> little

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
partly because everyone's tired a little

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.630 
partly because everyone's tired a little
bit<00:03:54.120> wary<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.720> storm<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.459> yeah<00:03:56.459> they're

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
bit wary of the storm but yeah they're

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.979 
bit wary of the storm but yeah they're
good<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:57.000> wouldn't<00:03:57.299> say<00:03:57.359> that<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.780> helped<00:03:57.930> me

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
good I wouldn't say that I helped me

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.580 
good I wouldn't say that I helped me
compete<00:03:58.290> because<00:03:58.910> if<00:03:59.910> anything<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:01.349> best

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
compete because if anything the best

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.170 
compete because if anything the best
place<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.010> play<00:04:02.160> starcraft<00:04:02.639> is<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.970> dark

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
place to play starcraft is in a dark

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.080 
place to play starcraft is in a dark
room<00:04:03.239> by<00:04:03.540> yourself<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.639> not<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.849> say<00:04:06.000> that

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
room by yourself so it's not to say that

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.720 
room by yourself so it's not to say that
they<00:04:06.180> did<00:04:06.389> help<00:04:07.380> or<00:04:07.650> hurt<00:04:07.859> my<00:04:08.069> performance<00:04:08.549> but

they did help or hurt my performance but

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.120 
they did help or hurt my performance but
that<00:04:08.940> wouldn't<00:04:09.530> attribute<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.680> special

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
that wouldn't attribute a special

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.759 
that wouldn't attribute a special
performance<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.880> them<00:04:12.030> what<00:04:12.750> seems<00:04:12.989> like<00:04:13.230> TVG
