00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello to all today a short 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.259
 video to introduce you to one of 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.879
 new features that will make it sound 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.320
 appearance at version 9.5 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.059
 I want to talk here about missions 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.920
 individual then you will tell me 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.880
 as his individual issue and well 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.529
 it's simply a series 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.119
 of objectives to achieve in each 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.710
 tank class ie it is 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.910
 the light tanks the medium tanks the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.170
 heavy tanks the chasseurs de charroux 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.550
 the artillery once you'll 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.939
 completed all the steps in each of 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.230
 these classes 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.910
 you can unlock four vehicles 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.130
 which will then appear in your garage 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.480
 ready to be played then the four 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.940
 vehicles in question are first of all 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.399
 the stock 4 then the tea 28 gigs the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.590
 tea 55 ha and finally the object of 160 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.149
 so we have a two thirds tank 5 h art of 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.800
 shots this auction of shots 9 and richard 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.390
 firing 10 to win simply by 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.590
 fulfilling objectives 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.420
 the first thing to note is that you 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.500
 will not be able to get the second quarter 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.520
 time you will not get the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.719
 first is that you will not be able 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.489
 get the third time 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.440
 would not have got the 2nd etc etc 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.180
 it's a progressive unlock the csars 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.500
 once being unlocked allows the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.239
 beginning of the mission by leading to 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.800
 next tanks you will have access to these 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.449
 individual missions in the game in 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.520
 going into the tab or currently getting 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.200
 also find the different small 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.580
 ongoing assignments like for example the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.590
 weekend missions where the broadcast of the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.000
 week you will have the coast and 17 of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.800
 tabs of traditional missions 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 a campaign tab that will allow you to 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.830
 see the four tanks that you can 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.660
 try to get when you arrive 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.890
 on the campaign tab you can 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.200
 notice the four silhouettes of 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.300
 tanks unlocked the only the first 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.100
 being currently available for 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.600
 do the show down you have five 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.790
 locations that will indicate the steps 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.170
 that you currently have active and 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.520
 so what you need to know for everyone 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.930
 the sharks you can get through the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.280
 individual missions is that for 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.570
 each one of them fifteen 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.340
 assignments in each class 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.660
 fifteen missions for light tanks 15 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.400
 missions for mediums 15 missions 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.050
 for the heavy ones etc etc then everything 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.940
 you simply have to complete the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.980
 fifteen missions in four of the five 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.570
 categories to unlock the tank at 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.790
 every time you complete the 15th 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.080
 mission of a lot for example if you 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.400
 do the fifteen missions of the tanks 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.560
 light when you accomplish the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.330
 last you will get four tokens 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.190
 5 if you succeed in doing the mission 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.900
 primary secondary mission of the 15th 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.150
 step to unlock a tank thanks to 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.710
 steps you will need 20 chips 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.210
 so how do you hold your chips 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.349
 it's simple you get 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.179
 tokens every time you do the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.470
 15th step of each category for 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.640
 a tank for example if you do the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.410
 15th stage of the light tanks 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.690
 you will unlock four tokens if you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.940
 pass the conditions 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 primary and an extra chips if 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.520
 you pass the conditions 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.080
 secondary as it takes 20 tokens for 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.150
 a tank the calculation is quickly done either 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.710
 you do the five classes of tank 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.450
 that is to say either you do the 15th 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.130
 mission for artillery the mediums 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.600
 cities and garlic and hunters 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.860
 tanks without doing the goals 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.260
 in which case it will make you 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.030
 four tokens x 5 20 tokens you 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.990
 to unlock the tank either 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.250
 you 're missing out on one of 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.940
 categories for example I do not know 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.990
 you do not want to do 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.730
 the artillery you do not want to 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.930
 do 15 artillery missions in this 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.040
 case you do the other four 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.170
 classes ie light tanks 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.700
 the medium tanks the heavy tanks and the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.290
 tank destroyers but against you 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.300
 for each of these four places 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.710
 of tanks during the last mission the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.270
 mission number 15 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.320
 succeed in doing not only the goal 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.950
 primary but also the goal 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.020
 secondary 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.850
 to summarize either you do the five 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.080
 categories trying to have that the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.790
 primary goals be you do 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.020
 four categories but trying 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.670
 to have primary goals and 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.380
 secondary on the 15th stage 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.700
 so how does it work? 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.140
 it's just simple 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.240
 choose the mission that wanted to do 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.410
 so for example if you are if you 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.210
 have not started the tanks yet 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.800
 light ben you choose the mission 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.950
 number one and light tanks right 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.360
 appears the victory conditions so 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.650
 for example for light tanks the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.450
 first mission when you are on the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.040
 stock 4 the primary conditions it's 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.330
 win the battle and be in the ten 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.560
 best players on your team 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.150
 the secondary condition is 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.500
 survive the battle then you do not 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.720
 can accomplish this mission only on the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.459
 shot tanks 4 at the bottom of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.570
 the tab you can see what you 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.370
 will get if you succeed them 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.480
 awarded conditions a secondary so there 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.040
 for example for mission number one 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.090
 light tanks for the stock 4 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.440
 if you win the battle and you 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.910
 join the top ten players from 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.650
 your team will earn 50000 credit 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.360
 and if in addition in the same battle you 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.010
 survive you will have 25,000 credit of 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.110
 bonus once you have chosen 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.040
 the step you want to do you 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.120
 click on start 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.860
 she will then appear as being 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 activated if you return to the tab 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.350
 previous you will see that it appears 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.000
 now down below 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.100
 silhouettes of the four tanks for example 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.930
 there we can see light tanks number one 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.340
 for the victory also reminding you 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.780
 the characteristics that will have to be done 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.830
 to validate it then what's needed 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.910
 know that you can not validated 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.920
 a mission he had not activated 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.840
 so for example if you if you are 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.519
 at mission 4 or 5 but you activate 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.140
 not mission 4 or 5 etc during a 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.820
 part you reach the goals 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.470
 it will not be validated it must be activated at 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.970
 the hand once it activates and the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.380
 hand in a future part if you 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.460
 pass the conditions they are 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.080
 worth and sheets once you have 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.669
 successful one of the steps for example 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.050
 step number 4 or 5 light tanks 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.940
 it will come back and choose on 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.139
 q father loved reward if you 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.220
 do not get the rewards you 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.110
 can not go to the next show 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.240
 so you have to know that the missions 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.680
 that you will have to fill in the different 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.060
 steps go crescendo 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.099
 they are becoming more difficult 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.509
 the more it goes, the more the numbers are 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.180
 higher than you will be asked to 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.500
 to do will be I would say a challenge 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.720
 so we can take an example by 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.849
 example still for lost 4 the mission 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.650
 heavy tanks the first is to 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.180
 destroy an enemy and make at least 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.800
 1000 points of damage whereas if you 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.990
 look at the 15th 15th of the heavy tanks 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.610
 for lust 4 you will have to make 7000 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.440
 damage by adding up the damage 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.849
 caused received is blocked by your armor 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.259
 as you watch the battle and that 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.949
 you win it so it's already another 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.240
 pair of sleeves 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.919
 to note also that every time you 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.500
 complete one of the number 15 missions 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.389
 you will gain a location of in your 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.620
 barracks and a crew and a member 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.270
 female crew of the fact that 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.650
 twelve when you're done doing 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.090
 all the missions you will have a 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.830
 complete female crew at power 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.360
 put in a big tank you'll notice 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.099
 also on the screen the possibility of 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.090
 select only missions 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.259
 for one of the sharp classes 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.550
 wait if you will only see posted 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.210
 the cellars mission for the medium tank 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.650
 here 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.940
 or so if you want filtered in 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.509
 function of the missions you already have 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.800
 successful 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.810
 the show you currently have 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.810
 started and who are currently 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.889
 available to be successful where the 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.060
 missions for which you do not have 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.620
 still asked for your reward and you 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.060
 can do it you can also cash 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.440
 and the show you have already succeeded in 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.880
 ticking the corresponding box 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.990
 so what you need to know is that these 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.120
 missions even though they may seem 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.440
 easy for stage IV go being of 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.789
 more and more difficult missions on 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.770
 the summer 28 concept will be harder 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.639
 the show is 10 55 ha will be more 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.830
 hard as those of the terrain you 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.719
 concepts et cetera et cetera the show 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.400
 for lives as an object of 160 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.840
 announcing itself as being particularly 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.159
 difficult and only a handful of 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.909
 people on the server will succeed in 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.379
 see the chariot 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.669
 the stock is expected to be retained by 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.050
 pretty much everyone but the more you 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.879
 show fewer people will arrive at 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.199
 unlock tanks then at the level of 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.969
 tanks available you have the stock of 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.699
 this top 4 which will therefore be a hunter of 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.069
 two thirds tanks 5 the tea 28 concept that 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.759
 he is a tank destroyer this 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:24.310
 american the t 55 ha which is a medium 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.379
 German fire 9 is subject to 160 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.270
 who is a heavy 10 Soviet firing 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.460
 for the store 4 if I had to summarize 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.259
 it's just a stock 3 a little 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.389
 less mobile and with the barrel 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.819
 intermediates who is on the stub 3 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.409
 that is to say the 40l 48 the terrain since 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:39.759
 the concept is a tank really very 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.259
 strange as you can see at by 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.990
 compared to its design with a turret 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.880
 that can 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.170
 a good angle of rotation but small 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.430
 batches lots that are pretty weak on the 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.080
 side and armor that is not 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.460
 exceptional he still he's also a 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.800
 little bit clumsy it is a little bit of trouble neither 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.050
 better mobility so to see I know 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.430
 not if it will really be a beast of 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.450
 war or on the contrary a tank that the 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.780
 people will quickly forget in the depths of their 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.780
 garage 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.960
 then you have the t 50 5 to note 55 to 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.430
 to engross a Russian tea 54 but in 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.990
 version a little less well and in the 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.000
 camp in the German camp you will notice 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.350
 that he wears the emblem of la rda 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.800
 since it was in rda that he was 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.940
 in use 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.050
 so it's going to be pretty bad it will make you a 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.640
 tank to train your crews to 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.710
 medium if you do for example the 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.810
 branch of the leopard or the branch of 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.910
 eggs 50 mc or will allow to train 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.290
 your crew in peace and quiet 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.780
 finally the big piece that is the object of 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.790
 160 who is a jubilant clone 7 with a 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.110
 a little more mobile gameplay and a little 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.460
 little less resistant who has a good 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.260
 rate of fire in addition that send 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.000
 beautiful praline is very friendly 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.810
 wargaming and if it a very good idea 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.280
 as regards the missions 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.660
 individual since it will allow 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.340
 to offer content to people who have 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.720
 already went around the game I think by 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.490
 example to all people who have a 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.050
 a good deal of thirds say or those 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.430
 who are tired of random battles 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.200
 and who was looking for something to 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.060
 come back to stay on the game other 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.470
 little precision like this information 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.330
 are taken from the test server we do not know 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.650
 not yet if it's the different 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.510
 final steps that will be 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.950
 necessary to accomplish to obtain the 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.270
 char or if it is not going to be 

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.250
 still a little overhauled before 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.540
 the output during version 9.5 so 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.110
 for the moment, take this information 

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.490
 with tweezers 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.000
 thank you for following me and see you soon for 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.000
 a new video
