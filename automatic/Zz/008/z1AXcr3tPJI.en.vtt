00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.740 
if you guys don't really understand the
top-earning<00:01:41.610> glitch<00:01:41.940> are<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.209> just<00:01:42.479> kind<00:01:42.690> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
top-earning glitch are you just kind of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
top-earning glitch are you just kind of
like<00:01:42.929> too<00:01:43.080> complicated<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.740> understand<00:01:44.160> no

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
like too complicated to understand no

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
like too complicated to understand no
I'll<00:01:44.429> take<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.849> time<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.020> video

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
I'll take the time to do it this video

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960 
I'll take the time to do it this video
is<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> lot<00:01:47.039> more<00:01:47.190> simpler<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.640> everyone

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
is a lot more simpler because everyone

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.460 
is a lot more simpler because everyone
knows<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:48.239> to<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.660> basic<00:01:49.020> night<00:01:49.200> jumps

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
knows how to do like basic night jumps

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.169 
knows how to do like basic night jumps
like<00:01:49.890> shock<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:50.310> dump<00:01:50.459> saving<00:01:50.729> around<00:01:51.000> for

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
like shock and dump saving around for

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.770 
like shock and dump saving around for
like<00:01:51.270> decades<00:01:51.959> and<00:01:52.410> them<00:01:53.360> call<00:01:54.360> duty<00:01:54.509> series

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
like decades and them call duty series

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
like decades and them call duty series
like<00:01:54.959> they've<00:01:55.080> always<00:01:55.319> been<00:01:55.440> around<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.130> yeah

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like they've always been around so yeah

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.770 
like they've always been around so yeah
that's<00:01:56.670> pretty<00:01:56.910> much<00:01:57.000> simpler<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.509> anyone

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that's pretty much simpler for anyone

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
that's pretty much simpler for anyone
