hello there my friends and today I'm
having<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.040> look<00:00:02.159> at<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.520> C<00:00:02.909> scope<00:00:03.440> cs4<00:00:04.940> MX<00:00:07.130> okay

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
having a look at the C scope cs4 MX okay

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.620 
having a look at the C scope cs4 MX okay
so<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> motion<00:00:08.880> detector<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.360> scans

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
so this is a motion detector that scans

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.400 
so this is a motion detector that scans
at<00:00:09.980> 17<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> kilohertz<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.210> comes<00:00:12.540> with<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.809> 2d

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
at 17 a kilohertz it comes with a 2d

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.799 
at 17 a kilohertz it comes with a 2d
head<00:00:13.650> which<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> right<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.630> great

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
head which is a right there the great

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.200 
head which is a right there the great
thing<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.109> these<00:00:16.410> about<00:00:17.130> these<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.550> C

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

scope<00:00:18.449> models<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> heads<00:00:19.740> are

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
scope models is that the heads are

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.109 
scope models is that the heads are
completely<00:00:20.310> interchangeable

a disc discrimination 1 and come down

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.700 
a disc discrimination 1 and come down
here<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.810> tell<00:01:28.140> us<00:01:28.229> obscure<00:01:28.500> on

here it will tell us obscure on

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920 
here it will tell us obscure on
concerning<00:01:29.250> discrimination<00:01:29.939> -<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.780> let's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
concerning discrimination - so let's

thing<00:01:57.240> she's<00:01:57.510> got<00:01:57.630> bits<00:01:57.900> which<00:01:58.140> would

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
thing she's got bits which would

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.130 
thing she's got bits which would
represent<00:01:59.310> rusty<00:02:00.120> old<00:02:00.270> iron<00:02:00.570> nails<00:02:00.870> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
represent rusty old iron nails and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780 
represent rusty old iron nails and
things<00:02:01.230> like<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:01.470> okay<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.580> want<00:02:02.730> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
things like that okay so I just want to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.990 
things like that okay so I just want to
show<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> how<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> works

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.210 

something<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.180> I<00:02:09.710> didn't<00:02:10.710> put<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> there

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
something there I didn't put that there

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.000 
something there I didn't put that there
anyway<00:02:12.030> okay<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.780> moment<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.800> have

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
anyway okay so at the moment we have

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.230 
anyway okay so at the moment we have
discrimination<00:02:15.140> 1<00:02:16.140> &amp;<00:02:16.380> 2<00:02:17.000> completely<00:02:18.000> turned

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
discrimination 1 &amp; 2 completely turned

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.510 
discrimination 1 &amp; 2 completely turned
off<00:02:18.390> alright<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.230> are<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.070> basically

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
off alright so we are we are basically

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.400 
off alright so we are we are basically
working<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.120> an<00:02:21.240> all<00:02:21.390> metal<00:02:21.630> mode<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.110> moment

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
working in an all metal mode the moment

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.700 
working in an all metal mode the moment
side<00:02:22.560> BAM<00:02:22.970> nice<00:02:23.970> strong<00:02:24.300> feet<00:02:24.510> at<00:02:24.930> 50<00:02:25.260> P<00:02:25.470> not

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
side BAM nice strong feet at 50 P not

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.990 
side BAM nice strong feet at 50 P not
strong<00:02:25.950> beat<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> hammered<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:26.820> well

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
strong beat for the hammered as well

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.050 
strong beat for the hammered as well
nice<00:02:27.810> strong<00:02:28.740> bleep<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.850> Roman

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
nice strong bleep for that little Roman

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.330 
nice strong bleep for that little Roman
coin<00:02:30.390> will<00:02:31.140> come<00:02:31.320> over<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.800> horrible<00:02:32.130> iron

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
coin will come over to the horrible iron

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.610 
coin will come over to the horrible iron
mess<00:02:32.700> over<00:02:33.240> here

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
mess over here

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.930 
mess over here
and<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.890> nice<00:02:35.040> strong<00:02:35.370> beat<00:02:35.610> for<00:02:35.820> that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and we have a nice strong beat for that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.370 
and we have a nice strong beat for that
as<00:02:36.030> well<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:36.990> is<00:02:37.170> we'll

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
as well it's like what we do is we'll

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.770 
as well it's like what we do is we'll
turn<00:02:37.650> our<00:02:38.070> discrimination<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.270> first<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.660> up

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
turn our discrimination the first one up

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.310 
turn our discrimination the first one up
to<00:02:39.990> around<00:02:40.770> about<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:42.170> probably<00:02:43.170> are

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
to around about for probably are

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.490 
to around about for probably are
actually<00:02:43.680> about<00:02:44.010> four<00:02:44.630> five<00:02:45.630> for

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
actually about four five for

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.080 
actually about four five for
discrimination<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.250> okay<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.850> where<00:02:48.000> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
discrimination to okay this is where you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.699 
discrimination to okay this is where you
need<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.360> spend<00:02:48.480> some<00:02:48.750> time<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:49.140> your<00:02:49.230> detector

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
need to spend some time of your detector

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.320 
need to spend some time of your detector
so<00:02:50.190> discrimination<00:02:50.850> when<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.030> don't<00:02:51.180> go

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
so discrimination when you don't go

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
so discrimination when you don't go
really<00:02:52.080> want<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> go<00:02:52.440> any<00:02:52.650> further<00:02:52.920> than<00:02:53.160> four

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really want to go any further than four

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.370 
really want to go any further than four
because<00:02:53.760> there's<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.480> lot<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.660> metals<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.320> are

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
because there's a lot of metals that are

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.780 
because there's a lot of metals that are
similar<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.980> each<00:02:56.100> other

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
similar to each other

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.540 
similar to each other
so<00:02:57.330> Hamid's<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.290> come<00:02:58.980> up<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> same

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so Hamid's can come up on the same

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.000 
so Hamid's can come up on the same
scalars<00:03:00.209> as<00:03:00.750> ring<00:03:01.110> pools<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.680> things<00:03:01.890> like

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
scalars as ring pools and things like

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.710 
scalars as ring pools and things like
that<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.400> don't<00:03:02.430> discriminate<00:03:03.030> out<00:03:03.450> too

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
that so you don't discriminate out too

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.300 
that so you don't discriminate out too
much<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.140> four<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.320> your<00:03:04.410> gonna<00:03:04.500> miss<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
much of four is your gonna miss the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.400 
much of four is your gonna miss the
little<00:03:05.489> hammers<00:03:05.940> okay<00:03:06.239> discrimination<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
little hammers okay discrimination to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.020 
little hammers okay discrimination to
for<00:03:07.590> today<00:03:07.860> what<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.550> do<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.850> going

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
for today what we can do is just going

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.180 
for today what we can do is just going
to<00:03:09.090> leave<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.239> around<00:03:09.420> about<00:03:09.900> five<00:03:10.290> right<00:03:10.860> okay

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
to leave it around about five right okay

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.650 
to leave it around about five right okay
here<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.430> go<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.970> what<00:03:12.120> we'll<00:03:12.209> do<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.540> we'll

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
here we go so what we'll do is now we'll

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.199 
here we go so what we'll do is now we'll
come<00:03:12.780> over<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.140> taxi<00:03:13.530> bit<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.830> metal<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
come over to the taxi bit of metal the

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.370 
come over to the taxi bit of metal the
bedspreads<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.989> iron<00:03:16.640> nothing<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:19.050> that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
bedspreads the iron nothing so that's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.870 
bedspreads the iron nothing so that's
how<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> discrimination<00:03:20.070> works<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.730> is

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
how the discrimination works so this is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.310 
how the discrimination works so this is
where<00:03:21.030> things<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> bit<00:03:21.630> more<00:03:21.900> interesting

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
where things get a bit more interesting

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.860 
where things get a bit more interesting
with<00:03:22.680> this<00:03:22.800> particular<00:03:23.420> detector<00:03:24.420> that's<00:03:24.480> a

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
with this particular detector that's a

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.360 
with this particular detector that's a
lot<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.110> time<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.410> my<00:03:25.530> 3mx<00:03:26.010> oh<00:03:26.130> that's<00:03:26.280> a

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
lot of time with my 3mx oh that's a

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.890 
lot of time with my 3mx oh that's a
really<00:03:26.580> really<00:03:26.610> good<00:03:26.760> finds<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.390> but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
really really good finds of that but

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.090 
really really good finds of that but
this<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.440> interesting<00:03:28.590> I'll<00:03:28.920> toast

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
this is this is interesting I'll toast

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.500 
this is this is interesting I'll toast
us<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.340> step<00:03:29.580> up<00:03:29.700> from<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.269> have<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
us to step up from that we have the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.780 
us to step up from that we have the
typical<00:03:30.900> pinpoint<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.530> yeah<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:32.640> have

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
typical pinpoint here yeah so if we have

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.490 
typical pinpoint here yeah so if we have
a<00:03:32.910> target<00:03:33.180> we<00:03:33.510> put<00:03:33.690> pinpoint<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.260> that'll<00:03:34.410> go

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
a target we put pinpoint and that'll go

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.550 
a target we put pinpoint and that'll go
straight<00:03:34.769> over<00:03:34.800> just<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.340> example

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.440 

there<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.620> go<00:03:41.769> okay<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.580> just<00:03:43.060> example

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
there you go okay so just just example

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.910 
there you go okay so just just example
at<00:03:43.510> some<00:03:43.629> pinpoint<00:03:44.050> works<00:03:44.260> obviously<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
at some pinpoint works obviously the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.150 
at some pinpoint works obviously the
detectors<00:03:45.750> some<00:03:46.750> film<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.080> video<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.950> when

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
detectors some film in the video so when

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.770 
detectors some film in the video so when
it's<00:03:48.310> stuck<00:03:48.550> there<00:03:48.610> pinpoint<00:03:49.300> when<00:03:49.660> it's

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
it's stuck there pinpoint when it's

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.490 
it's stuck there pinpoint when it's
stuck<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.140> middle<00:03:50.349> it's<00:03:50.470> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
stuck in the middle it's a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.020 
stuck in the middle it's a
discrimination<00:03:51.040> one<00:03:51.310> okay<00:03:51.550> it's<00:03:51.670> tennis<00:03:51.910> was

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
discrimination one okay it's tennis was

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.960 
discrimination one okay it's tennis was
going<00:03:52.209> on<00:03:52.330> concern<00:03:52.599> of<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.519> we<00:03:54.519> have<00:03:54.670> further

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
going on concern of this we have further

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.180 
going on concern of this we have further
discrimination<00:03:55.390> options<00:03:56.110> with<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.860> when<00:03:57.099> we

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
discrimination options with this when we

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.160 
discrimination options with this when we
pull<00:03:57.400> down<00:03:57.549> here<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.599> will<00:03:58.900> tell<00:03:59.140> us

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
pull down here and that will tell us

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.350 
pull down here and that will tell us
what's<00:03:59.410> going<00:03:59.560> on<00:03:59.739> concerning<00:04:00.280> this<00:04:00.519> as<00:04:01.120> well

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
asking it questions about beeps in our

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.270 
asking it questions about beeps in our
feedback<00:04:07.690> as<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.140> what<00:04:08.230> what<00:04:08.680> may<00:04:08.860> be<00:04:08.920> below

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
feedback as to what what may be below

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.710 
feedback as to what what may be below
you<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.790> that's<00:04:10.000> what's<00:04:10.150> interesting<00:04:10.299> me

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
you and that's what's interesting me

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.180 
you and that's what's interesting me
most<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.230> I'm<00:04:11.650> really<00:04:11.829> really<00:04:11.920> looking

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
most and I'm really really looking

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.650 
most and I'm really really looking
forward<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.610> spending<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.970> bit<00:04:13.120> more<00:04:13.150> time<00:04:13.299> with

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
forward to spending a bit more time with

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.600 
forward to spending a bit more time with
this<00:04:13.780> at<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:14.049> detector<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.010> getting<00:04:15.250> into<00:04:15.459> how

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
this at a detector and getting into how

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.300 
this at a detector and getting into how
these<00:04:15.790> all<00:04:16.090> work<00:04:16.900> together<00:04:17.169> but<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.829> me<00:04:17.950> so<00:04:18.130> far

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
these all work together but to me so far

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.370 
these all work together but to me so far
looks<00:04:18.609> are<00:04:18.760> really<00:04:19.000> really<00:04:19.209> powerful<00:04:19.419> which

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
looks are really really powerful which

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.080 
looks are really really powerful which
is<00:04:20.470> really<00:04:20.680> obvious<00:04:20.950> because<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.190> detects<00:04:21.940> are

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
is really obvious because it detects are

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.400 
is really obvious because it detects are
normally<00:04:22.510> very<00:04:22.600> very<00:04:22.930> good<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.139> keeping

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
normally very very good to keeping

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:42.560 
normally very very good to keeping
things<00:04:23.650> simple<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.610> keeping<00:04:25.450> their<00:04:25.870> power

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.270 

because<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.900> camera<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:45.360> let's<00:04:46.360> try

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
because it's on camera but let's try

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.100 
because it's on camera but let's try
let's<00:04:48.280> try<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:49.260> okay<00:04:50.289> 50p<00:04:53.610> try<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:55.080> yay

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
be ten or twelve inches now let's try to

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.779 
be ten or twelve inches now let's try to
pinpoint<00:05:03.160> her
