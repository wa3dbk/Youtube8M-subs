 thank you because they asked me to 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.180
 I did this tutorial of this this 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.610
 makeup that would upload to facebook and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.939
 instagram and they asked me to please be 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.830
 I made them is a reproduction no more or 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.580
 less try to do what Aurora did 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.320
 you know that in this and follow it and 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.379
 Well I hope you like it is very 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.879
 simple so we started that 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.760
 girls first I will use a 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.890
 prebase of shadows and I will use as 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.890
 base a concealer and with this brush 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.119
 then I will use a palette of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.409
 shades of the brand by fibers and I'm going 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.750
 to leave the list where they can 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:16.630
 find is number 35 w 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.880
 I'm going to use a bone color 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.880
 and I'm going to apply it in this part of the eye 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.670
 Well, I'm going to use another hair brush 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.290
 very soft and I will use a 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 shade in hue like orange more or less 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.009
 this and instead of starting from here 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.009
 I'm going to start here 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.890
 I'm going to blur everything very well 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.619
 then I will have to take another shadow 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.489
 in darker brown a little more 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.630
 dark and I'll put it in this part of 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.250
 here to give some intensity 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.490
 blurring very well I'm going to join the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.490
 two 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.950
 this is a recreation of the last 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.950
 tutorial that rose aurora good now what 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.870
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.709
 Bandit is dirty because I used it in 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.720
 the other eye if they do not have tape like 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.470
 it says in mexico tape your ex or o tape 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.960
 they can use a bandit like this pencil 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 black color 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.140
 and I'm going to draw a line does not have to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.200
 be perfect because right now what 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.150
 I want it now, we are going to blur it 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.150
 but if I want it to be thick 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.480
 I'm going to use it to blur 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.480
 what we already have now 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.819
 as from the inside out 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.020
 to make it a little wider 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.819
 As I tell you, it does not have to be perfect 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.819
 it will not be perfect 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.390
 can clean with the brush 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.390
 corrector more or less like this 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.830
 and I'm going to use a brown color 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.930
 and a little bit darker 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.580
 than the one I 've already used in this case 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.850
 I will use the same palette I will 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.100
 use this nothing else very little I'm going to 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.250
 use and I'll put in this part of 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.250
 here 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.319
 well more or less 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.479
 with the band 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.390
 you can see here how it was from 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.240
 night gas 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.940
 if you do not know it follow the instagram and 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.930
 took out some that are these are the great great 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.820
 of love are the most dramatic and I 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.920
 I have used many times the truth is 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.470
 that I take care of them a lot and you can 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.780
 reuse several and several times always 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.110
 and when you clean them then clean with 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.110
 alcohol 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.170
 under the eye I'm going to use a color 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.820
 purple this is another ivory palette 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:28.200
 Brazil is 35w and I will use these 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.200
 two colors that are here 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.170
 the mascara I'm going to use 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.170
 this 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.470
 as you can see this is the 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.200
 final result and the tabs give you 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.850
 a great view and it's very simple 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.040
 there really are very few steps that 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.840
 have to do I hope you like it 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.400
