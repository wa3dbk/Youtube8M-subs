00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:10.740
 Hello everyone, this is again max blinded 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.660
 one new thing is a toy like that. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.550
 Well, what happened to take three LEDs 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.340
 which turns the priest 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:29.099
 their here is this little motor 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 small size twists so here 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 this little motor 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.100
 twists this whole structure like this but 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.940
 work very interesting here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:45.020
 bearings stand under the seeds interesting 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:49.829
 so went the body a piece of syringe snapped 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 2 bronze brushes from you two bronze 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.590
 Iâ€™ll show you a little ring now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.789
 action how it all works here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.809
 control transformer diode bridge and 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 two transistors and 2 variables 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.380
 there are fewer resistors 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.400
 rotational speed will be set now 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.400
 let's see what happened 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.239
 In general, it turned out like this . 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:22.650
 blinded everything on a quick hand that is how 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.130
 there is so well, who did not like 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:32.900
 I will say one thing, do nothing better 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.900
 I will not speak happily anymore
