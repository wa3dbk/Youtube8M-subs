00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
another model for you guys this one this

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.290 
another model for you guys this one this
time<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> Gemini<00:00:09.260> 200<00:00:10.280> American<00:00:11.280> Eagle<00:00:11.580> ERJ

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
time is a Gemini 200 American Eagle ERJ

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.470 
time is a Gemini 200 American Eagle ERJ
145<00:00:14.719> made<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:15.900> Gemini<00:00:16.289> Jets<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.850> as<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.420> said

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
145 made by Gemini Jets and as I said

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.769 
145 made by Gemini Jets and as I said
it's<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> scale<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.859> hundred<00:00:20.779> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it's in the scale want to do hundred and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.019 
it's in the scale want to do hundred and
so<00:00:22.020> let's<00:00:22.230> start<00:00:22.320> off<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:22.800> key<00:00:22.980> box<00:00:23.160> you've

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so let's start off with key box you've

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.050 
so let's start off with key box you've
got<00:00:24.240> American<00:00:24.600> Airlines<00:00:25.080> which<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:26.000> kind<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
got American Airlines which is kind of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
got American Airlines which is kind of
odd<00:00:27.180> since<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.990> American<00:00:28.380> Eagle<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
odd since it's American Eagle but I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.519 
odd since it's American Eagle but I
understand<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.150> American<00:00:31.050> Eagle<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
understand because American Eagle is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.040 
understand because American Eagle is
American<00:00:32.130> Airlines<00:00:32.430> subsidary<00:00:33.050> which

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
American Airlines subsidary which

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.600 
American Airlines subsidary which
basically<00:00:34.500> means<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.040> their<00:00:35.219> regional

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
basically means it's their regional

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.709 
basically means it's their regional
carrier<00:00:36.230> they're<00:00:37.230> smaller<00:00:37.649> carrier<00:00:38.129> airline

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
carrier they're smaller carrier airline

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.510 
carrier they're smaller carrier airline
so<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.200> American<00:00:40.739> doesn't<00:00:40.980> want<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> fly<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
so if American doesn't want to fly to a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
so if American doesn't want to fly to a
location<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.210> say<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.200> don't<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.469> Little

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
location like say I don't know Little

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.970 
location like say I don't know Little
Rock<00:00:44.040> Arkansas<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.969> someplace<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.980> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
Rock Arkansas or someplace like that but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
Rock Arkansas or someplace like that but
they<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.250> their<00:00:47.550> regional<00:00:48.239> carrier<00:00:48.750> like

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
they want their regional carrier like

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.650 
they want their regional carrier like
they<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> plane<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.030> small<00:00:51.420> enough

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
they want a plane that's small enough

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
they want a plane that's small enough
but<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.800> still<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.550> then

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
but they still want to be there then

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.250 
but they still want to be there then
they<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:54.090> maybe<00:00:54.360> their<00:00:54.570> regional<00:00:54.930> carrier

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
they use maybe their regional carrier

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.330 
they use maybe their regional carrier
but<00:00:55.800> anyway<00:00:56.129> enough<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.640> um<00:00:58.340> here's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
but anyway enough with that um here's

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
as I really need one video that will get

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.900 
as I really need one video that will get
a<00:05:07.380> lot<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.830> these<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.850> um<00:05:09.419> one<00:05:10.200> thing<00:05:10.789> it's<00:05:11.789> not

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
a lot of these so um one thing it's not

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.690 
a lot of these so um one thing it's not
really<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.150> old<00:05:12.300> but<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:13.530> front<00:05:13.830> door<00:05:13.919> here

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
really that old but the front door here

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.240 
really that old but the front door here
is<00:05:14.850> on<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.240> side<00:05:15.539> front<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.440> that<00:05:16.620> sides<00:05:16.890> over

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
is on that side front on that sides over

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.469 
is on that side front on that sides over
there<00:05:17.750> but<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.050> anyway<00:05:19.470> if<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.430> would<00:05:20.640> even<00:05:21.000> find

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
there but so anyway if I would even find

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.740 
there but so anyway if I would even find
the<00:05:21.630> proof<00:05:22.010> under<00:05:23.010> $100<00:05:23.729> it's<00:05:24.270> definitely<00:05:24.720> a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
the proof under $100 it's definitely a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.290 
the proof under $100 it's definitely a
must<00:05:25.140> buy<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.919> this<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:26.700> really<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.060> first

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
must buy and this is really the first

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.719 
must buy and this is really the first
model<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.720> I've<00:05:27.810> said<00:05:27.990> is<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.140> must<00:05:28.470> but<00:05:28.729> I'm

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
model that I've said is a must but I'm

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.090 
model that I've said is a must but I'm
really<00:05:29.910> looking<00:05:30.270> forward<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.600> other<00:05:31.100> Gemini
