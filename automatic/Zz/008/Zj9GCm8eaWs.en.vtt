00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.860
 oh do not think I can not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.850
 hear moan behind your screen 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 homogeneous one can pokémon or why not 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.820
 it's not supposed to be great after all 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.840
 those years I spent in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 completely ignored the hen with eggs 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.789
 of gold I was ashamed of nintendo was 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.350
 maybe an error 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.820
 this is never played a game 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.260
 pokemon certainly that one out of his 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.760
 appearance I was already too old for 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.869
 see there any interest observe 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.279
 this as a kind of phenomena 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 elusive that touched everything 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.500
 was younger than me 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.239
 and anyway I was way too much 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.800
 busy entertaining me with more games 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.870
 designed for people kills me up from my 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.620
 age as good opportunity hollwyood tanguay 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.000
 kong 64 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.140
 that's why I consider pokemon 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.760
 as the guarantor of a generational gap 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.110
 a kind of game that sets the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 generation of players appeared after the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 mine is never stingy purse 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.590
 attempts to bring me out the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.920
 weight of years and which weighs on my 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 shoulders 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 given my total ignorance in the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.520
 matter I did five minutes of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 searches before writing this 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.280
 chronicle I found that the series 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.809
 pokemon had been inspired by the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.219
 collection of insects your camp there 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.750
 let's think carefully if we take into account 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.190
 the fact that zelda was inspired by the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 discovery of a cave in a forest 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.860
 we can conclude that nintendo is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 past master in the way of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.500
 turn gold mine all that and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.760
 many others have helped destroy 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.189
 by industrialization and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.750
 the galloping urbanization of Japan nili 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.040
 I may be too old for 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.450
 pokemon but I really have trouble 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.130
 understand the central concept that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 govern this universe because between do 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.920
 fight wild creatures that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.659
 are caught in balls unwittingly 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.100
 and achieve a better world 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.720
 it seems to me that an essential step 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.189
 missing on the call and it's not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 really in this pokemon x that I could 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.110
 fill this gap where we embody a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.549
 boy I called from the tale no no 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.990
 no no no said nintendo the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.159
 line interactions no longer allow for 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 put such blasphemy ten children 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.689
 may need to be shocked clothes 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 by seth henry wheat resi a good so 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.229
 knot head unheard 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.250
 briefly him and four other characters 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.270
 Tasteless side effects are going to have 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.619
 work for free for a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.000
 researcher wishing to discover the secret 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.369
 hidden behind the mega evolution 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.270
 pokemon and then en route I 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.799
 do not suddenly know it was necessary 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 recover badges then a group of 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.350
 bad guys wanted to destroy the pokemon to 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.579
 using a millenary machine then 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 suddenly the ultimate dream of head of 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.460
 we was to become pokemon champion 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.719
 but I guess I have not been 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.159
 attentive enough to understand the 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.570
 nick links that unite these goals 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.040
 to each other another aspect that has 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.630
 withstood my logic is why the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.930
 professor called on four other 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.399
 children 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.899
 three of them would not have a damn 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.039
 throughout the adventurous the fourth 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.760
 was especially there to remind what 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.230
 knot head point was special 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.400
 big he did the whole thing alone l 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 adventure could very well have happened 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.060
 on the other four no more at the end 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.720
 he was on stage with him band of 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.129
 profiteers 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.689
 another thing that violently violated me 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.549
 struck by discovering this universe and that 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.780
 the sentence is pokemon can 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.040
 virtually summarize everything that 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.329
 pass I understand they have a 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.900
 central place but there is nothing 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.190
 else 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.780
 people are either pokemon trainers 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.129
 which most victims city ​​on the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.599
 roads between villages eyes fixed 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.040
 towards the infinite waiting to accomplish their 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.599
 destiny that is to fight against me 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.579
 before staying nailed there for eternity 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.040
 to wait for death either people who 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.480
 speak of pokemon even my own mother has 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.769
 been particularly happy with me 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.489
 flank out of the house when she 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.019
 learned that I was going to work 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.000
 free for a student teacher 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.680
 the pokemon there is nothing but 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.030
 pokémon apart from a central 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.889
 electric that provides energy to the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.090
 pokemon ball factory I found it 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.829
 there was a lack of depth in 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.329
 the universe proposed by pokemon x to which 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.859
 I did not expect but maybe 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.090
 am I missing next because once 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.920
 I understood that the structure was 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.190
 constantly the same to know how to take the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.810
 road 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.489
 arrived a village realize that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.599
 the road from after closed solve some 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.129
 thing in the village doing some 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.489
 pokemon fights can the road is 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.440
 clear 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.340
 repeat the thing and that local people 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.599
 very rarely something 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.859
 interesting to say I stopped 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.810
 naturally to wear them a 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.859
 any attention but complain about 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 these aspects seem somewhat 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.889
 moved since the apparent purpose of the game 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.599
 is to find excuses to follow 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.250
 pokemon battles so let's talk about 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.419
 fighting at the beginning we choose a pokemon 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.500
 basic I took a kind of 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.910
 blue frog that appeared 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.109
 nice and then you have to climb 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.489
 a pokemon team that we capture 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.000
 in balls through the different 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.620
 areas of the game 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.819
 I guess the attraction of capturing 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.329
 as much as possible and get them up 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.790
 in level 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.699
 now here is my problem all this 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.810
 is totally useless why because 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.340
 that if he does like me and that one 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.870
 keep his pokemon choke from the beginning 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.010
 as main pokemon he will go up 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.900
 high level as not possible and 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.609
 become completely abused after two 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.750
 hours of play I swear I was doing 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.699
 constantly fights against 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.500
 pokemon and indoor at least 10 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.549
 levels to my frog in such a case 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.260
 the fights are entirely without 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.669
 of interest since it is too easy and I 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.659
 am found at spa but the button at the 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.400
 most of the time to try 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.049
 to gain a little and even during 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.709
 rare times that it did not work 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.299
 not serious 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.379
 all my other pokemon having benefited from 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.430
 my frog to ride high level 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.930
 in their corner he was perfectly 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 able to pass the fights of the same 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.019
 way I joined then the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.879
 next pokemon center for all 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.560
 resuscitate for free I lost two 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.669
 fighting the whole game once in a 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.959
 hell of caves a little 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.820
 labyrinthine filled with encounters 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.739
 mandatory random tests I test them 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.030
 random encounters in passing ours 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.469
 were in the final five fights 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.580
 oh my god gentleman exclaimed same 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:24.940
 will I suddenly have to take 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.550
 all 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.870
 combat system ah not false alarm 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.890
 the second attempt with attacks 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.810
 random worked well 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.160
 if the ultimate goal of pokemon x was to 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.330
 instill the basics of his system of 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.680
 particularly rich fight for 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.810
 then go fight online with 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.670
 others in this case the game nearly failed to 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.200
 execrable way to his duty 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.090
 because I stepped on the game like a 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.270
 bulldozer thanks to the power of the button 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.550
 at 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.660
 I spent 22 hours on pokemon x and 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.340
 I have rarely had such a weak 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.900
 feeling of accomplishment in ending 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.400
 a game so I guess I'm 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.140
 totally missed out on everything 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.610
 makes the game exceptional but at risk 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.960
 to ridicule me to boy fans 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.100
 who must certainly already take me 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.970
 for a terrorist I'm still 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.680
 ask the question 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.720
 not in a haughty and sarcastic way 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.430
 but for the sake of showing off the aspect 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.840
 nostalgic of the equation that is what 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.090
 is supposed to be great in this 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.040
 pokemon and x not our pokemon in general 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.690
 in pokemon and x because apart from 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.370
 the design of some pokémons I did not 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.210
 seen nothing I put good for example the 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.160
 mouth of my frog 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.360
 but some other I mean one 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.190
 among them is a keyring 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.290
 with eyes at this level there too 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.610
 I can imagine pokémon it does not me 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.080
 remains more than from the premise that 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.940
 this pokemon x and the ugly duckling
