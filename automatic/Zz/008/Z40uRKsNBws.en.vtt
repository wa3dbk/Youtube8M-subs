00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.800
 You are a beautiful girl but you are missing 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.840
 a lot of work your body is missing a lot 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.920
 attention when I decided to participate ever 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.380
 I figured I was going to become miss 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.820
 universe but what I did say was 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.860
 I feel ready and ready to be there 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.099
 I do not feel that you need much 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.720
 work like this have you presented three times already 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.880
 at home between and why do you think you 've 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.699
 I stayed because I was missing a lot 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.130
 preparation wants what time to spend the 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.409
 hemibody then I think if 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.750
 you decided to stop modeling because you did not 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:36.220
 you feel physically well my question is 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.220
 what do we do here with you today 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.370
 therefore it is necessary to be 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.240
 physically better to see if what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.310
 you are a lot of everything 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.270
 and that when a woman is on high 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.400
 can make us look rough in the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.670
 what we are looking for is femininity 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.460
 the delicacy the softness the harmony 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.470
 you also need to work very hard 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.240
 you have a divine stature for me 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.910
 you have many conditions me to me 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.100
 I really like your face again I see you 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.100
 elegant I think if I put a dress on you 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 and if he taught you how to walk well, what are you going 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 make incredible you have that then 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.430
 yes yes I will get to stop there to ask 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.020
 the work of my universe 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.780
 I have to bring the qualities to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.760
 make my universe 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.030
 I think you have a very favorable figure 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.390
 your height also helps a lot 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.780
 cool big longer step that's 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.280
 more strength plus strength a bigger one in 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.280
 looks from the bottom lifts the face 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.530
 but no 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.710
 much better is a big difference 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 when we give a sense to the step that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.820
 we are giving but the goal is 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.400
 final race of this contest is to win 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.500
 miss universe you think you have the 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.820
 emotional physical conditions for 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.060
 take for so much 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.100
 the task recognition job and you think 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.679
 you can do I think that if I 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.840
 like challenges a woman of challenges not 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.060
 I like to be doing nothing with you 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.459
 I'm studying working and if I have 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.720

 lupita jose I do not know what he has but to me 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.560
 the personal does not allow me to see myself 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.540
 I feel that it must be more transparent 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 I would like to propose that you havana 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.240

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.400
 because I know that I did not want something like that 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.010

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.070
 or you do not have the economy then some friends 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.020
