finesse<00:04:05.730> worm<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:06.990> see<00:04:07.170> here<00:04:07.440> we're

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
finesse worm so you can see here we're

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.540 
finesse worm so you can see here we're
pretty<00:04:08.490> well<00:04:08.700> on<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> drop<00:04:09.210> shot<00:04:10.070> or<00:04:11.070> even<00:04:11.400> as<00:04:11.520> a

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
pretty well on a drop shot or even as a

trailer<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.090> you're<00:04:12.240> using<00:04:13.370> something<00:04:14.370> small

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
trailer if you're using something small

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.790 
trailer if you're using something small
like<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.330> small<00:04:15.840> swim<00:04:16.110> jig<00:04:16.320> or<00:04:16.410> something<00:04:16.710> like

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:16.800 
like a small swim jig or something like

a<00:04:16.830> finesse<00:04:17.160> one<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.610> would<00:04:17.730> actually<00:04:17.820> be

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
a finesse one this would actually be

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.820 
a finesse one this would actually be
pretty<00:04:18.120> cool<00:04:18.390> because<00:04:18.480> it<00:04:18.660> has<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> curly<00:04:19.800> tail

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
pretty cool because it has a curly tail

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.000 
pretty cool because it has a curly tail
on<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.220> end<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.870> it's<00:04:21.870> just<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.170> small<00:04:22.710> finesse

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
on the end and it's just a small finesse

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.230 
on the end and it's just a small finesse
lower<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.520> why<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.670> probably<00:04:23.880> throw<00:04:24.060> this

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
lower this is why I probably throw this

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.690 
lower this is why I probably throw this
late<00:04:25.200> fall<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.770> water<00:04:25.950> gets<00:04:26.190> cold<00:04:26.280> and

the<00:04:27.060> bass<00:04:27.240> are<00:04:27.450> really<00:04:27.690> finicky<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.230> drop

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
the bass are really finicky on a drop

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.510 
the bass are really finicky on a drop

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
small little finesse worm with kind of a

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.250 
small little finesse worm with kind of a
bigger<00:04:47.760> than<00:04:48.000> average<00:04:48.150> tail<00:04:48.720> on<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.170> it's

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
bigger than average tail on it and it's

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.980 
bigger than average tail on it and it's
cupped<00:04:49.590> which<00:04:50.310> what<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.420> do<00:04:51.510> in<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:51.780> I

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
cupped which what you can do in this I

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.360 
cupped which what you can do in this I
think<00:04:52.050> this<00:04:52.260> one<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.440> made<00:04:53.100> for<00:04:53.370> drop<00:04:53.640> shot<00:04:54.350> and

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
think this one is made for drop shot and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.490 
think this one is made for drop shot and
with<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.550> cupped<00:04:56.850> tail<00:04:57.690> like<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.140> is<00:04:58.290> as<00:04:58.470> you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
with the cupped tail like it is as you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.950 
with the cupped tail like it is as you
guys<00:04:58.740> can<00:04:58.890> see<00:04:59.000> water<00:05:00.000> kind<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.420> gets<00:05:00.600> up<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.870> it

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
guys can see water kind of gets up in it

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.180 
guys can see water kind of gets up in it
and<00:05:01.050> forms<00:05:01.290> a<00:05:01.350> little<00:05:01.590> bubble<00:05:01.920> which<00:05:02.010> will

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
and forms a little bubble which will

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.880 
and forms a little bubble which will
keep<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:03.150> floating<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.290> little<00:05:04.620> bit<00:05:04.740> better

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
keep this floating a little bit better

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.530 
keep this floating a little bit better
so<00:05:05.190> it's<00:05:05.310> not<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:05.760> your<00:05:05.910> drop<00:05:06.090> shots<00:05:06.330> not

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
so it's not so your drop shots not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.880 
so it's not so your drop shots not
looking<00:05:06.780> like<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.050> it's<00:05:07.260> looking<00:05:07.590> more<00:05:07.710> like

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
looking like this it's looking more like

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.580 
looking like this it's looking more like
this<00:05:08.100> more<00:05:08.340> natural<00:05:08.880> more<00:05:09.050> like<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.080> bait<00:05:10.320> fish

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
this more natural more like a bait fish

this more natural more like a bait fish

that<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.710> course<00:05:14.040> comes<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.340> an<00:05:14.400> awesome

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
that and of course comes in an awesome

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.690 
that and of course comes in an awesome
color<00:05:15.000> on<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.870> can't<00:05:16.050> be<00:05:16.400> creating<00:05:17.400> pumpkin

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
color on you can't be creating pumpkin

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.310 
color on you can't be creating pumpkin
or<00:05:17.820> watermelon<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.390> think<00:05:18.660> one<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:18.900> these<00:05:19.050> or

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
or watermelon I think one of these or

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.430 
or watermelon I think one of these or
two<00:05:19.440> at<00:05:19.560> ease<00:05:19.650> with<00:05:19.740> watermelon<00:05:20.250> red<00:05:21.350> so<00:05:22.350> you

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
two at ease with watermelon red so you

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.840 
two at ease with watermelon red so you
can<00:05:22.530> see<00:05:22.680> there<00:05:22.890> came<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.580> two<00:05:23.670> different

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
can see there came in two different

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.430 
can see there came in two different
colors<00:05:24.180> which<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.420> pretty<00:05:24.570> cool<00:05:24.780> those<00:05:24.990> are<00:05:25.110> my

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
colors which is pretty cool those are my

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.800 
colors which is pretty cool those are my
two<00:05:25.500> go<00:05:25.800> two<00:05:25.860> colors<00:05:26.370> if<00:05:26.550> it's<00:05:27.060> in<00:05:27.240> somewhat

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
two go two colors if it's in somewhat

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.720 
two go two colors if it's in somewhat
clear<00:05:28.050> water<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.530> clear<00:05:28.770> water<00:05:28.980> that<00:05:29.520> will<00:05:29.640> be

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
clear water to clear water that will be

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.100 
clear water to clear water that will be
the<00:05:29.850> color<00:05:30.030> off<00:05:30.180> throw<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:30.570> if<00:05:30.630> it's<00:05:30.750> dirty<00:05:30.930> up

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110
