00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello this week can do it again 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.529
 go unhealthy and that's why 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.790
 I have delicious reporters lemons 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.190
 groupies made on site 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.769
 I have the recipe in the American 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 found room and then have the 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 American units the german 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 translated a bit with the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 recipe played sugar content some 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.619
 was way too high is still high 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 but okay a bit reduced and that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.170
 the end result but really his came 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.170
 they have become very fluid and there 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.820
 is still on top with glaze on top 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.570
 just irresistible but I would 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.469
 say Schalke gang before the video and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.360
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:49.170
 and what about next 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.270
 video again for this summery 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.230
 we need two untreated cookies 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.829
 lemon 150 grams Italian record 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.449
 cheese an ice cream much sugar the exact one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.400
 I will write you quantities again 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.330
 Put some butter in the list and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.010
 if necessary, food coloring 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.010
 baking soda and salt 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.600
 icing sugar for the glaze on top and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 Of course, more I use about 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 300 grams of baking soda and salt 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.050
 it can ever mix to sew 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.900
 and set aside the lemon peel 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.450
 I gently rub it off so that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.550
 White is not present and the juice 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.890
 the lemon press I have out then 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.990
 a portion of juice and peel for the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 dough and a portion for the glaze 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.940
 on top of that, then I start already 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.380
 with the dough I give the room 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.190
 warm butter in a suitable 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.190
 bowl the sugar around it and 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.100
 yet the record of Records gives our 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.560
 cookies a wonderful consistency he 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.479
 makes it very fluffy and very soft 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.500
 then I mix the three ingredients 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.450
 strong with the mixer after a while 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.420
 of the house, I'll give that one then 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.340
 train over that too under and through 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.470
 the yolk gets the dough ever 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.070
 find a really nice yellow tone 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.170
 me the grated lemon peel and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.209
 I then add the juice of a lemon 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.170
 also and so and listen to the whole 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.270
 under 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.099
 if your lemons were very small 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.870
 you can of course also the abrasion of 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.030
 use two lemons 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.410
 it has now happened to me 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.080
 then I take the shots with the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.660
 dry ingredients and pour ours 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.239
 mother ricotta egg mass just above 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.290
 on it and touch the whole carefully 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.180
 a magic or with a wooden spoon 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.950
 with some yellow life between color 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.800
 I tried from the supermarket 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.080
 my dough to make some money 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.220
 but that did not really work 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.840
 As you can see here 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.640
 that's why you can do it easily 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.910
 leave out or you use one 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.100
 high quality color now is the dough 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.549
 finished and I can order them in portions 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.220
 Put on a sheet of baking paper for it 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.019
 I use an ice portioner 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.120
 with the cookies about the same size 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.130
 something should be natural, of course 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.319
 still be between the dough portions 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.370
 because the cookies baked something else 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.160
 be absorbed 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.560
 the state should still be for 10 15 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.930
 minutes in the fridge and then you can 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.790
 it in the oven 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.720
 depending on the size of the dough portion is enough 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.180
 a baking time of 6 10 minutes from the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.790
 glaze of these cookies is just 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.209
 a must and without you the biscuits only half 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.459
 I use a sheet of metal so well 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.769
 100 grams of powdered sugar and the abrasion of 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.140
 a lemon which I then mix 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.299
 then comes the lemon juice that 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.769
 would then have to make an eye as much 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.609
 powdered sugar that still good 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.500
 can record 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.810
 through the lemon peel in the glaze 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.359
 see the cookies at the end then very much 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.150
 Send me the finished glaze 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.730
 Put in a freezer bag and a 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.650
 small tip cut off so that there 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.760
 a small hole is where the glaze 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.560
 can get along 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.140
 I simply tried in the 19th century 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.709
 a little bit of lust and whimsy 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.259
 to decorate cookies 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.880
 but of course you could be in klausur 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.949
 also with a spoon or with a spoon 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.289
 brush on the box on it 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.300
 From the look you get this 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.919
 cookies certainly still pretty out there 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.690
 I can only say that 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.090
 taste is I was once moderately 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.580
 I would definitely bake it 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.660
 I hope the video has you fun and 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.639
 appetite made 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.410
 Try these biscuits in any case 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.479
 and see you next time 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.479
 video again then bite
