00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.960 
I keep telling myself that this is going
to<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.270> like<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:04.049> last<00:00:04.200> video<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.640> make

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.720 
but then I keep watching other videos
and<00:00:07.470> reading<00:00:07.770> at<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> comments<00:00:08.400> meeting<00:00:08.639> all

amok<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:33.960> feral<00:00:34.710> beasts<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.579> they're

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
amok like feral beasts you know they're

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.900 
amok like feral beasts you know they're
hitting<00:00:36.000> each<00:00:36.149> other<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:37.340> plastic<00:00:38.340> swords

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
hitting each other with plastic swords

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930

and playing video games and the video

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
and playing video games and the video
makes<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.420> seem<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.930> that's<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.469> do

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
makes it seem like that's all they do

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
makes it seem like that's all they do
every<00:00:43.890> day<00:00:44.040> first<00:00:44.610> off<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.910> don't<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.270> that's

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
every day first off I don't think that's

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
every day first off I don't think that's
the<00:00:45.690> whole<00:00:45.840> story<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.070> know

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the whole story I think you know

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.880 
the whole story I think you know
obviously<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> media<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
obviously we all know that the media and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
obviously we all know that the media and
news<00:00:50.070> organizations<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.850> select<00:00:51.149> clips<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
news organizations can select clips that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
news organizations can select clips that
emphasize<00:00:52.140> their<00:00:52.379> viewpoint<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.640> think

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
emphasize their viewpoint and I think

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.189 
emphasize their viewpoint and I think
Good<00:00:53.969> Morning<00:00:54.210> America<00:00:54.539> chose<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> clips

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
Good Morning America chose the clips

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.920 
Good Morning America chose the clips
that<00:00:55.500> emphasize<00:00:56.039> they're<00:00:56.309> pretty<00:00:57.300> obvious

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that emphasize they're pretty obvious

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.680 
that emphasize they're pretty obvious
bias<00:00:58.800> towards<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> situation<00:01:00.170> um<00:01:01.170> okay<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
bias towards the situation um okay so

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
bias towards the situation um okay so
with<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.870> taken<00:01:04.619> into<00:01:04.860> consideration<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
with that taken into consideration that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.859 
with that taken into consideration that
it's<00:01:05.670> probably<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> whole<00:01:06.450> story<00:01:06.479> those

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it's probably not the whole story those

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's probably not the whole story those
there's<00:01:07.049> probably<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.439> doing<00:01:07.710> other<00:01:07.830> things

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's probably are doing other things

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.550 
there's probably are doing other things

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
looking at that video and watching those

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.479 
looking at that video and watching those
kids<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.530> thinking<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:10.890> I'm<00:03:11.010> schooling<00:03:11.310> is

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
kids and thinking that I'm schooling is

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.940 
kids and thinking that I'm schooling is
failing<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.120> yeah<00:03:12.510> maybe<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.620> I

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
failing with it yeah maybe it is but I

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.670 
failing with it yeah maybe it is but I
bet<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.060> exceeding<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.660> lot<00:03:15.810> more<00:03:15.989> often<00:03:16.380> and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
bet it's exceeding a lot more often and

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.010 
bet it's exceeding a lot more often and
the<00:03:17.130> school<00:03:17.340> system<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.850> failing<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.900> it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
the school system is failing to and it

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.600 
the school system is failing to and it
fails<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.590> lot<00:03:19.980> harder<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.300> mean<00:03:22.220> when<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> kid

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
