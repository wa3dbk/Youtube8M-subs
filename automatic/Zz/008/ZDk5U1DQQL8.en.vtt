this<00:00:31.660> together<00:00:32.660> with<00:00:32.990> Kodak<00:00:33.440> we<00:00:33.710> have

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
this together with Kodak we have

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.410 
this together with Kodak we have
developed<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:35.270> new<00:00:35.710> sensor<00:00:36.710> which<00:00:37.400> has<00:00:37.820> smaller

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
developed a new sensor which has smaller

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.360 
developed a new sensor which has smaller
pixels<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.200> good<00:00:39.740> news<00:00:39.890> about<00:00:39.920> that<00:00:40.160> is

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
pixels and the good news about that is

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.730 
pixels and the good news about that is
that<00:00:40.550> our<00:00:41.060> lenses<00:00:41.540> can<00:00:41.780> easily<00:00:42.140> resolve<00:00:42.560> those

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
that our lenses can easily resolve those

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.820 
that our lenses can easily resolve those

gives<00:00:46.160> you<00:00:46.400> at<00:00:46.970> least<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:48.080> same<00:00:48.850> dynamic

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
gives you at least the same dynamic

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.430 
gives you at least the same dynamic

with your competitors coming out with
higher<00:01:15.409> megapixel<00:01:16.189> cameras<00:01:16.610> with<00:01:16.939> all<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
higher megapixel cameras with all the

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.310 
higher megapixel cameras with all the
different<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:19.850> know<00:01:19.970> special<00:01:20.780> effects<00:01:21.170> on

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
different you know special effects on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.800 
different you know special effects on
them<00:01:21.500> that<00:01:22.340> they're<00:01:22.580> asking<00:01:22.970> question<00:01:23.390> do<00:01:23.750> I

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
them that they're asking question do I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.649 
them that they're asking question do I
need<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.649> medium<00:01:25.490> format<00:01:25.789> camera<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.539> your

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
need a medium format camera and your

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.200 
need a medium format camera and your
answer<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.020> absolutely<00:01:27.320> yes<00:01:27.880> yes<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.090> think

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
answer is absolutely yes yes I think

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.550 
answer is absolutely yes yes I think
that<00:01:29.689> especially<00:01:30.820> colors<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.350> dynamic<00:01:33.350> range

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
that especially colors and dynamic range

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.010 
that especially colors and dynamic range
is<00:01:33.830> where<00:01:34.789> you<00:01:34.970> really<00:01:35.000> see<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.840> big

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
is where you really see the big

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.580 
is where you really see the big
difference<00:01:36.229> from<00:01:36.710> our<00:01:37.280> H<00:01:37.610> 3d<00:01:38.000> cameras<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.810> 35

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
actually are to see the difference and

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.609 
actually are to see the difference and
also<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.689> zoom<00:02:02.929> lens<00:02:02.959> is<00:02:03.560> new<00:02:03.770> yeah<00:02:04.640> we<00:02:05.119> have

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
also the zoom lens is new yeah we have

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.599 
also the zoom lens is new yeah we have
made<00:02:06.619> our<00:02:06.830> first<00:02:08.110> digital<00:02:09.110> design<00:02:09.560> zoom<00:02:10.369> lens

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:10.609 
made our first digital design zoom lens

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.490 
made our first digital design zoom lens
that<00:02:10.970> actually<00:02:11.450> takes<00:02:11.630> full<00:02:11.900> advantage<00:02:12.019> of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
that actually takes full advantage of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.569 
that actually takes full advantage of
our<00:02:12.680> digital<00:02:13.660> lens<00:02:14.660> Corrections<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
our digital lens Corrections and at the

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.300 
our digital lens Corrections and at the
same<00:02:16.790> time<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:18.049> first<00:02:18.320> lens<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.920> has<00:02:18.950> an

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
same time is the first lens that has an

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.640 
same time is the first lens that has an
aspheric<00:02:19.820> lens<00:02:20.030> element<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.079> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
aspheric lens element in it and that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.340 
aspheric lens element in it and that
means<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:23.000> make<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.450> much<00:02:24.320> more

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
means that we can make a much more
