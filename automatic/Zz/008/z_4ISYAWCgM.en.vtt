00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.960 
the story a hand so I go into the
cafeteria<00:02:12.170> upstairs<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.400> could<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.940> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
cafeteria upstairs and I could have a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.780 
cafeteria upstairs and I could have a
new<00:02:14.270> red<00:02:14.540> bowl<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.260> looks<00:02:15.860> very<00:02:16.220> similar<00:02:16.520> to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
new red bowl it looks very similar to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.760 
new red bowl it looks very similar to
the<00:02:16.940> sugar<00:02:17.270> free<00:02:17.540> redbull<00:02:17.780> now<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.440> sugar

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
the sugar free redbull now the sugar

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.070 
the sugar free redbull now the sugar
free<00:02:18.980> redbull<00:02:21.580> has<00:02:22.580> do<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:22.940> gram<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.330> sugar<00:02:23.510> I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
free redbull has do a gram of sugar I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.430 
free redbull has do a gram of sugar I
guess<00:02:24.680> that's<00:02:24.890> why<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.100> should<00:02:25.370> go<00:02:25.460> free<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:27.320> it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
guess that's why I should go free but it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.480 
guess that's why I should go free but it
does<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.950> 10<00:02:28.250> calories<00:02:29.020> um<00:02:30.020> as<00:02:31.010> far<00:02:31.370> as

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
does have 10 calories um as far as

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.180 
does have 10 calories um as far as
caloric<00:02:32.000> intake<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:33.170> has<00:02:33.320> less<00:02:33.650> than<00:02:33.680> 1

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
caloric intake and it has less than 1

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.410 
caloric intake and it has less than 1
gram<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:35.030> protein<00:02:36.520> yeah<00:02:37.520> who<00:02:37.820> cares<00:02:38.060> about<00:02:38.210> the

figure<00:03:35.140> but<00:03:36.140> I'm<00:03:36.410> going<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.830> open<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.340> and

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
figure but I'm going to open this and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.460 
figure but I'm going to open this and
try<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:38.420> haven't<00:03:38.810> seen<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.290> one<00:03:39.350> before<00:03:39.709> so

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
try I haven't seen this one before so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.750 
try I haven't seen this one before so
I'm<00:03:42.470> excited<00:03:44.290> zero<00:03:45.290> calories<00:03:45.920> oh<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.670> this

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
I'm excited zero calories oh and this

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600 
I'm excited zero calories oh and this
one<00:03:46.970> also<00:03:47.180> has<00:03:47.650> 60<00:03:48.650> milligrams<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.370> sodium

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
one also has 60 milligrams of sodium

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.460 
one also has 60 milligrams of sodium
which<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.150> not<00:03:50.300> much<00:03:50.330> less<00:03:50.810> than<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.110> sugar

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
which is not much less than the sugar

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.920 
which is not much less than the sugar
free<00:03:51.680> one<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:53.090> let's<00:03:53.450> try<00:03:53.870> it

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
don't like the original red bull because

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.520 
don't like the original red bull because

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
because it has enough amount of

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.680 
because it has enough amount of
sweetness<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.560> sourness<00:05:30.449> combination<00:05:31.449> like

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
sweetness and sourness combination like
