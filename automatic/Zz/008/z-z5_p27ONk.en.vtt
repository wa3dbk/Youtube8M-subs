00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.920
 their nose and right now in the Guiana region is a relatively good area 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.670
 preserved in terms of biodiversity the forest massifs still almost 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.540
 intact what has become unfortunately basin-wide dirhams 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.849
 Amazon 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.919
 about him 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.779
 the lag and coastal diversity and screw up relatively well preserved 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.070
 my soul in the region as soon as there is particularly the haze of microphones 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.179
 in this Andean region last standing dance everyone 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.739
 the animal and still quite mysterious 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.739
 we still have a lot to discover about its georgian bubble 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.539
 we know already that he is capable 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.730
 westwood added the amazing 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.920
 especially in terms of 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.580
 eat she has the ability 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.920
 up to 1000 meters deep 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.780
 the leatherback turtle is an animal that is really 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.070
 really fascinating also in terms of displacements since she is able to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.220
 to travel thousands of kilometers 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.220
 at the end of his pro season for example after leaving 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 he is able to leave just 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410
 it especially by all 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.600
 requires both very advanced guidance abilities 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.040
 and of course abilities to move swimming abilities that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.840
 me what always strikes me when I have the chance to witness the laying of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.250
 leatherback turtles in guyana that's thinking 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.440
 these little turtles and who will be born two months you can also 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.180
 find the hero 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.909
 to return after a few years a few decades 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.770
 to breed in the in the same region account 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.190
 really based a minute show-debate of the magnificent nature 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.550
 current values 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.550
 we have the chance to deduce a vowel it is relatively easy 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.450
 finally for death you know that you have really blatant 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 the last ten years it was the beginning of a huge 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.179
 although she noticed in particular on the product sites not to trust 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.949
 it's a species that has just been made 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.239
 in imminent danger of extinction internationally which is a 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.280
 huge stake 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.819
 protection of this species 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.819
 he exiles himself in french guiana as suriname as 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.659
 until we tried it is the perfecta illustration purpose problems 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.079
 current for sea turtles in the nights anne 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.079
 and use according to philippe drifting gill etc 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:42.329
 nor accidentally catches a lot of leatherback turtles in particular 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.289
 what we have here is a subject we found about a month ago 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.199
 who was rich but on the beach 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 and that contained a note 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.399
 in one a survivor a miracle of the dream 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:59.829
 from those of this real trap 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.499
 and that's a little what happens 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.449
 daily money signs of progress 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.299
 with this use 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.499
 there is no peace 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.499
 all kinds of fish 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.499
 ap ap also a lot of turtle 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.510
 and that's probably the biggest problem for the survival of 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.509
 the species in the alpine dotted 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.809
 to protect a species well is threatened from the door 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.789
 I have workers 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.029
 the field of research 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.429
 the vfb that allows me half 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.429
 contact with that world-class poll 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.329
 at the end of the exchanges of course 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.529
 we have a project and that really is extremely important for us to 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:44.469
 the current time 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.509
 satellite tracking projects the travels the leatherback turtle 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.329
 so the different tags have been installed 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.079
 we will take exactly what their displacements 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.329
 during their long season 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.329
 but also beyond between two melt seasons 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.099
 until a few months ago nobody 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.019
 given answer and thanks to the research team who are working 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.089
 directly on this issue we start to see elements 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:10.569
 very important 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.569
 to better protect this species 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.740
 another example of research applied to the protection of the leatherback turtle 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 that's what we've seen before on a soul that's what's happening right now 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.169
 on a ream with fellini 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.939
 from paramaribo university 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.249
 who worked on ecology 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.770
 the idea is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.409
 understand well depending on the different places in the Portuguese vote 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.020
 the seasonal on a beach to understand what are the places on 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.500
 which lafonta really gave from the eighth gold you 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.449
 to also identify in reverse his place where a deposited funds will be 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.229
 lost 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.419
 because of a flood has concluded 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.330
 erosion about wearing the title 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.770
 so it's also concrete results that are expected with support 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.839
 physical phenomena really concerns sea turtles in the 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.849
 ten years is the attraction that it exercises near douai 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.639
 and we did a lot of 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.979
 he comes on AIDS 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.949
 we realize that our reach 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.800
 we have the chance to attend the show 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.129
 nesting sea turtles 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.699
 date marked for life 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.960
 this is what allows the wwf to attract attention 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.680
 general public in general be preserving these two of these 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.469
 cash 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.089
 the leatherback turtle in part 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.990
 but considered as the most emblematic species 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.309
 protection 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.309
 coastal diversity 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.999
 as for me, I have the chance to see the day 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:59.139
 he returns to sea 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.339
 but I'm thinking of course of all the efforts 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.669
 ronnie scientist from a protection point of view of these species but I think 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.129
 also to my children 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.249
 and I tell myself is about 15 years old 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.249
 let's say the chance to attend this show as it exists today 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.029
 I am quite optimistic in the day and then a dinner and a nice synergy 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.449
 between bignona suriname 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.340
 and Guyana 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.330
 to preserve 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.870
 it is a beautiful garden of Mount Athos raised m but we know we have five 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.300
 banks 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.860
 gold to succeed this bet 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.270
 otherwise we will all have found the disappearance of this species 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.800
 not just a region 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.680
 but on a global scale
