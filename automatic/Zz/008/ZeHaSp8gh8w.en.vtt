00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 boil we simply apply the water 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.930
 boiling and let them sit there 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.020
 until they are more or less taking 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.580
 a color like pink well and week more 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.400

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.790
 I'm going to take the dried shrimp and the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.380
 I'm going to place 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.380

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.860

 elapsed more or less 10 minutes 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.640

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.640
 add the big onion 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.280
 and let's let it rest there 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.660
 another mouse another 10 minutes or so 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.660
 so that the onion 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:56.100
 lose a little the strong flavor 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.350
 and try to crystallize 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.350
 to mix well with the shrimp 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.700
 well another ten minutes after having 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.229

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.120
 a little cilantro or parsley if you want 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.930
 It is not necessary 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.750
 it is also rich without that is like something 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.850
 additional 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.760
