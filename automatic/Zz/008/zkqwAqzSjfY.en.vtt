00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.580
 We will be back at Ludwigsburg me 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.080
 I'm back with wine and that is today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.370
 on 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.450
 Mitschek again turn on the no has 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.740
 me an e mail written 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.090
 I already have some videos 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.189
 you turned on a lot about that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.779
 muscle-building achieved the worker also 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.830
 about repetition numbers exercises you have 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.720
 already spoken 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 my question to you what I still have 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 we did not really understand 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
 no one has ever explained that is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 ask how many repetitions and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 I should put in my workout 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.719
 if my only goal is the definition 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 my body is 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.829
 i would like to get muscle once 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.539
 bring muscle build up and stronger 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.030
 but not or only 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.620
 I will be slightly wider 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 realizing that we have one 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.500
 Wish the point reached at some point 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 you can not get higher with the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.980
 weight can go 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.590
 this is not as important to me as it is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.050
 we in swabia say wilk 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 place will help 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.189
 Do you still want me to dry or 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.420
 another method would be better for 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.760
 Of course, there is a definition 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.850
 moreover , already out of the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.360
 had to grow is for 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 sport science someday 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 staked at six to twelve 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.830
 repeats 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 that means you have to go there anyway 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.619
 go out if you have this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.689
 muscle growth is no longer so 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.310
 To put on extreme means that means you have to 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 do twelve repetitions with them 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.610
 but back to 15 repetitions 15 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.590
 repeat until 20 what you do with it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.360
 if you are in the high 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 Repeat numbers range trained 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.750
 trained with low prices because you 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.210
 In the end, it can regenerate quickly 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 because the stimulus for the central nervous system 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.810
 not too high 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.119
 that means we train with hollow 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 Repeats high pulse low 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.890
 break that means we exhaust ours 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.200
 carbohydrate storage tangle the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.320
 glycogen stores are exhausted 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.450
 that means very much in combination with too 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.270
 a high repetition training 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 you should definitely be one afterward 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.540
 Haiti is an interval of high intensity 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.280
 do interval training cardio or 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.940
 intense piano for 15 minutes 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.190
 give it a good gas because it's easy 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.959
 that could get the best out of the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.360
 already exhaustive passes store 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.560
 or cortisol release too high 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.280
 Get cortisol is a stress hormone 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.879
 of the muscle degrades and that is just after 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.950
 45 minutes already yes is after 45 minutes 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.660
 already spilled in the masters 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.330
 but it is quite a lot 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.019
 that would be the best combination 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.849
 actually set up training of 45 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.569
 minutes and there we are now at the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.790
 ask for the maximum put the 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.220
 sentences should be adjusted more or less 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.030
 in number, that's just me 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.250
 as many sentences clearly as logical in 45 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.980
 minutes of time to pack 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.709
 45 minutes from first job to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.260
 for the last working day finished one end 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.909
 muscle group 20 come to me personally 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.440
 end effect no matter just because 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.390
 by definition, it is perhaps even 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.659
 where it does not stimulate this growth 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.030
 but would like to put 45 minutes first the 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.690
 last work sentence since behind 15 more 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.450
 minutes of haiti or intense keolis 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.290
 interval and then it is just after 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.819
 60 minutes to the end and then too 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 then you have to tell a 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.530
 Crosscheck offers white 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.060
 It's not about how much you're doing right now 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.769
 burned in training should be 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.569
 so this night an effect of the 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.940
 best to use next 24 hours 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.770
 and 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.330
 that means with the old extreme can 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.440
 Of course, go down because yes 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.510
 usually less and less 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.060
 carbohydrates should be eaten when you're in 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.080
 the definition phase, so to speak 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.600
 and 45 minutes power is in the 15 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.300
 minute interval or intense cardio 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.710
 and from the sentences here as much as that 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.770
 you have the 45 minutes done and before 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.390
 all repetitions over 12 or under 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.350
 Six, but I would not 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.960
 because it is already a big one 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.390
 Discrepancy is a big difference 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.609
 is between six and somehow 15 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.019
 So just repeat from twelve 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.019
 repetitions upwards
