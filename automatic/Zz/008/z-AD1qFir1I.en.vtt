00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
6000 meters of a game so it wasn't me

6000 meters of a game so it wasn't me
real<00:00:16.320> course<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.400> we're<00:00:17.940> kind<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.210> pass<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
real course but we're kind of pass the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.700 
real course but we're kind of pass the
time<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:20.390> still<00:00:21.390> challenging<00:00:21.900> yeah

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
time at this still challenging yeah

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
time at this still challenging yeah
because<00:00:23.130> every<00:00:23.519> race<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.970> challenging<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.570> his

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
because every race is challenging in his

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.470 
because every race is challenging in his
own<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.090> completely<00:00:27.090> before

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
own way but it was a completely before

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
own way but it was a completely before
grace<00:00:27.830> did<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.920> approach<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.369> differently<00:00:29.609> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
grace did you approach it differently I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
grace did you approach it differently I
mean<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:31.759> yeah<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:32.790> guess<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.239> friday<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
mean and yeah i guess and friday was it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250 
mean and yeah i guess and friday was it
was<00:00:38.010> quite<00:00:38.309> hard<00:00:38.480> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.600> waiting<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
was quite hard you know waiting for the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
was quite hard you know waiting for the
news<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> happen<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
news of what was going to happen and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
news of what was going to happen and
then<00:00:42.649> readjusting<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.980> thoughts<00:00:44.989> but<00:00:45.989> i

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
then readjusting your thoughts but i

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
then readjusting your thoughts but i
guess<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.550> an<00:00:47.700> ultra<00:00:48.030> distance<00:00:48.390> race<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
guess with an ultra distance race you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.709 
guess with an ultra distance race you
have<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.200> prepared<00:00:49.760> for<00:00:50.760> whatever<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
have to be prepared for whatever the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
have to be prepared for whatever the
race<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> throw<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.039> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
race is going to throw at you and in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400 
race is going to throw at you and in
this<00:00:53.730> case<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.989> race<00:00:55.140> wasn't

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this case it was that the race wasn't

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.560 
this case it was that the race wasn't
happening<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> completely

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
happening and it was be a completely

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.010 
happening and it was be a completely
different<00:00:57.930> force<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.690> you<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.870> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
different force so and you really just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.759 
different force so and you really just
have<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.609> try<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> stay<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.660> moment<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
have to try and stay in the moment and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820 
have to try and stay in the moment and
just<00:01:05.610> keep<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.119> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> equanimity

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
just keep that kind of equanimity

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.350 
just keep that kind of equanimity
what<00:01:09.430> goes<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:09.820> goes<00:01:10.060> on<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.570> why

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
what goes on goes on and why

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
what goes on goes on and why
so<00:01:13.360> just<00:01:15.000> stay<00:01:16.000> in

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so just stay in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.819 
so just stay in
yeah<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:19.110> race<00:01:19.289> typically<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.360> aggressive<00:01:21.829> I

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
sorry can't do pace conversion two

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
sorry can't do pace conversion two
kilometers<00:01:36.560> but<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.600> yeah<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> guess<00:01:40.020> my

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
kilometers but and yeah I guess my

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.709 
kilometers but and yeah I guess my
strategy<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.640> race<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.450> run<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
strategy for any race is just to run the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.499 
strategy for any race is just to run the
best<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.649> kind<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.280> each<00:01:44.460> moment<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
best I can at kind of each moment of the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.199 
best I can at kind of each moment of the
race<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> don't<00:01:47.640> intentionally<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.990> out

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
race and so I don't intentionally go out

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.720 
race and so I don't intentionally go out
aggressively<00:01:51.209> but

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
aggressively but

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.859 
aggressively but
just<00:01:54.390> kind<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.690> happy<00:01:54.900> with<00:01:55.140> them

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
in 10 years I have to say I've never run

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.260 
in 10 years I have to say I've never run
the<00:03:07.300> course<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:07.660> run<00:03:07.840> yesterday<00:03:08.080> but<00:03:09.990> sure<00:03:12.270> do

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
the course we run yesterday but sure do

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.600 
the course we run yesterday but sure do
you<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:14.260> pay<00:03:14.590> taking<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.070> break<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.430> near

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
you just pay taking a break in the near

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.750 
you just pay taking a break in the near
future<00:03:15.640> or<00:03:16.590> yeah<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.250> definitely<00:03:18.700> a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
future or yeah it's it's definitely a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.640 
future or yeah it's it's definitely a
race<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.120> can't<00:03:19.390> run<00:03:19.870> every<00:03:20.170> year<00:03:20.410> just

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
race you can't run every year just

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.680 
race you can't run every year just
because<00:03:20.860> it's<00:03:21.190> not<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.610> only<00:03:21.730> race<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.450> there

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
because it's not the only race and there

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.380 
because it's not the only race and there
