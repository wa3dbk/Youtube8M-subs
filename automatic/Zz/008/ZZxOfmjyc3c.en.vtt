paint shop and I will what you see looks
like<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> environment

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.180 

almost

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.530 

getting<00:00:52.910> there<00:00:54.640> here<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:55.760> go<00:00:55.940> alright<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:58.540> let

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
getting there here we go alright so let

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.990 
getting there here we go alright so let
me<00:00:59.630> pull<00:00:59.870> it<00:00:59.960> into<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.170> sunlight<00:01:01.000> at

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.230 
me pull it into the sunlight at
nighttime<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.690> looks<00:01:02.870> different<00:01:04.330> but<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:08.060> can

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
nighttime it looks different but you can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.120 
nighttime it looks different but you can
you<00:01:08.540> probably<00:01:09.020> be<00:01:09.140> able<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.380> see<00:01:09.560> for<00:01:09.740> yourself

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
you probably be able to see for yourself

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.930 
you probably be able to see for yourself
when<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.700> actually<00:01:11.180> do<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:11.690> but<00:01:12.940> the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
when you do actually do this but the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.790 
when you do actually do this but the
shine<00:01:14.300> is<00:01:14.810> definitely<00:01:15.229> different<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:15.680> I

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
shine is definitely different like I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.380 
shine is definitely different like I
said<00:01:16.010> multiple<00:01:16.700> times<00:01:16.940> then<00:01:17.450> metallic<00:01:18.170> and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
said multiple times then metallic and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.550 
said multiple times then metallic and
the<00:01:20.390> shading<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:20.960> different

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the shading is different

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.060 
the shading is different
there's<00:01:22.400> more<00:01:22.580> shading<00:01:23.030> involved<00:01:23.890> that's<00:01:24.890> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
there's more shading involved that's the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.830 
there's more shading involved that's the
black<00:01:25.250> part<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.910> car<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.300> you<00:01:26.420> see<00:01:26.630> there

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.430 
black part on the car that you see there
is<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:28.190> shading<00:01:28.700> on<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> side<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:30.140> I'm

and<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.459> can<00:03:35.669> divide<00:03:35.969> them<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.409> you<00:03:37.409> can<00:03:37.560> have

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and you can divide them and you can have

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.149 
and you can divide them and you can have
like<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.370> side<00:03:38.730> Ruby<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.599> other<00:03:39.750> side

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
green in the paint or it's more like a

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.610 
green in the paint or it's more like a
turquoise<00:04:53.190> color<00:04:53.780> when<00:04:54.780> they're<00:04:54.960> mixed<00:04:55.169> but
