rod cover but I like it the feature I
don't<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.110> on<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:50.150> one<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.360> they

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
don't like on this and one that they

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.120 
don't like on this and one that they
actually<00:03:51.750> used<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.110> selling<00:03:52.530> point<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.890> this

kill switch which I find to be

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.910 
kill switch which I find to be
completely<00:03:55.980> useless<00:03:57.260> at<00:03:58.260> least<00:03:58.440> musically

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
which is what I think they intended to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.200 
which is what I think they intended to
do<00:04:00.800> you<00:04:01.800> know<00:04:01.920> ever<00:04:02.220> since<00:04:02.340> bucketheads<00:04:03.000> been

using this kill switch the kids become

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.580 
using this kill switch the kids become
very<00:04:05.640> popular<00:04:05.820> however<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:07.290> kill

very popular however this this kill

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.740 
very popular however this this kill

you know button switch since it locks

flip it which makes using it musically
difficult<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.030> say<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.330> least<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> ultimately

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
difficult to say the least so ultimately

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.500 
difficult to say the least so ultimately
the<00:04:23.460> only<00:04:23.610> thing<00:04:23.730> it's<00:04:23.850> good<00:04:23.880> for<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> kill

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
the only thing it's good for is a kill

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
switch which you just use your knob for

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.570

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
as far as the actual build quality I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.250 
as far as the actual build quality I
found<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.090> pretty<00:04:36.390> good<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.660> thought<00:04:37.020> the

found it to be pretty good I thought the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.990 
found it to be pretty good I thought the
factory<00:04:37.770> setup<00:04:38.040> was<00:04:38.280> fine<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:41.430> course<00:04:41.670> I<00:04:41.790> put

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
factory setup was fine of course I put

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.690 
factory setup was fine of course I put

different strings on it I have had a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.670 
different strings on it I have had a

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
issue with getting the intonation and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.940 
issue with getting the intonation and
the<00:04:46.830> upper<00:04:47.100> registers<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.300> perfect<00:04:48.950> I'm

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
the upper registers to be perfect I'm

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.020 
the upper registers to be perfect I'm
still<00:04:50.220> working<00:04:50.520> on<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:52.160> assuming<00:04:53.160> some

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
still working on that assuming some

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.750 
still working on that assuming some
minor<00:04:54.750> annoyance<00:04:55.260> right<00:04:55.500> now<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.950> haven't<00:04:56.640> had

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
minor annoyance right now I haven't had

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.420 
minor annoyance right now I haven't had
any<00:04:56.970> issues<00:04:57.090> with<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.510> frets<00:04:57.810> being<00:04:58.110> like

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
any issues with the frets being like

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.450 
any issues with the frets being like
improperly<00:04:59.430> dressed<00:04:59.730> or<00:05:01.310> sticking<00:05:02.310> out

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
improperly dressed or sticking out

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.860 
improperly dressed or sticking out
anywhere<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.880> read<00:05:03.150> some<00:05:03.330> reviews<00:05:03.480> people

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
anywhere I read some reviews people

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.270 
anywhere I read some reviews people
talking<00:05:04.230> about<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.560> but<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:04.800> don't<00:05:05.040> have<00:05:05.130> any

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
talking about that but I don't have any

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.880 
talking about that but I don't have any
problems<00:05:05.580> with<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:07.470> those<00:05:07.650> are<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
problems with that so those are the

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.540 
problems with that so those are the
features<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> build<00:05:10.400> overall<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.460> think

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
features in the build overall I think

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.330 
features in the build overall I think
this<00:05:11.760> guitar<00:05:12.180> is<00:05:12.210> great<00:05:12.630> by<00:05:13.010> right<00:05:14.010> out<00:05:14.190> of<00:05:14.220> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
this guitar is great by right out of the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.460 
this guitar is great by right out of the
box<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:15.030> think<00:05:15.930> there's<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> lot<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.290> people

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
box I think there's a lot of people

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.519 
box I think there's a lot of people
don't<00:05:16.860> want<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.220> shell<00:05:17.520> out

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
don't want to shell out

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:21.189 
don't want to shell out
grand<00:05:19.009> or<00:05:19.189> more<00:05:19.269> from<00:05:20.269> nice<00:05:20.449> guitar<00:05:20.869> but<00:05:21.109> the

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
grand or more from nice guitar but the

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.099 
grand or more from nice guitar but the
same<00:05:21.409> time<00:05:21.619> it's<00:05:21.889> like<00:05:22.209> you<00:05:23.209> spent<00:05:23.509> 300<00:05:23.899> bucks

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:24.109 
same time it's like you spent 300 bucks

00:05:24.109 --> 00:05:26.199 
same time it's like you spent 300 bucks
and<00:05:24.409> you<00:05:25.219> get<00:05:25.399> something<00:05:25.699> with<00:05:25.819> really<00:05:26.089> bad

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:26.209 
and you get something with really bad

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.179 
and you get something with really bad
pick<00:05:26.479> up<00:05:26.629> so<00:05:26.719> you<00:05:26.779> can<00:05:26.929> definitely<00:05:27.769> hear<00:05:28.009> the

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189 
pick up so you can definitely hear the

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.219
