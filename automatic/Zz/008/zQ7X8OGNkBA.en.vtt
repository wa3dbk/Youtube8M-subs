the example I'm giving you here is I'm
gonna<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> demoing<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> beats<00:00:48.090> by

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
gonna be demoing this with the beats by

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
gonna be demoing this with the beats by
dre<00:00:48.300> headphones<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.410> most<00:00:49.649> headphones<00:00:49.829> work

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
dre headphones but most headphones work

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.100 
dre headphones but most headphones work
the<00:00:50.399> same<00:00:50.550> exact<00:00:50.789> way<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> only<00:00:51.809> difference

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the same exact way and only difference

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.330 
the same exact way and only difference
might<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.559> button<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> would<00:00:53.190> use
