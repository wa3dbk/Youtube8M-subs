Dipper<00:02:20.040> had<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> start<00:02:20.640> here<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.360> had

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
Dipper had to start here and then it had

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.809 
Dipper had to start here and then it had
to<00:02:21.569> start<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.129> here<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.489> there

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
to start here and here and here so there

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.850 
to start here and here and here so there
was<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.140> multi-dimensional<00:02:26.989> arena<00:02:27.989> that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
was this multi-dimensional arena that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.780 
was this multi-dimensional arena that
opened<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.579> me<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:31.430> with<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.579> in<00:02:32.760> mind

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
opened up to me so with this in mind

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.390 
opened up to me so with this in mind
with<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.329> analogy

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
with this analogy

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.170 
with this analogy
in<00:02:34.459> thinking<00:02:35.120> about<00:02:36.099> this<00:02:37.099> perspective<00:02:37.489> of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
in thinking about this perspective of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.199 
in thinking about this perspective of
the<00:02:38.750> podium<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.470> 300<00:02:40.340> or<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.760> people<00:02:41.000> in

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the podium and the 300 or so people in

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.850 
the podium and the 300 or so people in
the<00:02:41.330> room<00:02:41.510> having<00:02:42.470> their<00:02:42.709> own<00:02:42.860> perspective

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
the room having their own perspective

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.220 
the room having their own perspective
isn't<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.819> simultaneous<00:02:47.690> but<00:02:47.900> isn't

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
isn't it is it's simultaneous but isn't

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.970 
isn't it is it's simultaneous but isn't
there<00:02:48.349> even<00:02:48.530> more<00:02:48.920> expansion<00:02:49.640> beyond<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:51.560> I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
there even more expansion beyond that I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.550 
there even more expansion beyond that I
mean<00:02:52.580> I'm<00:02:52.730> seeing<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.360> hearing<00:02:53.569> if<00:02:53.959> it's<00:02:54.379> my

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
mean I'm seeing and hearing if it's my

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
simultaneously happening for them as

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.080 
simultaneously happening for them as
well<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:23.060> other<00:03:23.209> words<00:03:23.420> like<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.530> light<00:03:28.090> like

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
well in other words like the light like

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.940 
well in other words like the light like
the<00:03:29.329> light<00:03:30.290> bug<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.579> Firefly<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.709> that

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
the light bug of the Firefly is is that

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.319 
the light bug of the Firefly is is that
that<00:03:34.400> what's<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.150> what's

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
that what's that is that what's

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.280 
that what's that is that what's
happening<00:03:35.860> simultaneously<00:03:39.280> well<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.970> began

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
happening simultaneously well we began

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.229 
happening simultaneously well we began
when<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.530> address<00:03:42.859> this<00:03:43.100> question<00:03:43.280> earlier<00:03:43.760> by

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
when we address this question earlier by

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.809 
when we address this question earlier by
talking<00:03:44.660> about<00:03:45.250> perspective<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.630> our

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
talking about perspective and our

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.879 
talking about perspective and our
previous<00:03:49.819> questioner<00:03:50.540> did<00:03:51.079> a<00:03:51.109> good<00:03:51.319> job<00:03:51.380> of

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
previous questioner did a good job of

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.809 
previous questioner did a good job of
laying<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.000> groundwork<00:03:53.359> of<00:03:53.680> how<00:03:54.680> there<00:03:55.639> are

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
laying the groundwork of how there are

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.849 
laying the groundwork of how there are
different<00:03:56.180> perspectives<00:03:56.930> in<00:03:57.590> each

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
different perspectives in each

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.960 
different perspectives in each
perspective<00:03:58.579> is<00:03:58.700> unique<00:03:59.120> and<00:04:00.340> all<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.819> is

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
perspective is unique and all of that is

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.059 
perspective is unique and all of that is
true<00:04:02.209> all<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.840> that<00:04:02.989> is<00:04:03.109> true<00:04:03.410> all<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:03.919> is

but<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:07.400> contemplate<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.930> diversity<00:04:09.500> of

but to contemplate the diversity of

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
up with that perspective you will see

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.200 
up with that perspective you will see
vast<00:05:13.960> galaxies<00:05:14.830> beyond<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.639> which<00:05:15.970> your

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
vast galaxies beyond that which your

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.730 
vast galaxies beyond that which your

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
perspective first occasionally you do
