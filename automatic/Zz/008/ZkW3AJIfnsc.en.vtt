00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.410
 How do you guys react when 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 the kleber comes to the public and says that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.969
 players need more will 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.990
 My son, how do you state that there is missing 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.720
 quality to the palm team is difficult. 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.510
 Did you comment on opinions? 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.220
 but I spend the group and whether or you can 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.789
 eat one that you feel when you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 wins the moment that we are 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.189
 through a championship that people 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.300
 makes good games in the case of Fluminense in the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.160
 maracana 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 and when it seems that things are going 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.399
 to lead people to falter 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.739
 at home without a 2 to 0 cruise 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.360
 I would leave then I think for these 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.149
 results I think is not missing 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.910
 I do not think we are 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 racing but the phase when the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 phase is not good but I think we have 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.870
 that speak a little less and work 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.440
 work until Wednesday has a guild 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.629
 It's no use getting criticized 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.570
 Our cast is the time to play because it gives 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.540
 support for some players that is what 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.330
 not not see well right but who has everything 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.390
 to turn around the time to give 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.780
 support in the fact that we throw the towel 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 because the second round bet 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 to win as fast as possible has a 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 question for coach emerson lion 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.229
 about work really as 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 coach 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.630
 if he thinks there was insubordination of the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.610
 rogério ceni to the technician baresi when 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 were when the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.930
 players said that with others 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 coaches and players also 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 guess Rogério Ceni also gave 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.409
 guess another if you also accepted 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 came to accept orders from the rogério without 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.299
 help answer 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 We've never had interference in the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.390
 Paulo 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.149
 I have always enjoyed the greatest freedom and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 authority in there são paulo rogério 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.390
 ceni 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.829
 at the time we work there 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.860
 behaved professionally very well 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.780
 Nothing questioned anything questioned and much 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 on the contrary it was always outside 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.240
 so i'm weird 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.970
 any comparison I think everybody 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.480
 must have its own brightness 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.060
 you should not abuse that brightness just and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.530
 I once again affirm that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 I worked in Sao Paulo 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.170
 we had the happiness of being champion 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.470
 after that I had to 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.920
 transfer to Japan was marked by a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.010
 great tranquility, including the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.510
 athletes who played played with me in this 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.780
 opportunity until today we have a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.880
 excellent relationship specific case 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 so just to mention a nice example 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.530
 graffiti in the Father's Day he sent a 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.750
 and e-mail me telling me that I was the father. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.760
 of clothes is a fight and it's a healthy 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 the memory is important moments 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.320
 important that we live together and happy 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.790
 in football if you accept to run if you accept 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.590
 help from the player is what I wanted 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.989
 know easy maybe even the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 coach for being young is not yet 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.890
 with that whole safety as the athlete 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.980
 start to always play an opinion 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.220
 positive to offer is important now 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.799
 talking about football is the best thing 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.700
 What does the Leo technician have to do to you ? 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.880
 were 38 years old eight seem 37 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.120
 Did you play a day in the day? 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.980
 next won the Brazilian championship 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.630
 and on Monday the coach 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.920
 Sunday night he was the coach without 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.110
 hope to wait was not going to be okay 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.720
 of course he was not ready to 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.970
 to be a Brazilian champion 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.989
 It started there happened a fact happened 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.170
 very important to play of the day 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.630
 I left until another game would be final 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.530
 championship game seems to me passed 30 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.120
 days 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 so we had the opportunity to 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.090
 train 30 days following and then I trained 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.769
 as I wanted to forget the side and the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.380
 professional athlete and became a 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.130
 Coach I did not do two touch 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.200
 it was not funny then that 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.940
 who used to play with me every day 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.230
 play 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.190
 had to play inside a 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.130
 hierarchy 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.489
 he had to understand for the sake of himself 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.750
 that proximity would not work then 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.600
 those 30 days 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.640
 very well then the first training the 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.650
 according to the first week is a week 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.510
 of indecision 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.410
 coming back to talk about the rogério you have a 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.480
 The person who helps you becomes easier if 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.450
 Do you have an athlete who corrects mistakes? 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.640
 inside the field help too I had myself 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.280
 I had some athletes who played some 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.740
 with me on the field I do not 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.290
 I knew screaming for him to correct the 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.720
 his intelligence and his simplicity 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.030
 it was the sacrifice by the support team 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.090
 I can practice today. 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.130
 jorginho the little one that now 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.880
 captive today the black bridge coach 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.340
 person jorge silva please say jorge 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.740
 reached tired of helping understood 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.590
 he was already the coach already 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.810
 it's just the following look I 'm going to give 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.800
 attention you are correcting your 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.530
 companions 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.350
 You're not the coach, the coach here. 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.690
 It's me, then, if you listen and do things 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.180
 or not all right and that was the case 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.479
 way would be to think I was helping 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.210
 already saw the game saw people who 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.500
 easier the game than other people 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.870
 that's it 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.870
 ronaldo should play even overweight 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.810
 or you would only climb to play while 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.190
 in form and forleo with ronaldo and is the 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.360
 following the ronaldo is it has already defined 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.790
 his life 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.260
 professionally ronaldo has been there for 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.320
 Time at Corinthians I'm sorry you 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.169
 look a little hummer h2 to it has changed 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.330
 something in relation to observation 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.850
 his physics did not 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.590
 then it is already defined that the pomegranate or 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.900
 You accept what it is or it's broken. 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.370
 business now when he's there 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.340
 inside he knows how to play 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.860
 logical that she knows uses accepts the 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.350
 coaches the directors the supporter 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.690
 commentators accept as it is today 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.820
 and another then I think before 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.220
 getting on the coach passes by 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.729
 department and the department 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:31.050
 physical I think this is you give 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:33.780
 authority to their access to the command 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.949
 the people who work with you then 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.620
 I think so 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.110
 I think so now I can not even 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.360
 distance and do not even get into my head 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.169
 something that does not concern me 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.300
 I have but we all know how the 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.870
 great Corinthian who a year and a half ago 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.870
 was
