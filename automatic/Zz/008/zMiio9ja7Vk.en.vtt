00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
knife so the light catches it what you

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.280 
knife so the light catches it what you
can<00:00:54.100> do<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.520> you<00:00:54.670> can<00:00:54.760> take<00:00:54.880> a<00:00:54.940> lighter<00:00:55.240> this<00:00:56.140> is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
can do is you can take a lighter this is

can do is you can take a lighter this is
a<00:00:56.380> simple<00:00:56.650> butane<00:00:56.980> lighter<00:00:57.250> it's<00:00:57.850> not<00:00:57.970> working

very<00:00:58.270> well<00:00:58.420> right<00:00:58.600> now<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.730> basically<00:01:00.880> just

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
very well right now but basically just

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.900 
very well right now but basically just
put<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.380> up<00:01:02.470> to<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.680> blade<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.400> you<00:01:03.520> lab<00:01:03.730> like

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
put it up to the blade and you lab like

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.829 
put it up to the blade and you lab like
smudges<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.600> it

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
smudges to it

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.480 
smudges to it
I<00:01:04.869> have<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.140> take<00:01:05.290> very<00:01:05.500> long<00:01:05.680> on<00:01:05.830> this<00:01:05.950> maybe<00:01:06.189> a

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
I have to take very long on this maybe a

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.670 
I have to take very long on this maybe a
minute<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.630> you<00:01:07.810> can<00:01:07.930> already<00:01:08.049> tell<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.470> most

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
minute and you can already tell the most

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.420 
minute and you can already tell the most
of<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:08.950> reflective<00:01:09.900> finish<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:11.259> concealed<00:01:12.250> by

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
of the reflective finish is concealed by

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.280 
of the reflective finish is concealed by
this<00:01:12.490> much<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.509> nice<00:01:13.689> thing<00:01:13.960> about<00:01:14.020> this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
this much the nice thing about this

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.550 
this much the nice thing about this
modification<00:01:15.009> is<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.189> temporary<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:16.870> not<00:01:17.440> only

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
modification is a temporary so not only

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.140 
modification is a temporary so not only
can<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.830> just<00:01:18.070> do<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:18.220> really<00:01:18.430> quickly<00:01:18.760> so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
can you just do this really quickly so

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.490 
can you just do this really quickly so
there's<00:01:19.360> no<00:01:19.480> reflective<00:01:19.960> finish<00:01:20.110> on<00:01:20.350> your

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
there's no reflective finish on your

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.040

permanent<00:01:23.380> damage<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.860> done<00:01:24.120> unless<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.270> have

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
permanent damage is done unless you have

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.420 
permanent damage is done unless you have
a<00:01:25.420> knife<00:01:25.570> with<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.750> really<00:01:25.960> weak<00:01:26.140> finish<00:01:26.530> this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
a knife with a really weak finish this

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.219 
a knife with a really weak finish this
isn't<00:01:27.729> gonna<00:01:27.850> hurt<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.270> all<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.930> have<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.080> do<00:01:29.170> is

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
isn't gonna hurt it all I have to do is

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.580 
isn't gonna hurt it all I have to do is
kind<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.409> wet<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.280> rubs<00:01:30.670> right<00:01:30.790> off<00:01:31.030> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
kind of wet it and it rubs right off a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.750 
kind of wet it and it rubs right off a
lot<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.650> be<00:01:32.710> like<00:01:32.860> until<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.310> messed<00:01:33.490> up<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
lot to be like until you messed up the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.110 
lot to be like until you messed up the
temper<00:01:34.120> no<00:01:34.540> running<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.530> little<00:01:35.650> wider<00:01:36.090> over<00:01:37.090> a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
temper no running a little wider over a

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.910 
temper no running a little wider over a
knife<00:01:37.360> shortly<00:01:38.290> just<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.560> put<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.800> little

knife shortly just to put a little

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.620 
knife shortly just to put a little
smudge<00:01:39.220> effect<00:01:39.550> on<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.880> it's<00:01:40.030> not<00:01:40.180> going<00:01:40.450> to

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
smudge effect on it it's not going to

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.310 
smudge effect on it it's not going to
destroy<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.229> finish<00:01:42.600> next<00:01:43.600> modification

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320

reason why I did that I said that I can

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.880 
reason why I did that I said that I can
snag<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.330> on<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.020> corner<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.350> my<00:01:59.440> pocket<00:01:59.860> when

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
snag it on the corner of my pocket when

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.350 
snag it on the corner of my pocket when
I<00:01:59.979> draw<00:02:00.540> okay<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:02.500> that's<00:02:02.770> sort<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.369> an

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
I draw okay so that's sort of like an

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.770 
I draw okay so that's sort of like an
improvised<00:02:04.840> wave<00:02:05.229> feature<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.250> ninth<00:02:06.780> all

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
improvised wave feature to the ninth all

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.679 
improvised wave feature to the ninth all
right<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.200> snags<00:02:08.560> record<00:02:08.890> my<00:02:08.979> pocket

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
right so this snags record my pocket

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.300 
right so this snags record my pocket
very<00:02:10.689> self-explanatory<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.890> only<00:02:12.040> thing<00:02:12.220> I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
very self-explanatory the only thing I

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.220 
very self-explanatory the only thing I
would<00:02:12.459> mention<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.720> when<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
would mention is that when you do it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.759 
would mention is that when you do it
angle<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.400> knife<00:02:15.610> or<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.140> angle<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
angle the knife or the the angle of the

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.320 
angle the knife or the the angle of the
zip<00:02:17.950> tie<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.540> it's

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
zip tie so that it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.650 
zip tie so that it's
acute<00:02:21.110> with<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.880> part<00:02:23.150> being<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.390> straight

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
acute with this part being a straight

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
acute with this part being a straight
part<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:23.960> this<00:02:24.020> painting<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.440> clipped

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
part in this painting the clipped

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.260 
part in this painting the clipped
because<00:02:24.980> that'll<00:02:25.220> snag<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.640> your<00:02:25.790> pocket

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
because that'll snag on your pocket

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.110 
because that'll snag on your pocket
easier<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.620> don't<00:02:27.770> want<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.070> angle<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.910> kind

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
easier you don't want that angle to kind

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.880 
easier you don't want that angle to kind
of<00:02:29.180> run<00:02:29.390> off<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.720> side<00:02:29.930> pocket<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.740> is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
of run off the side pocket so this is
