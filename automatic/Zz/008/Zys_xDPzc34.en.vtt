00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.460
 nice all the guys are je i give you the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.290
 welcome to this new video is not a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 episode of the raw your milan with sma un 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.360
 special video since I would like to show you 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.860
 as I do, in short, buy and sell 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 various methods 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 let's start right away from the first one I have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.760
 also shown in a couple of videos 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.130
 makes commented very simple or 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.439
 consists of looking for a silver player 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 from the premier league and with module 4 1 2 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:35.239
 with a maximum price of 350 bar at 400 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 credits is a fairly useful method 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.960
 obviously not necessarily 350 credits 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
 because it also depends on the players ad 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.989
 example this is pretty gross though 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 you can find players who still do 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.129
 they can sell quite well 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.030
 you could have good ones 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.699
 most likely occasions we say look for 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 players at auction because they could 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.440
 find just rare players or 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.040
 however stronger and more sellable like 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.860
 for example this player 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.080
 this especially bets a lot on 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.479
 players with exteriors for example 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.270
 right-sided left-handed much too 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.420
 on these players rare subtractions 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.799
 right-handed and fast claims 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 obviously you don't have to spend 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.930
 very much it is also very suicidal chips 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.220
 that there are few if I do n't call the list 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.689
 watch how you see this how 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.290
 they have already passed it so we leave it 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.299
 to stay 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.820
 in short, you have to do this with a bit of 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.380
 players obviously the auctions will be 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.090
 long enough but in the meantime you 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 you can do 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.810
 in other words, you can do other players 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.250
 let's say there are enough 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.730
 it must also go there a little luck in short 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.400
 why 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.770
 there are players who maybe one day 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.850
 can be worth enough and see 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.730
 this this 950 1100 if I take it to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.800
 300 uneven could be anyway already 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.930
 an excellent notes map example players 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.470
 like this one if you take it at 300 400 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.630
 how do you see the speed high enough 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.580
 because the module 4 1 2 because the module 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.170
 best selling is because the British are 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.600
 literally seasoning lovers of 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.050
 this form are fully set by 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.480
 this form so you could do a 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.600
 excellent sale 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280
 the second method is relatively similar 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.620
 just that you have to do the same thing with 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.660
 of gold players but you have to look for them 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.190
 maximum auction 300 always of the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.170
 premier league is always with this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.800
 module 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.500
 there are players who can sell 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.480
 quite how you are seeing these 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.430
 players especially for example 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.950
 players of important teams like cia 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.600
 brands that plays in the arsenal or 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.450
 this luca leiva as they just dictate 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.310
 offered an exaggerated price 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.610
 look at this the offer is in two 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.790
 pro was a pretty stupid thing 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.390
 I have to say this rosicky of arsenal 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.770
 so he could still sell now not 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.170
 I go on looking for players because 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.290
 I would not waste credits for now 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.200
 not even that long since I want 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.970
 dedicate myself to the builder shield 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.000
 the other method is to search 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.830
 gold players however any always ad 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.170
 a maximum price of 300 credits 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.959
 you will find many players especially 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.269
 with a real high those of 75 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.980
 let them have to use above all 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:43.010
 players with a real up 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:46.209
 advice from 78 upwards since they sell of 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.120
 no longer ask me why 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.819
 but also the players of a championship 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.500
 relatively that is, don't go and buy 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.769
 the league players can not 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.930
 see you could sell so 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.079
 450 I offer here is though quietly 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.030
 do not overbalance too obviously you do 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.650
 also offers for players and vi 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.640
 I recommend a lot of players from the series a 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 and then they go past them not to offer 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.220
 more there is a lot of luck too 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.579
 sure if more players succeeded 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.579
 take better is 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.380
 as we are now going to eder in the list 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.349
 for example, they have passed me 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.729
 have the ambient at 500 but not me 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.950
 I'm going to kill myself 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.389
 here I leave it there is not that how 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.070
 see all these players which 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:40.550
 we won and we put them up for auction 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.710
 at a relatively high price there 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.599
 you will earn a lot but there is always 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.300
 a minimum of buying and selling these methods 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.520
 complicated to start and you will memorize 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.970
 the less he passed I make the last offer 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.970
 at the last second and then leave it there 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.540
 in conclusion 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.010
 all our players for sale 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.570
 now I'm not putting them because I don't have 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.360
 a long time 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.390
 as you can see oh well I also used some 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.490
 silver player taken 150 as you see 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.810
 I exchange the stack full of players who 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.700
 use of the premier league 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.590
 silver of the same form to make 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.450
 Trade 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.000
 in short I have a total of 300,000 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:23.350
 credits 350,000 credits there is a team 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.880
 now from 120,000 credits of which 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 will make a scud builder i will do the 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.160
 practically in the second scott builder 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.160
 I think 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.980
 well that to say these are the methods that 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.110
 I use more than anything else that used to start 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.530
 then obviously everyone has to find 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.600
 players run to find their own 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.670
 players 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.550
 I tell you to make a sale 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.600
 this serves of 4 1 2 1 2 then yes 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.600
 can aim high 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.350
 that is, they need relatively players 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.900
 expensive that you can sell to a 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.850
 high price because if not really not 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.500
 it's worth it 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.270
 for example I used neymar and I have 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.540
 I took more or less 100 thousand 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.710
 credit something less with neymar 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.980
 see this ciamo even now not 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.900
 we can try to put at a price 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.310
 high enough for now I shouldn't 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.560
 go and look for its price 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.910
 its true price however sincerely 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.020
 now they do n't want to waste time 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.360
 however I recommend these methods 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.760
 especially the player's method 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.250
 silver of the premier league of 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.280
 take it low prices because it really 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.960
 you can get as much this as said 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.990
 there is a good speed nothing of what it is 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.220
 for goodness sake, however, you can safely 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.040
 double in a note and credits you 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.410
 buy 30 players like this at 500 li 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.510
 put it all to me it happened 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.590
 this is too high that is not to stand at 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:54.430
 spend additional credits and therefore 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.260
 guys for this video is all short 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.540
 will come new videos dedicated to 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:03.850
 shield builder we'll start with a 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:07.479
 bundesliga which is this 4 4 2 silver 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.340
 pretty expensive and I have just less idea 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.970
 all these here to get me 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.340
 in short another another team of which 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.979
 make a scoop builder well in short 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.860
 guys that 's all we see at a 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:23.470
 next video of the score with 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.360
 her will probably do other videos too 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.490
 in short, milian coins for 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.449
 let you see a few players from 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.449
 use beautiful
