even darker you don't want to start

even darker you don't want to start
blending<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.360> this<00:04:44.570> way<00:04:44.810> because<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.110> will

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
blending it this way because it will

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.260 
blending it this way because it will
actually<00:04:45.470> widen<00:04:46.370> your<00:04:46.400> face<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:46.970> make<00:04:47.120> your

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
face look bigger and fatter and it'll

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.670 
face look bigger and fatter and it'll
get<00:04:49.850> muddy<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:50.600> it's<00:04:50.900> very<00:04:51.020> important<00:04:51.500> just<00:04:51.590> to

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
get muddy so it's very important just to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.290 
get muddy so it's very important just to
keep<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.040> at<00:04:52.190> an<00:04:52.370> angle<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:52.940> where<00:04:53.120> you'll

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
keep it at an angle so where you'll

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.300 
keep it at an angle so where you'll
admit<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.690> one<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.870> your<00:04:53.990> eye<00:04:54.020> is<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:55.070> want<00:04:55.250> to

stop right there because if you go in

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.630 
stop right there because if you go in
too<00:04:57.110> deep<00:04:57.320> it'll<00:04:57.590> sort<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:57.860> dark<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.250> your<00:04:58.400> face
