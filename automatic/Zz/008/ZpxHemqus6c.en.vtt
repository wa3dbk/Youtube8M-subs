00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello and welcome to their landline 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.220
 tv my name is antoine your life I 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
 am a retoucher photographer in the region 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.760
 Parisian and today I'm going to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.000
 present my word from their favorite bowl 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.000
 beauty 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.140
 when it comes to photographs of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.160
 fashion or portraits the beauty bowl does 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 quickly his appearance 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.669
 this is a unique and very fashionable 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 particular that offers a light 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.630
 singular this light is at once 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 strong in order to bring out the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 details and homogeneous allowing to offer 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.449
 a uniform light without the appearance of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 hotspots this is the mode their ideal 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.110
 to highlight the texture of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.019
 skin or the details of a makeup by 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.400
 example the bowl is used with a flash 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.870
 or continuous light but can 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.940
 also be mounted on a cobra flash 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 thanks to an adapter like the daughter hs 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.420
 footix brand's request the result 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.149
 may be a little less uniform 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 but offers undeniable mobility 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.300
 consists of a wide and deep bowl to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.160
 inside which is a mini 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.539
 reflectors it's this mini reflectors 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 who will avoid the formation of points 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.730
 hot in the picture 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.309
 this mode they come in several 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 coating sizes and same shape the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.590
 standard size is 56 cm as here 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 but it also exists in 44 or even 41 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.500
 cm following the marks and again 70 80 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.479
 even 100 cm plus the diameter of the bowl is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 big plus diffusion is important 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 however, by increasing the size of the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.970
 time mode we risk losing the side 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 hard light concerning the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.200
 coating it comes mainly 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.729
 in white or in silver know that the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.770
 white provide a softer light than 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.210
 the silver coating the beauty bowl can 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.310
 to be used naked or with accessories 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.299
 for starters i will show you 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.100
 some configurations with the naked bowl 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.900
 approaching the bowl of the subject on 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.890
 increases the diffusion of light all 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.890
 by reducing drop shadows 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 and on the contrary by pulling back the bowl of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 face the diffusion is less important 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.409
 and the shadows are more pronounced 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.850
 if you photograph a favorite man 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770
 obola lighting near the face 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.900
 if instead you want to put in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.490
 value makeup of a woman back down 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.110
 the bowl slightly to accentuate the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.730
 shadows and marked a true 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.560
 contrast between the first elements of the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.540
 face touched by light like the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.890
 eyes and lips and plunge into the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.989
 black as cost and temples 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.540
 moreover this will accentuate the effect of 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.830
 depth in the image attention them 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.569
 beauty bowls tend to accentuate 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.400
 some facial details like 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.870
 wrinkles and small imperfections a 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.420
 post treatment work will then be 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.100
 necessary to reduce its effects for 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.720
 mitigate these details and get a 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.340
 softer result you can 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.850
 replace the beauty bowl with a box 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.850
 light for example 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.989
 to obtain a broadcast area could 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.280
 squeeze without having to move the bowl and 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.319
 change the structure of drop shadows 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.269
 there is an accessory that I judge 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.069
 essential grid honeycomb 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.260
 this grid is composed of a multitude 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.230
 to raise the hall and comes to fix the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.239
 sale of the beauty bowl these small alveoli 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.280
 beveled prevents the spread of 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 light beyond a given angle with the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.540
 grid here it's a grid of 40 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.969
 degrees but there are 20 or 30 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.530
 for example to reduce even more 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.389
 the diffusion of light is a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.719
 perfect modeler to isolate the subject of 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.719
 its environment 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.609
 conversely it is possible to use a 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.199
 fabric diffusers like this one its purpose 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.400
 is to increase the diffusion of the bowl 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.569
 when it is not possible 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.569
 last more of the subject 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.860
 last little tip when I 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.540
 photo shoots I mostly use 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.550
 the beauty bowl in main light 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.200
 however it can also serve as 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.970
 secondary light when a box 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.650
 light is used in main source 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.599
 to give a bit of contrast and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.230
 volume in the light this accessory is 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.819
 quite expensive 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.280
 however some brands like 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.380
 linkstar or falco nice offers prices 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.880
 affordable to offer more 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.709
 flexibility of movement 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.989
 builders have recently developed a 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.310
 collapsible beauty bowl this one is very 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.630
 simple assembly is relatively 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.700
 close to the original beauty bowl 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.170
 it offers a good alternative to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.060
 followers of the movement straub is by 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.489
 example the only downside is in its form 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
 octagonal that do not offer a reflection 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.660
 totally round in the eyes of the model 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.700
 the famous catch light is this 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.380
 show is now over I want 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.150
