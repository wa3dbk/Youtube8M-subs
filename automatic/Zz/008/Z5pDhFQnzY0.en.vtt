that but yeah so you know definitely a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.419 
that but yeah so you know definitely a
difference<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:04.439> RPM<00:02:05.450> rear<00:02:06.450> bumper<00:02:06.869> with

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429

the RPM mud flaps

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.830 
the RPM mud flaps
which<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.989> see<00:02:15.019> right<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:17.810> are

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
which you can see right there they are

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 
which you can see right there they are
it's<00:02:18.349> like<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.500> soft<00:02:18.799> material<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:20.420> right<00:02:20.569> um

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
it's like a soft material all right um

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.320 
it's like a soft material all right um
the<00:02:21.349> only<00:02:21.560> thing<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.069> like<00:02:22.549> these<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> lot<00:02:22.849> feed

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the only thing I like these a lot feed

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.110 
the only thing I like these a lot feed
they're<00:02:23.659> really<00:02:23.989> nice<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:25.549> only<00:02:25.790> thing<00:02:26.000> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
they're really nice the only thing I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.680 
they're really nice the only thing I
wish<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.750> they<00:02:27.409> came<00:02:27.769> out<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.420> little<00:02:29.420> bit

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
wish that they came out a little bit

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.559 
wish that they came out a little bit
further<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.410> little<00:02:30.980> bit<00:02:31.370> further<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.450> know

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
further a little bit further so you know

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.160 
further a little bit further so you know
it<00:02:33.019> would<00:02:33.140> cover<00:02:33.410> most<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.370> wheel<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:35.629> guess<00:02:35.989> if

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
it would cover most the wheel I guess if

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.839 
it would cover most the wheel I guess if
you<00:02:36.260> really<00:02:36.290> wanted<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> could<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:37.580> know

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
you really wanted to you could you know

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.009 
you really wanted to you could you know
you<00:02:37.940> could<00:02:38.090> probably<00:02:38.239> get<00:02:38.510> some<00:02:38.750> plastic

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
you could probably get some plastic

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.449 
you could probably get some plastic
spacers<00:02:39.709> because<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.610> how<00:02:40.700> they<00:02:40.849> bolt<00:02:41.090> on

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.330 

all<00:02:46.459> right<00:02:46.670> there<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.269> go<00:02:47.620> t<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.829> they<00:02:49.069> bolt

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
all right there you go t just they bolt

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.880 
all right there you go t just they bolt
on<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.780> frame<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.560> of

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
on to the to like the frame of the of

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.979 
on to the to like the frame of the of
the<00:02:52.010> bumper<00:02:52.250> there's<00:02:53.000> just<00:02:53.090> one<00:02:53.239> screw<00:02:53.720> there

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
the bumper there's just one screw there

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.979 
the bumper there's just one screw there
and<00:02:54.230> then<00:02:54.440> one<00:02:54.560> screw<00:02:54.920> right<00:02:55.340> there<00:02:55.870> that's<00:02:56.870> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
and then one screw right there that's it

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.240 
and then one screw right there that's it
so<00:02:57.109> you<00:02:57.170> could<00:02:57.260> probably<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.620> some<00:02:57.739> spacers

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
so you could probably get some spacers

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.509 
so you could probably get some spacers
and<00:02:58.519> get<00:02:59.420> some<00:02:59.569> longer<00:02:59.870> screws<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.519> it'll

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
and get some longer screws and it'll

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.430 
and get some longer screws and it'll
come<00:03:01.910> out<00:03:02.030> further<00:03:02.269> but<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.079> bad<00:03:03.260> it's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
come out further but it's not bad it's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.869 
come out further but it's not bad it's
cool<00:03:03.680> i<00:03:03.859> like<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:07.299> so<00:03:08.299> yeah<00:03:09.220> that's<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.640> think

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
cool i like it so so yeah that's I think

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.920 
cool i like it so so yeah that's I think
that's<00:03:11.000> everything<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.299> did<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:11.720> for<00:03:11.900> now

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
that's everything I did to it for now

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.259 
that's everything I did to it for now
like<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.799> said<00:03:13.090> pretty<00:03:14.090> soon<00:03:14.359> it'll<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:16.269> RPM

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
like I said pretty soon it'll be the RPM

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.629 
like I said pretty soon it'll be the RPM
hey<00:03:17.989> arms<00:03:18.349> front<00:03:18.889> rears<00:03:19.660> keeping<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.750> black

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
hey arms front rears keeping that black

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.599 
hey arms front rears keeping that black
most<00:03:22.639> likely<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.599> center<00:03:23.870> diff<00:03:24.340> there<00:03:25.340> to

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
most likely the the center diff there to

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.430 
most likely the the center diff there to
distribute<00:03:26.090> even<00:03:26.810> power<00:03:27.019> throughout<00:03:27.349> the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
distribute even power throughout the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.970 
distribute even power throughout the
wheels<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.630> I'll<00:03:29.630> definitely<00:03:29.870> buy<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
wheels and I'll definitely buy the the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.699 
wheels and I'll definitely buy the the
front<00:03:31.280> front<00:03:32.090> bumper<00:03:32.450> from<00:03:32.780> RPM<00:03:33.200> definitely

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
front front bumper from RPM definitely

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.250 
front front bumper from RPM definitely
need<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:35.859> yeah<00:03:36.859> but<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.639> said<00:03:37.700> I'm

batteries I have the energizer
rechargeable<00:03:46.160> batteries<00:03:46.910> which<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:48.410> know<00:03:48.530> I

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
rechargeable batteries which you know I

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.400 
rechargeable batteries which you know I
suppose<00:03:50.209> there<00:03:50.419> are<00:03:50.780> obviously<00:03:51.200> good

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
suppose there are obviously good

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.819 
suppose there are obviously good
batteries<00:03:51.799> but<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.010> go<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.250> plug<00:03:52.579> them<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.849> and

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829
