now here's what I think
Oswald<00:03:10.600> does<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.080> thirteen

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
Oswald does one of the thirteen

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.900 
Oswald does one of the thirteen
darknesses<00:03:11.530> would<00:03:12.100> be<00:03:12.220> pretty<00:03:12.460> obvious<00:03:12.610> you

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
darknesses would be pretty obvious you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.160 
darknesses would be pretty obvious you
could<00:03:13.030> pretty<00:03:13.180> much<00:03:13.270> tell<00:03:13.570> that<00:03:13.840> he's<00:03:13.990> under

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
could pretty much tell that he's under

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.980 
could pretty much tell that he's under
that<00:03:14.350> robe<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:16.570> wouldn't<00:03:16.750> mix

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
that robe and it just wouldn't mix

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.950 
that robe and it just wouldn't mix
together<00:03:17.380> with<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.890> other<00:03:18.570> with<00:03:19.570> other<00:03:19.690> 12

together with the other with other 12
organization<00:03:20.500> members<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.800> would<00:03:20.860> just<00:03:20.980> make

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
organization members I would just make

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.040 
organization members I would just make
no<00:03:21.280> sense<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.610> very<00:03:21.790> weird<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.270> couldn't<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.930> see

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
no sense be very weird I couldn't I see

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.600 
no sense be very weird I couldn't I see
a<00:03:23.110> rabbit<00:03:23.350> working<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.160> bunch<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.520> other

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
because as you guys can assume or know

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.750 
because as you guys can assume or know
pretty<00:03:32.140> much<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.130> were<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.310> match<00:03:33.490> up

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
pretty much if you were to match up

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.070 
pretty much if you were to match up
pretty<00:03:34.150> much<00:03:34.240> it's<00:03:34.510> kind<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.690> weird<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:34.960> if

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
pretty much it's kind of weird but if

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.420 
pretty much it's kind of weird but if
you<00:03:35.140> were<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.320> match<00:03:35.470> up<00:03:35.710> like<00:03:35.890> whose<00:03:36.070> main

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
you were to match up like whose main

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.510 
you were to match up like whose main
rival<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:38.320> CHEM<00:03:38.620> hearts<00:03:38.830> like<00:03:38.980> Sora's<00:03:39.340> main

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
rival in CHEM hearts like Sora's main

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.820 
rival in CHEM hearts like Sora's main
rival<00:03:39.850> pretty<00:03:40.030> much<00:03:40.150> as<00:03:40.270> M<00:03:40.450> Ness<00:03:40.660> riku's<00:03:41.620> main

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
rival pretty much as M Ness riku's main

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.630 
rival pretty much as M Ness riku's main
rival<00:03:42.250> would<00:03:42.700> be<00:03:43.090> considered<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.780> some<00:03:43.990> I

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
rival would be considered and some I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.520 
rival would be considered and some I
would<00:03:45.640> say<00:03:45.880> aquas<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.930> can't<00:03:47.320> really<00:03:47.440> think

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
would say aquas I can't really think

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.990 
would say aquas I can't really think
vaak<00:03:47.800> was<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.130> then<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:48.370> would<00:03:48.520> be<00:03:48.610> venetus

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
vaak was but then this would be venetus

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.750 
vaak was but then this would be venetus
and<00:03:49.270> taro<00:03:49.780> would<00:03:49.960> be<00:03:50.050> saying<00:03:50.320> or<00:03:50.470> maybe<00:03:50.760> aqua

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and taro would be saying or maybe aqua

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.480 
and taro would be saying or maybe aqua

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
I think that making either one in

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.430 
I think that making either one in
Mickey's<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.430> would<00:03:57.850> say<00:03:58.090> would<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.660> could<00:03:59.410> be

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
Mickey's I would say would be could be

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.050 
Mickey's I would say would be could be
Oswald<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.459> would<00:04:00.550> be<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.670> secret<00:04:00.880> boss

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
Oswald and that would be a secret boss

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.830 
Oswald and that would be a secret boss
battle<00:04:01.330> it'd<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.480> fun

battle it'd be fun

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.570 
battle it'd be fun

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
arts 3d dream Drop Distance and I think

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.380

the<00:04:05.770> Oswald<00:04:06.190> could<00:04:06.310> be<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> good<00:04:06.610> fight<00:04:06.850> maybe

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
he could wield a keyblade I think he

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.770 
he could wield a keyblade I think he
probably<00:04:09.190> could<00:04:09.520> if<00:04:09.700> not<00:04:10.270> that<00:04:10.540> maybe<00:04:10.660> he

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
probably could if not that maybe he

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.060 
probably could if not that maybe he
could<00:04:10.900> be<00:04:10.930> something<00:04:11.350> else<00:04:11.440> but<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.650> think<00:04:11.950> oz

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
could be something else but I think oz

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.430 
could be something else but I think oz

takes<00:04:45.169> over<00:04:45.469> and<00:04:45.680> if<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.250> could<00:04:46.460> be<00:04:46.490> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
takes over and if so that could be the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.670 
takes over and if so that could be the
new<00:04:47.240> battle<00:04:47.689> that<00:04:47.870> we<00:04:47.960> have<00:04:48.139> in<00:04:48.289> Kingdom<00:04:48.500> arts

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
new battle that we have in Kingdom arts

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.050 
new battle that we have in Kingdom arts
for<00:04:48.919> what<00:04:49.129> we<00:04:49.219> have<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.460> stop<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.849> darkness

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
for what we have to stop the darkness

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.270 
for what we have to stop the darkness
but<00:04:50.689> maybe<00:04:51.139> instead<00:04:51.439> there's<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.770> new<00:04:51.949> enemy

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
but maybe instead there's a new enemy

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.740 
but maybe instead there's a new enemy
hasn't<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.580> new<00:04:52.699> person<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.150> new<00:04:53.270> being<00:04:53.449> that<00:04:53.539> we

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
hasn't a new person a new being that we

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.540 
hasn't a new person a new being that we
have<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.960> fight<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.710> could<00:04:54.919> be<00:04:55.039> part<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.490> the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
have to fight that could be part of the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.920 
have to fight that could be part of the
next<00:04:55.849> Kingdom<00:04:56.120> Hearts<00:04:56.240> series<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:56.689> don't<00:04:56.840> know

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
next Kingdom Hearts series we don't know

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.909 
next Kingdom Hearts series we don't know
that<00:04:57.080> maybe<00:04:57.319> there<00:04:57.439> could<00:04:57.500> be<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.650> new<00:04:57.770> person

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
that maybe there could be a new person

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.350 
that maybe there could be a new person
or<00:04:58.219> maybe<00:04:58.430> they'd<00:04:58.580> just<00:04:58.699> be<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:58.879> swords<00:04:59.210> fight

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
or maybe they'd just be a swords fight

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.969 
or maybe they'd just be a swords fight
against<00:04:59.599> the<00:04:59.689> darkness<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.409> take<00:05:00.590> back<00:05:00.800> the

hopefully you guys can understand that I

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.570 
hopefully you guys can understand that I
really<00:05:34.669> hope<00:05:34.819> that<00:05:34.849> this<00:05:35.090> is<00:05:35.770> possible<00:05:36.770> now

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
really hope that this is possible now

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
really hope that this is possible now
you<00:05:37.639> guys<00:05:37.849> might<00:05:38.120> understand<00:05:38.569> why<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:38.870> is

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
you guys might understand why this is

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.170 
you guys might understand why this is
number<00:05:39.199> two<00:05:39.440> might<00:05:39.800> not<00:05:39.979> but<00:05:40.279> either<00:05:40.550> way<00:05:40.789> I'm

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
number two might not but either way I'm

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.580 
number two might not but either way I'm
hopping<00:05:41.539> in<00:05:41.629> number<00:05:41.870> one<00:05:41.990> because<00:05:42.169> I<00:05:42.319> think

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
hopping in number one because I think

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.570 
hopping in number one because I think
number<00:05:42.710> one<00:05:42.889> would<00:05:42.979> be<00:05:43.009> the<00:05:43.069> best<00:05:43.159> bet<00:05:43.460> and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
number one would be the best bet and

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.189 
number one would be the best bet and
yeah<00:05:44.210> let's<00:05:44.449> go<00:05:44.539> on<00:05:44.569> to<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.779> next<00:05:44.870> one<00:05:45.020> which

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
yeah let's go on to the next one which

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:54.020 
yeah let's go on to the next one which
is<00:05:45.379> number<00:05:45.650> one

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.340 

now<00:05:55.030> number<00:05:55.450> one<00:05:55.480> I<00:05:55.690> think<00:05:56.139> could<00:05:56.260> be<00:05:56.290> a

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
now number one I think could be a

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.560 
now number one I think could be a
perfect<00:05:56.950> boss<00:05:57.220> and<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:58.000> boss<00:05:58.240> would<00:05:58.540> be

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
perfect boss and that boss would be

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.659 
perfect boss and that boss would be
Gilgamesh<00:05:59.350> now<00:05:59.889> I<00:06:00.130> don't<00:06:00.370> know<00:06:00.460> much<00:06:00.639> about
