00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
that's time to get a new one

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.630 
that's time to get a new one
so<00:01:55.670> cracks<00:01:56.000> can<00:01:56.390> irritate<00:01:56.720> your<00:01:57.020> skin<00:01:57.340> also<00:01:58.340> if

you notice any skin rash then that

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.410 
you notice any skin rash then that
probably<00:02:01.280> means<00:02:01.490> there's<00:02:01.729> some<00:02:01.880> bacterial

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
probably means there's some bacterial

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.719 
probably means there's some bacterial
growth<00:02:02.659> in<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.200> liner<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.310> probably

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
growth in the liner and you probably

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.359 
growth in the liner and you probably
have<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.090> get<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.239> new<00:02:05.420> liner<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:10.160> that

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.230 
have to get a new liner so that
completes<00:02:10.759> how<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.239> wash<00:02:11.569> your<00:02:11.780> gel<00:02:11.959> liner
