heroes of the storm if you want to take
kerrigan<00:01:17.880> wings<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.320> really

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
kerrigan wings and this is really really

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
kerrigan wings and this is really really
cool<00:01:19.950> enough<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.750> decide<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> give<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
cool enough that they decide to give it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
cool enough that they decide to give it
everyone<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.920> free<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.670> downside<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
have to pre on it but I think it's gonna

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
have to pre on it but I think it's gonna
be<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> good<00:01:26.490> game<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.759> even<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:28.140> people

possibly look um this year's imperious
the<00:02:08.310> angel<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:10.050> idea<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the angel and it's my idea is that the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
the angel and it's my idea is that the
wings<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.760> something

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
along those lines now it's not an

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.280 
along those lines now it's not an

personal impression of the name

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.240 
personal impression of the name
imperious<00:02:19.080> wings<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.530> kept<00:02:19.740> Ben<00:02:19.950> Tate<00:02:20.130> the

man and showing Imperials himself this
definitely<00:02:23.070> looks<00:02:23.430> better<00:02:23.640> than<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.120> any

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300

the best but now but compared to this I
don't<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:30.240> choose<00:02:30.720> anything<00:02:31.050> over

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
