00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.280
 but for questions our girls have a lot 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.700
 questions our boys 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:18.620
 we would tell you to show you what 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:22.040
 reading a book we study together 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:26.480
 why is it dark at night 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:30.650
 Masha, good evening, Adrian 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.650
 aurica at night in the evening 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.140
 tell me it seems 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.580
 Of course I will tell you and I live on 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.660
 big planet 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.110
 you know what it's called of course 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.610
 Of course the land is far away from us and from 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.680
 our planet has a huge bright star 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 the sun 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.470
 the sun shines on the earth and from this on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.910
 the earth is light but the sun illuminates only 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.850
 one side of the earth 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.270
 and the other side of the earth is not nonsense 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.660
 illuminated there dark there night the earth is the earth all 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.310
 time rotates around its axis 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 imaginary axis and all the time 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.869
 turns to the sun different 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 by the parties 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.270
 look let's imagine that now 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.200
 the earth is turned so that the sun illuminates 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 our second city of Moscow is land 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.110
 a little bit of light will turn 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.630
 less evening will begin to get dark 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.280
 in our city 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 then the earth will turn even stronger 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.119
 night comes and then the earth again 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.720
 Moscow will develop services and come 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.500
 the day is the time for which the earth does 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.020
 one full turn around its axis 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.560
 called the day in days 24 hours 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.750
 you have time to wake up during this time 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.140
 breakfast go to kindergarten back 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.960
 home play walk dine lie down 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.760
 sleep wake up again and the earth does 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:20.340
 one full turn understood well of course 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.910
 when our brain can think of maybe 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.430
 thinner it here for example in Moscow 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:33.130
 evening in New York in the morning in London the day 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.680
