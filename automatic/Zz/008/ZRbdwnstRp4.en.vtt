also guys Chris from Andrew comm taking
a<00:00:02.460> quick<00:00:02.669> look<00:00:02.850> at<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.090> fingers<00:00:03.570> scanning

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
a quick look at the fingers scanning

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.110 
a quick look at the fingers scanning
technology<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.190> galaxy<00:00:05.549> s6<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
technology on the galaxy s6 and the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.940 
technology on the galaxy s6 and the
galaxy<00:00:06.330> s5<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.890> let's<00:00:08.099> start<00:00:08.309> with<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.760> s6<00:00:09.330> now

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
galaxy s5 so let's start with the s6 now

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.280 
galaxy s5 so let's start with the s6 now
same<00:00:10.950> as<00:00:11.190> with<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.670> s5<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.450> finger<00:00:13.049> scanner

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
same as with the s5 the finger scanner

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.350 
same as with the s5 the finger scanner
is<00:00:13.500> located<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.070> home<00:00:14.219> button<00:00:14.490> but<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
is located in the home button but on the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.130 
is located in the home button but on the
s5<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.800> swipe<00:00:17.369> gesture<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.210> s6<00:00:18.330> it's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
s5 it was a swipe gesture on the s6 it's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.490 
s5 it was a swipe gesture on the s6 it's
a<00:00:19.439> touch<00:00:19.920> based<00:00:20.330> sensor<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.080> actually

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a touch based sensor so it's actually

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
a touch based sensor so it's actually
much<00:00:22.740> more<00:00:22.920> convenient<00:00:23.400> because<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.699> don't

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
much more convenient because you don't

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.599 
much more convenient because you don't
have<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.390> remove<00:00:24.900> your<00:00:25.800> finger<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.279> have

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
have to remove your finger you just have

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.710 
have to remove your finger you just have
to<00:00:26.699> press<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> button<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to press the button and that's it you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080 
to press the button and that's it you
don't<00:00:27.840> depress<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.680> swipe<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.760> go

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
don't depress it and then swipe so go

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.350 
don't depress it and then swipe so go
into<00:00:30.390> your<00:00:30.510> lock<00:00:30.779> screen<00:00:30.810> options<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
into your lock screen options and

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.250 
into your lock screen options and
obviously<00:00:33.360> you'll<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> quick<00:00:33.960> disclaimer

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
obviously you'll have a quick disclaimer

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.780 
obviously you'll have a quick disclaimer
to<00:00:34.590> let<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> know<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> store

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to let you know that you need to store

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.630 
to let you know that you need to store
your<00:00:36.059> fingerprint<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> device<00:00:37.200> itself

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
your fingerprint on the device itself

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.940 
your fingerprint on the device itself
but<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.940> mechanism<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:39.930> recording<00:00:40.800> your

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
but the mechanism for recording your

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.889 
but the mechanism for recording your
fingers<00:00:41.399> fingerprint<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> little

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
fingers fingerprint is actually a little

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
fingers fingerprint is actually a little
bit<00:00:43.020> different<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.129> touch<00:00:44.340> based

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
bit different because it's touch based

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.850 
bit different because it's touch based
you<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> continually<00:00:45.870> touch<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you just have to continually touch the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.069 
you just have to continually touch the
home<00:00:47.250> button<00:00:47.280> until<00:00:48.149> enough<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:48.750> finger

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
home button until enough of your finger

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
home button until enough of your finger
is<00:00:49.230> registered<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.010> we'll<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.149> from

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is registered now we'll do this in from

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
is registered now we'll do this in from
our<00:00:51.480> real<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.680> see

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
our real time for you so you can see

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
our real time for you so you can see
just<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:53.129> long<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> takes<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.239> long<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just how long it takes not very long but

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
just how long it takes not very long but
you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.350> probably<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.520> idea<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
you can probably get an idea that you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
you can probably get an idea that you
feel<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.230> starting<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> run<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
feel like you're starting to run out of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
feel like you're starting to run out of
fingerprint<00:01:00.109> for<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> s6<00:01:02.160> actually

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
fingerprint for what the s6 actually

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
fingerprint for what the s6 actually
wants<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> record<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> little

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
wants you to record now this is a little

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.230 
wants you to record now this is a little
weird<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.129> you're<00:01:05.280> recording<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
weird when you're recording because it's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840 
weird when you're recording because it's
not<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.540> easy<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.860> SX<00:01:08.189> satisfied

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
not so easy to to make the SX satisfied

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.010 
not so easy to to make the SX satisfied
with<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.090> much<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.510> fingerprint<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
with how much of your fingerprint is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.230 
with how much of your fingerprint is
being<00:01:10.560> stored<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> does<00:01:11.430> mean<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
being stored but it does mean that the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
being stored but it does mean that the
sensor<00:01:13.110> will<00:01:13.260> actually<00:01:13.530> work<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> wide

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
sensor will actually work in a wide

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
sensor will actually work in a wide
range<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> different<00:01:15.170> situations<00:01:16.170> depending

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
range of different situations depending

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.749 
range of different situations depending
on<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:16.830> way<00:01:16.979> you're<00:01:17.130> holding<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> phone

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
on which way you're holding the phone

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.190 
on which way you're holding the phone
and<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.150> part<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.600> finger<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.960> press

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and which part of your finger you press

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
and which part of your finger you press
so<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> useful<00:01:20.240> so

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so it's actually kind of useful so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820 
so it's actually kind of useful so
that's<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.689> once<00:01:22.560> you've<00:01:22.680> done<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that's it there once you've done that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
that's it there once you've done that
you<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.220> enter<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> backup<00:01:24.119> password<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you just enter in a backup password of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.740 
you just enter in a backup password of
course<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.590> real<00:01:25.770> good<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> make<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:27.030> your

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
course some real good and make sure your

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.120 
course some real good and make sure your
lock<00:01:28.049> screen<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.290> set<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.740> fingerprint

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
lock screen is set to your fingerprint

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.350 
lock screen is set to your fingerprint
and<00:01:29.509> then<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.689> turn<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.880> maybe<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.970> took<00:01:33.060> my

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and then we go turn on maybe I took my

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.929 
and then we go turn on maybe I took my
finger<00:01:33.420> off<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.110> quick<00:01:34.350> yeah<00:01:35.189> let's<00:01:35.610> do

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
finger off a bit too quick yeah let's do

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.289 
finger off a bit too quick yeah let's do
that<00:01:36.150> again

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
that again

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
that again
ok<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.360> press<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> once<00:01:40.560> let<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> re<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.970> we

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
ok so press it once let it re there we

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.560 
ok so press it once let it re there we
go<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.810> second<00:01:43.799> try<00:01:43.950> works<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.180> try<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
go so second try works well so try it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.859 
go so second try works well so try it
again<00:01:45.710> press<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.790> that's<00:01:48.000> yep<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.689> pretty

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
again press and that's yep that's pretty

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.460 
again press and that's yep that's pretty
quick<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:50.119> have<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> say<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.200> like

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
quick so I have to say I do really like

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
quick so I have to say I do really like
the<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.009> handled<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.850> s6<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.780> s5

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the way it's handled on the s6 the s5

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139 
the way it's handled on the s6 the s5
with<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> swipe<00:01:56.070> based<00:01:56.310> gesture<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.969> see

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
with the swipe based gesture you can see

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.359 
with the swipe based gesture you can see
here<00:01:57.560> obviously<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> lot<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> comes<00:01:59.159> down<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
here obviously a lot of it comes down to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550 
here obviously a lot of it comes down to
the<00:01:59.670> way<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.750> hold<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> phone

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the way that you actually hold the phone

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.609 
the way that you actually hold the phone
so<00:02:01.920> maybe<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.909> record<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.719> finger<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.259> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so maybe you record your finger in this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.749 
so maybe you record your finger in this
direction<00:02:04.799> which<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.399> little<00:02:05.640> bit

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
direction which is a little bit

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.350 
direction which is a little bit
unnatural

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
unnatural

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.370 
unnatural
compared<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.840> way<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:07.960> might<00:02:08.229> actually

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
compared to the way you might actually

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.840 
compared to the way you might actually
try<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.740> swipe<00:02:09.070> your<00:02:09.250> finger<00:02:09.369> when<00:02:09.700> you're

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
try to swipe your finger when you're

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.700 
try to swipe your finger when you're
actually<00:02:10.030> using<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.470> kind<00:02:11.680> of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
actually using it so it's kind of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.380 
actually using it so it's kind of
important<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.190> hold<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> find<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.060> way<00:02:13.180> that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
important to hold the find the way that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
important to hold the find the way that
you<00:02:13.510> would<00:02:13.810> actually<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:14.380> unlocking<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.280> when

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
you would actually be unlocking it when

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.340 
you would actually be unlocking it when
you're<00:02:15.610> recording<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.180> fingerprint<00:02:16.720> so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you're recording your fingerprint so

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.450 
you're recording your fingerprint so
it's<00:02:17.530> same<00:02:17.650> deal<00:02:17.830> once<00:02:18.100> you've<00:02:18.250> gone<00:02:18.400> through

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
it's same deal once you've gone through

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.700 
it's same deal once you've gone through
and<00:02:18.910> recorded<00:02:19.480> your<00:02:19.780> fingerprint<00:02:20.500> with<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
and recorded your fingerprint with the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.450 
and recorded your fingerprint with the
swipe<00:02:20.950> gesture<00:02:21.190> add<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.710> password<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.920> set

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
swipe gesture add in a password and set

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.460 
swipe gesture add in a password and set
your<00:02:24.610> lock<00:02:24.850> screen<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> fingerprint

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
your lock screen to a fingerprint

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.100 
your lock screen to a fingerprint
so<00:02:26.710> it'll<00:02:26.830> turn<00:02:27.010> off<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.520> press<00:02:28.510> once<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
so it'll turn off and press once and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.960 
so it'll turn off and press once and
then<00:02:29.650> swipe<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:31.360> nothing<00:02:31.750> off<00:02:31.950> okay<00:02:32.980> second

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
then swipe like nothing off okay second

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.400 
then swipe like nothing off okay second
try<00:02:34.120> okay<00:02:34.780> let's<00:02:34.959> do<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.110> again

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
try okay let's do it again

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.470 
try okay let's do it again
so<00:02:36.070> again<00:02:36.280> press<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.670> button<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.150> wake<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
so again press the button to wake the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.250 
so again press the button to wake the
screen<00:02:37.750> swipe<00:02:38.380> there<00:02:38.890> we<00:02:38.980> go<00:02:39.100> one<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:39.790> time

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
screen swipe there we go one more time

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.470 
screen swipe there we go one more time
and<00:02:41.260> as<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.340> can<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.730> works<00:02:42.940> pretty<00:02:43.360> much

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
and as you can see it works pretty much

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360 
and as you can see it works pretty much
just<00:02:43.810> as<00:02:43.959> reliably<00:02:44.470> -<00:02:44.770> maybe<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.040> little<00:02:45.070> bit

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
just as reliably - maybe a little bit

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.120 
just as reliably - maybe a little bit
more<00:02:45.760> awkward<00:02:45.970> than<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.080> s6<00:02:47.230> not<00:02:47.830> entirely

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
more awkward than the s6 not entirely

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.070 
more awkward than the s6 not entirely
sure<00:02:48.250> if<00:02:48.489> that's<00:02:48.730> why<00:02:48.940> Samsung<00:02:49.330> decided<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.959> go

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
sure if that's why Samsung decided to go

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660 
sure if that's why Samsung decided to go
from<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.380> swipe<00:02:50.590> based<00:02:50.830> gesture<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> touch

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
from a swipe based gesture to a touch

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.250 
from a swipe based gesture to a touch
based<00:02:51.940> sensor<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> definitely<00:02:52.840> works

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
based sensor but it definitely works

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.590 
based sensor but it definitely works
better<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.739> think<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.250> think<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.330> smaller

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
better I think I think the the smaller

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.540 
better I think I think the the smaller
dimensions<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> s6<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.370> little

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
dimensions of the s6 and it's a little

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.949 
dimensions of the s6 and it's a little
bit<00:02:57.670> slippery<00:02:57.970> as<00:02:58.150> well<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:58.810> probably

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
bit slippery as well it's probably

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.690 
bit slippery as well it's probably
better<00:02:59.260> not<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.709> holding<00:03:00.100> on<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.640> a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
better not to be holding on to that in a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.250 
better not to be holding on to that in a
kind<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.940> awkward<00:03:01.270> way<00:03:01.450> trying<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.050> this

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
kind of awkward way trying to do this

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.810 
kind of awkward way trying to do this
swipe<00:03:02.709> based<00:03:02.950> thing<00:03:03.130> so<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.280> think<00:03:03.370> touch<00:03:03.610> base

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
swipe based thing so I think touch base

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.790 
swipe based thing so I think touch base
is<00:03:04.000> much<00:03:04.239> better<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.080> long<00:03:05.200> run<00:03:05.320> but<00:03:05.590> let<00:03:05.770> us

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
is much better in a long run but let us

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.720 
is much better in a long run but let us
know<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.010> comments<00:03:06.340> which<00:03:06.430> one<00:03:06.489> you

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
know in the comments which one you

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.880 
know in the comments which one you
prefer
