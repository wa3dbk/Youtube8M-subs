00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.070 
start in this corner and it's going to
be<00:02:05.720> pretty<00:02:06.110> much<00:02:06.260> like<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.010> do<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.189> triangle

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
out but this is a triangular area that's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.069 
out but this is a triangular area that's
going<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.579> highlight<00:02:25.879> already<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:26.719> can<00:02:26.900> see
