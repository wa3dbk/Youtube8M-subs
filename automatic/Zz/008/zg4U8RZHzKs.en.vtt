though<00:01:49.090> come<00:01:49.960> on<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.680> got<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:50.830> step<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.370> guy

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
though come on you got to step this guy

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.460 
though come on you got to step this guy
before<00:01:51.700> he<00:01:51.970> really<00:01:52.210> gets<00:01:52.390> going<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.960> don't

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
before he really gets going I don't

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.080 
before he really gets going I don't
think<00:01:53.650> that's<00:01:53.800> gonna<00:01:53.950> happen<00:01:54.160> King<00:01:54.520> he's

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
think that's gonna happen King he's

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.310 
think that's gonna happen King he's
built<00:01:55.330> up<00:01:55.480> too<00:01:55.750> much

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
built up too much

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.670 
built up too much
we<00:01:56.770> stop<00:01:57.040> now<00:01:57.280> oh<00:01:57.610> boy<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.990> adrenaline<00:01:59.530> is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.290 
we stop now oh boy the adrenaline is
pumping<00:01:59.710> I<00:02:00.310> think<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.880> could<00:02:01.030> be<00:02:01.090> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
pumping I think this could be the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.700 
pumping I think this could be the
beginning<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> end

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
beginning of the end

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.110 
beginning of the end
here<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:03.310> go<00:02:04.979> continue<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.190> match<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.729> don't

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
here we go continue in the match I don't

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.010 
here we go continue in the match I don't
think<00:02:07.330> he's<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.630> any<00:02:07.900> her

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
think he's in any her

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.870 
think he's in any her
and<00:02:10.290> I<00:02:10.410> don't<00:02:10.470> think<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:10.860> press<00:02:11.100> wants<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and I don't think the press wants it to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.450 
and I don't think the press wants it to
end<00:02:11.910> easier<00:02:12.570> yeah<00:02:13.080> somebody<00:02:13.890> better<00:02:14.100> put<00:02:14.340> out
