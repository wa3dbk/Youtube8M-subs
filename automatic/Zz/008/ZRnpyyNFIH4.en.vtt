00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.520
 and 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.570
 hello youtube guys and girls like 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.760
 I hope you are very good 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.570
 If I'm fine and I bring you a new 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 good video in this video we're going to like 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 He says 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.559
 the description or title rather of the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.769
 video we are going to increase the memory of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.899
 our phone in this case the review 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.269
 from one this procedure can be 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.160
 do with any cell phone that 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.680
 you want the only thing they need 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.650
 Root test and the root program 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.269
 explorer could do it with any 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.120
 another file explorer but the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.970
 difference is that your explorer allows you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 be in the folder here and in the folder 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.420
 in the other folders that you are going to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 use 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.750
 so I mean 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 allows you to be in all your 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.280
 and your storage folders 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.700
 system 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.700
 well first of all they have to come down 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.369
 here we are going to give the best so that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 you guys are holding on 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.060
 let's find today is in the folder what 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.759
 I feel good here is the root 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.049
 this is the root folder that is where 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.479
 should appear and the folder 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.750
 storage radio storage 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.820
 ssd card as it says there and the root is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.070
 the root folder is all it has 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
 about our phone with which 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 our phone works good we're going to 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.670
 go to the bottom and we will go up and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.670
 go up and go up tantito tantito 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.100
 or they can do it from the bottom up 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.160
 as you like and we are going to look for this 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.110
 folder that is called etc let's look 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.540
 We will click on the folder and we will 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.740
 go down to need these two files 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.830
 these two files are going to copy 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 and they will keep them in their sd card or in 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.420
 your sd card not on your sd card in your 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.180
 sd card because because in the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 procedure the sd card with everything 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.150
 that you have is going to transform into your 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.340
 external card and everything they have in 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.080
 your internal card will disappear 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.420
 completely then all you have 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.360
 in their internal memory they pass assume it 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.690
 sd card and already after although they are 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 files do not see data or bb that without 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.130
 they do not work the game when the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
 go to the sd and do this second 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.460
 then they will work then 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.750
 everything happens at the base of everything that 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.110
 you want what you want 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.790
 disappear and leave it no problem 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.920
 well these two files are going to 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.300
 copy and they are going to paste a folder yo 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.660
 I already did this procedure, this is my 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.340
 sd card she is not internal memory 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.770
 as you can know the review of 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.870
 one only has two gigs 410 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.750
 megabytes for what is internal memory 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.430
 a giga of ram and a giga for or less 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.990
 for what are the applications that already 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.430
 they come pre-installed or that is that 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.140
 use 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.990
 I increase it with the eight card 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.820
 gigas are obviously not 8 GB is always 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.490
 less or it can be in some cases that 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.250
 them be more then I have 7 gigs and 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.720
 206 megabyte here I have expand memory 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.310
 is adapting that 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.130
 folders are left in the description 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.500
 to download it and I'll leave you 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.870
 if anything, the original files and I 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.370
 I did at the beginning the first time and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.250
 forgot to really save the files 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.680
 originals and I had to go back to the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.120
 I had to put back because because I 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.770
 I had tested it with a memory 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.840
 smaller than mine, nothing more to see 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.130
 if it served and if it served but I lost both 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.740
 files then I had to search in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.450
 youtube and download them and use it again and 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.090
 already now but I already did it with memory 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.420
 that I wanted the modified files 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.920
 the only difference is that the bowl 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.920
 efe z 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.780
 01 kilobytes the largest is 117 kb in itself 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.440
 the only thing they are going to have to do is 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.299
 give copy there is where are the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.639
 two pieces of paper 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.150
 and they're going to look like this copy here they go 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.910
 to come here that is the folder etc and 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.570
 they will copy here 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.000
 they will appear 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.990
 replace and you are going to give it 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.990
 well I'll do it anyway 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.020
 so they can see replace and replace 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.000
 I already replace them to do this 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.500
 needs to be root guys and girls the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.810
 true if they are not rude this is not going to 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.640
 work because breathing needs root 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.990
 to see all the folders of the 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.760
 system like all testers 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.410
 of files when they want to see the 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.140
 systems folders need to force 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.689
 be the ones already the replacement that we are going to 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.319
 do 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.189
 the easiest thing in the world we left 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.289
 we keep tight 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:08.550
 and we're going to give it a restart it's going to 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.950
 restart the phone 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.569
 and when I turn on 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.919
 they will have already 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.919
 his memory 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.520
 and here you can see space 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.710
 7 gigs storage with 210 megabytes 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.910
 this the truth if it works can 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.190
 do it with any android there is no 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.860
 problem was only unique is that they should 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.630
 find your modified files pongan 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.120
 modified files to use 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.300
 internal memory and the name of your 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 phone and they will appear if they give 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.860
 account no longer shows my sd card and 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.420
 here is everything we are going to lend more 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.830
 international follow-up will appear 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.370
 depending on the memory that you me 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.970
 have installed 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.860
 and to reverse it we are going to enter the 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.280
 expand memory folder and let's 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.130
 give you copy the original files and 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.990
 we beat the others and the 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.950
 we replaced the others that we had already 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.020
 Modified posts 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:14.180
