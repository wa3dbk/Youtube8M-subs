00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
just one rifle eh it kind of made sense

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.710

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
they'd be trusting around and all of a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.280 
they'd be trusting around and all of a
sudden<00:03:31.209> like<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.450> enemy<00:03:32.780> would<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:33.020> like<00:03:33.140> what
