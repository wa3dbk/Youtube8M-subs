cycle is that I use two minutes for the
front<00:03:31.319> part<00:03:31.850> two<00:03:32.850> minutes<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.510> might<00:03:33.690> think

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
front part two minutes you might think

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.720 
front part two minutes you might think
this<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.079> crazy<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.160> what<00:03:35.370> works<00:03:35.609> for

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
this is crazy but this is what works for

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030 
this is crazy but this is what works for
me<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.209> that's<00:03:37.140> what<00:03:37.290> I've<00:03:37.410> been<00:03:37.440> doing

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
me and that's what I've been doing

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.949 
me and that's what I've been doing
so<00:03:38.700> since<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.269> has<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> two<00:03:39.870> minute<00:03:40.049> cycle<00:03:40.440> I

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
so since this has a two minute cycle I

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.449 
so since this has a two minute cycle I
turn<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.650> use<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.980> first<00:03:44.160> two
