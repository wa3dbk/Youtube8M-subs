every<00:01:06.479> month<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.380> also<00:01:07.560> something<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.130> help

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310

me<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.880> prioritize<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.869> email<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
me to really prioritize the email so I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.810 
me to really prioritize the email so I
wouldn't<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> sift<00:01:11.460> through<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
wouldn't have to sift through it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
wouldn't have to sift through it
manually<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.780> figure<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.890> most

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
manually and figure out what was most

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
manually and figure out what was most
important<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:15.030> needed<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.509> rise<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> top

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
important what needed to rise to the top
