00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.120
 and what happens people welcome here you 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.549
 I bring a new video of friends and how 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.870
 you see is on the map of jayaque marinas and 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.320
 I'm studying the filling of the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.320
 studying 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.760
 the goal of is carnatge as in the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.700
 previous video this time as you see 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.710
 we have silenced and friends because a 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.140
 friend of mine left a couple of nights ago 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.310
 said davis and likes the scale h 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.070
 fontela with your initiator because I change 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.140
 mogollÃ³n is a pepinazo that is a bit 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.059
 illogical does not get silenced like that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.650
 brings the strength of the bullet 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.350
 The distance etc etc etc 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.940
 the hell is that killing is the 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 second part going up a bit is the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.670
 second part of a domain in which 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.170
 between when I was about to finish 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.420
 the first one why I do not upload the first 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.500
 copy 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.449
 so I put the batteries in this second 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.309
 part and I say it's not that it's a 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.440
 killing but it's a lot of difference 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.870
 friends the difference between fish 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.670
 and teams live differently here 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.850
 it follows more as more competitive I do not know 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.460
 how to explain it you get into domain and it's 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.500
 brutal is here I did not go out back they take it 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.250
 they do not take themselves very seriously not talking about 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 camper ism I do not know is different and here 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.299
 as it is more difficult to say so 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.190
 because it's harder because it's more 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.930
 easy here how is this from me like 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.900
 sector that is easier 5th 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.420
 but it is already 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.120
 if friends is easier by right of 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.340
 carry the mouse the precision is much better 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.570
 that extinguishes better to have the precision of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.430
 a whole hand that with the thumb 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.530
 on one hand is not the decision clearly 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.910
 It is larger, so any park 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.280
 fucking league because you can kill the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.530
 head quickly you know and that too 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.540
 I said that there is with the console theme 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.260
 because the console does have its command 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.120
 better than another 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.860
 it carries the bar I have a command of 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.890
 shit and that even upload photos that was 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.040
 a fucking shit that had a lot 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.040
 difference 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.790
 those two back points that has 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 back then they are a fucking wonder 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.950
 because it gives you much more mobility without 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.759
 need to have fingers 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.470
 let's say divided between several buttons 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.420
 because the back buttons allow you 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.360
 jump and bend over and that then gives a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.810
 incredible mobility to an enemy that does not 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.810
 have one 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:34.970
 and it's the difference that I've seen in the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.970
 pc I do alone is costing me but it 's 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.599
 happy because it's a game game 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.670
 just because when you play with friends it's 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.019
 more mine would be big difference I started to 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.140
 console that almost everyone plays 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.140
 here 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.260
 as it is in this way as extreme 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.190
 by the fact that it is easier still 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.860
 than normal because the subject of when 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.269
 they shoot you right away in normal 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.129
 people do not look for him to play because 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.629
 they say that many campers and because 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.890
 there are always the typical critics this 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.959
 without domain that takes a lot of eggs and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.879
 so for me to get this little leg out 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.879
 a part for me for me 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.780
 teeth and that friends and I wanted to 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.730
 just calm it down because it seemed to me 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.920
 very illogical the fact that a soul that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.870
 used was better and this weapon then 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.030
 we go apart that I already told you no I do not know 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.980
 if for previous vido I told you that the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.019
 weapon 24 had gone to second place 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.700
 for me it has always been now in 94 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.370
 a cane but this guy and over 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.989
 with muffler I do not know is different mola 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.319
 that's why I say that I'm hooked 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.510
 because it's different the computer is there 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.299
 there is more quality due to the fact that it is 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.640
 easier and that's unique I want it 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.480
 comment in this video about this 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.720
 weapon as part of taking out the video because 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.780
 this 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.080
 I want to thank all the support 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.490
 I'm having 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.660
 through you because of the fact that 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.220
 I'm uploaded several sites at the same time and 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.620
 I am I want you to know friends that I am 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.210
 that I do well is something of pride and 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.650
 not for nothing but because it is that I 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.120
 I'm going to upload videos and you're going to 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.430
 noticing that you're shitting I'm noticing is 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.920
 more because it does nothing was a convoy of 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.900
 the week now I'm going up a 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.109
 video every two days and I feel like it because 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.190
 between the battlefield series 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.980
 we have to know what the outcome is 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.810
 of this new although many people do not 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.640
 like is that I like is that unless you 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.130
 they spend fucking feeding me and that is 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.900
 note a lot when commenting because 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.610
 if something knows also is that I am very 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.530
 transparent because when you are taking 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.030
 said I've transmitted it in a video and 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.130
 When it's been good, there's a lot of talk 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.680
 when more subscribers rise when 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.880
 the better I've spent it in this game 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.060
 in this channel these people that I go to 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.060
 leave 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.060
 yes yes yes yes I have to start uploading 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.979
 like the weirdest because I have 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.050
 that put the batteries with this boards 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.460
 because I was becoming the girl 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.690
 nothing more friends I hope this video is 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.330
 he liked that you vote favorites like 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.770
 you want and every time you have even the 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.770
 next and goodbye
