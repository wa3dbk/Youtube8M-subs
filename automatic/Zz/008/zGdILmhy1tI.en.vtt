00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.519
 hello again how about how are you in the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.469
 today's video I come to show you the five 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.620
 products that I have used the most during 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.970
 the month of April this time only os 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.040
 I'm going to teach makeup products 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.289
 so nothing if you want to know what they are 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.420
 do not go and stay, I'll start with 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.460
 products for eyes and I teach you that I have 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.830
 rescued from the drawer this eyeliner 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.859
 l'oréal that I am super liner show culture 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.019
 and well I have been the eyeliner that I have most 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.260
 used during this month of April by 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.610
 not to say the only one because I think that in 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.170
 twice it used a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.329
 eyeliner that has not been this but 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.879
 every day I made up with this 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.800
 same product is a eyeliner that 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.960
 love above all for the similarity that 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.300
 have with the physicians booster 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.030
 formula that as you know is my eyeliner 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.370
 favorite is that it has a tip that does not 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.699
 it's felt but it's kind of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.859
 pen tip as the pelitos 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.580
 product reaches the tip of the 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.070
 applicator and we can draw a line 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.679
 from a super thin line to a line 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.480
 a little bit thicker is also a 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.360
 pretty black enough formula 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.070
 intense and quite durable so I 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.260
 love it and I think it's going to be the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.300
 eyeliner you most use from 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.100
 now well this is the eyeliner 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.070
 I was going to teach you the tip 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.210
 so you can see her there you can see her 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.370
 as a kind of tip 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.380
 of marker but it does not become a 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.590
 fidelity tip second product that you 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.500
 I teach in this top 5 is my mask 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.480
 favorite of the month of April is this 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.240
 formula physicians that I taught you ago 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.920
 little in the hall yesterday and well it's a 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.420
 hall that had already been recorded since 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.780
 time so this mascara 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.300
 me using like two weeks or something 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.490
 this is a mask that I love 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.550
 solvent in the hall that the brush 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.090
 had liked it so much at a glance and 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.120
 is that he distributes the great product he takes 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.800
 all the tabs individually the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.260
 great comb 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.360
 elongga brings a little volume 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.830
 also although good as you know 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.890
 all mascara mascara las 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.290
 combined with the extra volume of deliplus 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.630
 it is a mask that by itself works 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.550
 very well leaves the eyelash very beautiful and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.230
 well also the packaging is a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.390
 precious and good then I teach you that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.370
 this is the packaging of this mask 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.140
 I already showed you eyelashes in the hall of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.240
 yesterday that I'll leave it in the box of 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 information in case you have not seen it and 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.020
 I show you the brush that is a 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.380
 wonder of truth 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.420
 leaves the lovely brush tab and 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.400
 well the formula is also very good 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.300
 it is also not a very liquid formula 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.800
 neither very thick I do not know is the kind of 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.360
 formula that I love for a 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.240
 eyelash mask another product that 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.740
 I want to stand out in this video is this 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.740
 shadow of l'oréal which is the shadow 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.990
 infallible in the tone now you see them and it's 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.370
 the shadow that I used during this 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.260
 month to illuminate me the area of 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.330
 In fact, it is the lacrimal 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.940
 same and I love the effect that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.040
 leaves is a super bright shadow is a 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.320
 shadow that has a very texture 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.840
 nice very soft has a 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.610
 brutal pigmentation and I love good 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.890
 I teach you that you can see that it is a 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.140
 wonder I just taught you in the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.900
 hall that I imagine will be the video that 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.910
 I have gone up before this and that is 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.090
 a past shadow and the two products 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680
 What I have left are facial products 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.660
 also makeup as I said 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.790
 at the beginning of the video and well I have to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.650
 highlight without any doubt this base of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.940
 makeup that is the fixed and covering of 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.880
 d-link plus because I was surprised 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.530
 very much is a foundation of makeup that 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.200
 for the price that it has, it seems to me that it is 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.959
 great is a base covering is a base 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.700
 Durable with a beautiful and good finish 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.130
 that I am very happy with her 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.350
 has solar protection 25 that is 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.880
 great so I see it super complete and 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.440
 Well, it's a foundation for 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.110
 which I have also spoken to you in the hall 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.730
 perhaps the only thing that takes this base 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.190
 in my point of view it's the tones 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.650
 maybe they should take out more 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.480
 variety mostly more sub tones because 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.780
 I understand that all sub tones 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.090
 that it has are pink so maybe 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.730
 should launch intermediate tones that 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.950
 were of its yellowish but good tone 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.930
 for everything else it seems to me a basis that 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.750
 it's great that it's worth trying 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.000
 and already finished this video teaching is my 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.270
 favorite being color of the moment that is 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.760
 the dallas rouge of benefit I love 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.130
 is the one that I use the most with 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.080
 is that I find it a beautiful blush and 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.360
 I am very earth tones for 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.030
 cheeks because I think they combine 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.160
 with everything so for the same reason what 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.050
 I'm using a lot with tone 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.200
 land that also under my point of view 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.940
 favors a lot 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.440
 and well I show you closely so that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.540
 you see it there you have the tonality of 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.740
 dallas blusher you see that it has 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.150
 small flashes in silver and then I 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.720
 love it is also a very blusher 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.700
 pigmented that smells great and that from 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.200
 my point of view favors all types 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.000
 of skins as there have been people who have 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.070
 asked to see if the dallas and the ro 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.470
 cater they look like I'm going to make a 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.530
 comparative between them so you can see 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.900
 that even though at first glance they are 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.030
 very similar tones once placed on 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.100
 the skin are quite different look there 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.380
 you have the top one is the dallas and 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.350
 the bottom one is the ro cater as you see the 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.960
 ro kánter is clearly more pink and 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.900
 It also has that kind of shine 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.690
 also pink and yet the dallas 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.150
 it's much more brown with sparkles 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.650
 silver is worth so if you had 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.380
 doubts so you can see the comparison 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.600
 between both tones that have nothing that 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.310
 see actually, these are my five 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.230
 Favorite products of the month of April 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.390

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.139
