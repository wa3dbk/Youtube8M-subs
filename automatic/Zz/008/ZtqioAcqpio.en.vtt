I'm going to go into the settings and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
I'm going to go into the settings and
I'm<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> set<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.079> IP<00:01:01.289> address<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
I'm going to set my IP address and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.759 
I'm going to set my IP address and
subnet<00:01:02.399> mask<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:04.350> you're<00:01:04.470> setting<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
subnet mask so when you're setting the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
subnet mask so when you're setting the
IP<00:01:04.860> address<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.549> set<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.000> IP<00:01:06.180> address<00:01:06.360> that's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
IP address just set an IP address that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
IP address just set an IP address that's
above<00:01:07.680> anything<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.790> could<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.240> working

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
above anything that could be working

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
above anything that could be working
within<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:10.189> network<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.210> doesn't

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
within your network so that it doesn't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
within your network so that it doesn't
conflict<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.869> anything<00:01:13.229> else<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.010> more

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
conflict with anything else or so more

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.830 
conflict with anything else or so more
importantly<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.220> return<00:01:17.220> ping

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
importantly you don't get a return ping

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
importantly you don't get a return ping
that<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:19.080> actually<00:01:19.680> end<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.340> testing

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
that you're actually end up testing

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.020 
that you're actually end up testing
something<00:01:21.030> else<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> other<00:01:22.110> than<00:01:22.380> your

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
something else that and other than your

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
something else that and other than your
intended<00:01:24.030> CMM<00:01:24.630> 3:21

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
intended CMM 3:21

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
intended CMM 3:21
so<00:01:25.820> now<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.909> I've<00:01:27.119> selected<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:27.900> going

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so now that I've selected that I'm going

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
so now that I've selected that I'm going
to<00:01:28.080> download<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> run<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:31.280> once<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to download and run that and once this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.450 
to download and run that and once this
is<00:01:32.549> done<00:01:33.350> downloading<00:01:34.350> I'll<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.070> able<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> turn

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is done downloading I'll be able to turn

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
is done downloading I'll be able to turn
on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> outputs<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.600> test<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> CMM<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.810> here

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
on the outputs and test the CMM and here

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.980 
on the outputs and test the CMM and here
we<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:40.920> run<00:01:41.100> mode<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.630> two

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we go so our in run mode and I have two

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
we go so our in run mode and I have two
two<00:01:43.770> ports<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> test<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.240> test

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
two ports that I want to test to test

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
two ports that I want to test to test
the<00:01:46.850> ethernet<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.180> first<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.590> 10

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the ethernet so first one is this 10

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.289 
the ethernet so first one is this 10
base<00:01:50.130> T<00:01:51.020> using<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.200> Ethernet<00:01:52.649> cable<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
base T using an Ethernet cable I have it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.780 
base T using an Ethernet cable I have it
plugged<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.869> local<00:01:55.340> plug<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.670> our

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
plugged into a local plug here on our

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.870 
plugged into a local plug here on our
network<00:01:57.770> now<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> want<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.640> once

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
network now what you want to do is once

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.160 
network now what you want to do is once
you've<00:02:00.030> plugged<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> wait

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you've plugged that in you want to wait

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.580 
you've plugged that in you want to wait
for<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.530> land<00:02:01.979> led<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.210> start<00:02:03.450> blinking<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
for this land led to start blinking and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.180 
for this land led to start blinking and
once<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.009> blinking<00:02:05.280> which<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.790> now

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
once that's blinking which it is now

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.570 
once that's blinking which it is now
it's<00:02:08.190> okay<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> test

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's okay to test

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.610 
it's okay to test
if<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.510> don't<00:02:11.780> wait<00:02:11.960> for<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.380> blink

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
if you don't wait for that to blink

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.500 
if you don't wait for that to blink
you're<00:02:12.770> not<00:02:12.890> going<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> get<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> response<00:02:13.520> so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you're not going to get a response so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
you're not going to get a response so
now<00:02:14.630> I've<00:02:14.780> opened<00:02:14.930> up<00:02:15.170> my<00:02:15.350> command<00:02:15.890> prompt<00:02:16.550> in

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
now I've opened up my command prompt in

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
selected now I want to check the aui

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.840 
selected now I want to check the aui
port<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.890> same<00:02:49.070> information<00:02:49.550> but

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
port so it's the same information but

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.920 
port so it's the same information but
it's<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.240> through<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> different<00:02:50.660> type<00:02:50.900> of

it's going through a different type of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.130 
it's going through a different type of
port<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:52.010> do<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.870> I'm<00:02:53.870> going<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.080> be

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
port and to do that I'm going to be

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.670 
port and to do that I'm going to be
using<00:02:54.290> this

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
using this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.700
