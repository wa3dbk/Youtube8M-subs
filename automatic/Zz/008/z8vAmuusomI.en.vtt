for an airplane what allows this airflow
we'll<00:01:17.630> be<00:01:17.810> able<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:17.990> fly<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.500> slow<00:01:18.829> is<00:01:19.189> this

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
we'll be able to fly so slow is this

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.330 
we'll be able to fly so slow is this
leading<00:01:19.790> edge<00:01:20.030> flat<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.840> that's<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.200> fix<00:01:21.829> lat

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
leading edge flat and that's a fix lat

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.429 
leading edge flat and that's a fix lat
also<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.240> way<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.570> airplane<00:01:24.320> is

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
also the way this airplane is

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.010 
also the way this airplane is
constructed<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.399> has<00:01:25.579> metal<00:01:26.270> ribs<00:01:26.630> and

constructed is it has metal ribs and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.700 
constructed is it has metal ribs and
then<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.130> skin<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:28.909> actually<00:01:29.420> fabric<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.560> can

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
then the skin is actually fabric you can

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.920 
then the skin is actually fabric you can
see<00:01:30.979> this<00:01:31.430> airplane<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.210> certified

do that is this site and basically when

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.100 
do that is this site and basically when

I pull the airplane vertical I lay this

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.630 
I pull the airplane vertical I lay this
down<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.470> horizon<00:02:59.950> that<00:02:59.980> gives<00:03:00.340> me<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.490> nice

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
for inverted and you see the string here

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.199 
for inverted and you see the string here
be<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> lot<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.040> people<00:03:09.250> ask<00:03:09.430> what<00:03:09.820> that's<00:03:10.030> all

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
be a lot of people ask what that's all

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.150 
be a lot of people ask what that's all
about<00:03:10.320> when<00:03:11.320> you're<00:03:11.440> trying<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.739> slide<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
about when you're trying to slide the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.160 
about when you're trying to slide the
airplane<00:03:12.489> backwards<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.330> competition<00:03:13.900> you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
airplane backwards in a competition you

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.500 
airplane backwards in a competition you
have<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.380> be<00:03:14.590> able<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.800> slide<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.100> both<00:03:15.760> with<00:03:16.450> a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
have to be able to slide it both with a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.360 
have to be able to slide it both with a
wheels<00:03:16.959> up<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.440> then<00:03:17.620> also<00:03:17.800> with<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.190> wheels

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
wheels up and then also with the wheels

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.550 
wheels up and then also with the wheels
down<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.239> it's<00:03:19.420> really<00:03:19.720> important<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> know

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
down so it's really important to know

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.470 
down so it's really important to know
just<00:03:21.100> when<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> aircraft<00:03:21.790> starts<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.270> slide

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
just when the aircraft starts to slide

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.330 
just when the aircraft starts to slide
backwards<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:23.230> order<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.560> be<00:03:23.680> able<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.920> do<00:03:24.130> that

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
backwards in order to be able to do that

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.580 
backwards in order to be able to do that
so<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.910> string<00:03:25.150> will<00:03:25.180> go<00:03:25.450> from<00:03:25.690> here<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:26.470> know

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
so the string will go from here you know

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.290 
so the string will go from here you know
be<00:03:26.800> pointed<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.250> way<00:03:27.489> here<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.030> allows

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
be pointed this way here and that allows

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.670 
be pointed this way here and that allows
you<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.570> know<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.750> when<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.320> falling

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
you to know that when you're falling

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.140 
you to know that when you're falling

one<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> new<00:03:33.480> additions<00:03:33.989> for<00:03:34.230> fleet<00:03:34.620> was

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
one of the new additions for fleet was

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.789 
one of the new additions for fleet was
2005<00:03:36.030> Meridian<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.810> biggest<00:03:37.230> difference<00:03:37.620> is

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
2005 Meridian the biggest difference is

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.679 
2005 Meridian the biggest difference is
it<00:03:37.950> has<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.099> turboprop<00:03:38.579> basically<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.360> jet

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
order to keep it from flaring and it's

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.530 
order to keep it from flaring and it's
also<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:33.350> form<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:34.310> power<00:04:34.460> steering<00:04:34.880> say<00:04:35.419> we

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
also a form of power steering say we

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.969 
also a form of power steering say we
need<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.720> Fleck<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.110> aileron<00:04:36.440> upwards<00:04:36.860> like

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
need to Fleck the aileron upwards like

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.250 
need to Fleck the aileron upwards like
this<00:04:37.280> there's<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.030> ton<00:04:38.270> of<00:04:38.300> force<00:04:38.600> pushing<00:04:38.900> back

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
this there's a ton of force pushing back

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.210 
this there's a ton of force pushing back
on<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.560> aileron

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
on the aileron

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.420 
on the aileron
air<00:04:40.910> hits<00:04:41.210> us<00:04:41.419> spade<00:04:41.990> or<00:04:42.020> shovel<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.889> put<00:04:43.310> it

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
air hits us spade or shovel and put it

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.140 
air hits us spade or shovel and put it
up<00:04:43.580> backwards

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
up backwards

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.270 
up backwards
so<00:04:44.389> with<00:04:44.810> these<00:04:45.020> on<00:04:45.229> there<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.950> basically

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
so with these on there it basically

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.490 
so with these on there it basically
makes<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.700> so<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.900> can<00:04:48.050> move<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.380> Ale

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
makes it so that you can move the Ale

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.320 
makes it so that you can move the Ale
around<00:04:48.800> really<00:04:49.070> really<00:04:49.430> easy<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.910> hardly

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
around really really easy you hardly

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.530 
around really really easy you hardly
even<00:04:50.479> feel<00:04:50.600> it

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540
