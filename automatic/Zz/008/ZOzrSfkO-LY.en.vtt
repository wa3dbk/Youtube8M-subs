probably my am air pump which is by
brain<00:00:59.129> currently<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> moment<00:01:00.000> against

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
brain currently in the moment against

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.680 
brain currently in the moment against
the<00:01:00.329> wall<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> yeah<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> mean<00:01:02.789> satin<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.329> was

pretty<00:01:03.960> easy<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:05.189> instructions<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.880> really

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pretty easy the instructions are really

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.109 
pretty easy the instructions are really
good<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:06.479> no<00:01:06.900> DVD<00:01:07.320> comes<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
good now no DVD comes with it but you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
good now no DVD comes with it but you
know<00:01:09.299> unlike<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> FX<00:01:10.260> 5<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.250> don't

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
know unlike the FX 5 but you don't

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.380 
know unlike the FX 5 but you don't
really<00:01:11.580> need<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.090> honest<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
really need it to be honest the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.670 
really need it to be honest the
instructions<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.170> clear<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> if

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
instructions are pretty clear and if

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.640 
instructions are pretty clear and if
you've<00:01:13.830> set<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.100> an<00:01:14.280> FX<00:01:14.549> 5<00:01:14.790> before<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:16.049> any<00:01:16.350> fit

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you've set up an FX 5 before or any fit

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.789 
you've set up an FX 5 before or any fit
where<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.729> common<00:01:18.030> sense

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
where really it's kind of common sense

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
where really it's kind of common sense
most<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> pipes<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.229> good

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
most of it the pipes are really good

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.330 
most of it the pipes are really good
really<00:01:22.650> strong<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.200> obviously<00:01:25.860> these<00:01:26.070> bits

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
really strong and obviously these bits

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
really strong and obviously these bits
which<00:01:26.520> holds<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.600> lid<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.259> are

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
which holds the the lid down are

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.890 
which holds the the lid down are
absolutely<00:01:29.040> solid

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
absolutely solid

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.520 
absolutely solid
they<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.409> tough<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:33.079> as<00:01:34.079> far<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
they really are tough and as far as the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
they really are tough and as far as the
media<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.950> comes<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.790> unlike<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> FX

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
media that comes with this unlike the FX

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
media that comes with this unlike the FX
5<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> fair<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.610> mean

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
put another two packs in and absolutely

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.420 
put another two packs in and absolutely
packed<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.579> carbon<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.180> well<00:01:52.430> just

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
packed it with more carbon as well just

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.469 
packed it with more carbon as well just
so<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.729> keep<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.090> healthy<00:01:54.420> bacteria<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
so I can keep more healthy bacteria and

good
seems<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> great<00:02:48.060> filter<00:02:48.329> I<00:02:48.629> know<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.349> lot

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
seems like a great filter I know a lot

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.899 
seems like a great filter I know a lot
of<00:02:49.560> people<00:02:49.889> aren't<00:02:50.099> buying<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.579> at<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.700> moment

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
of people aren't buying it at the moment

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.509 
of people aren't buying it at the moment
they<00:02:51.359> are<00:02:51.389> a<00:02:51.870> bit<00:02:52.650> concerned<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.190> possible

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
they are a bit concerned with possible

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.640 
they are a bit concerned with possible
problems<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> FX<00:02:54.840> 5s<00:02:55.290> are<00:02:55.409> doing

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
problems with it and the FX 5s are doing

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.530 
problems with it and the FX 5s are doing
just<00:02:55.859> as<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.250> FX<00:02:56.549> 5<00:02:56.760> does<00:02:57.090> actually<00:02:57.269> have

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
just as good the FX 5 does actually have

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.069 
just as good the FX 5 does actually have
a<00:02:57.569> higher<00:02:57.780> i/o<00:02:58.349> flow<00:02:58.859> rate<00:02:59.569> but<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.689> isn't<00:03:00.959> by

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
a higher i/o flow rate but it isn't by

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.050 
a higher i/o flow rate but it isn't by
much<00:03:01.319> really<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.180> more<00:03:05.060> economical

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
much really and this is more economical

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.879 
much really and this is more economical
in<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.420> sense<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.819> there's<00:03:08.819> less<00:03:09.060> power

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
in the sense that it there's less power

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.619 
in the sense that it there's less power
what<00:03:10.889> wattage<00:03:11.250> sorry<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.030> say<00:03:12.180> less<00:03:12.420> watch

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
what wattage sorry so say less watch

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.110 
what wattage sorry so say less watch

going for a easy to you know the to fill
it<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.359> water<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:19.109> there's<00:03:19.290> no

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
it with water and you know there's no

job done
yeah<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.430> think<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.699> only<00:03:29.849> difference<00:03:29.909> between

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
yeah I think the only difference between

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.089 
yeah I think the only difference between
this<00:03:30.449> and<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.690> FX<00:03:30.930> 5<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.349> pretty<00:03:31.650> much<00:03:31.829> is

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
this and the FX 5 is pretty much is

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.150 
this and the FX 5 is pretty much is
these<00:03:32.280> little<00:03:32.579> dolls<00:03:32.760> there
