00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
the default

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.550 
the default
one<00:02:14.310> sided<00:02:14.579> or<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.909> single<00:02:15.209> sided<00:02:15.450> setting<00:02:16.049> -

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
one sided or a single sided setting -

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.670 
one sided or a single sided setting -

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
two sided or double sided as this

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.309 
two sided or double sided as this
document<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.310> double-sided<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:21.569> now<00:02:21.810> ready

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
document is double-sided I'm now ready

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.089 
document is double-sided I'm now ready
to<00:02:22.409> go<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.329> it'll<00:02:24.329> hit<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.750> start<00:02:25.019> button<00:02:28.099> and

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
to go and it'll hit the start button and

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.059 
to go and it'll hit the start button and
you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.489> see<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:29.909> it's<00:02:30.750> over<00:02:31.019> 100<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
you can see now that it's over 100 and I

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.709 
you can see now that it's over 100 and I
think<00:02:32.609> it's<00:02:32.730> around<00:02:32.849> hundred<00:02:33.329> and<00:02:33.420> fifty

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
think it's around hundred and fifty

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.629 
think it's around hundred and fifty
pages<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.139> minute<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.159> this<00:02:35.280> particular

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
pages a minute so this particular

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.509 
pages a minute so this particular
document<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.659> 80<00:02:36.989> pages<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:38.280> should

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
document it's 80 pages and that should

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.420 
document it's 80 pages and that should
take<00:02:38.700> roughly<00:02:39.540> around<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.769> bit<00:02:40.950> over<00:02:41.219> 30

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
take roughly around a little bit over 30

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:54.720 
take roughly around a little bit over 30
seconds<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.239> complete

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.500 

and<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.040> go<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.819> document<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.420> a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and there we go that's a document of a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.559 
and there we go that's a document of a
fair-sized<00:02:59.019> heidi<00:02:59.530> pages<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:01.269> will<00:03:01.450> now

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
fair-sized heidi pages and this will now

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.699 
fair-sized heidi pages and this will now
