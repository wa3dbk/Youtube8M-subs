00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
wave shaped opening feature I should

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.469 
wave shaped opening feature I should
clear<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> probably<00:01:09.330> some

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
clear that up then this is probably some

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
clear that up then this is probably some
information<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.020> Kershaw<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.979> your

information about Kershaw and your

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.109 
information about Kershaw and your
warranty<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.939> stuff<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:20.090> saw<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
warranty and all that stuff I saw a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.620 
warranty and all that stuff I saw a
couple<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> forms<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> they

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
couple of these on the forms and they

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
couple of these on the forms and they
had<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.710> tool<00:01:25.920> marks<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.310> stuff<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
had some tool marks and stuff like that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
had some tool marks and stuff like that
one<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.420> looks<00:01:27.780> pretty

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
one but this one actually looks pretty

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.520 
one but this one actually looks pretty
good

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
good

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
good
the<00:01:29.240> blade<00:01:30.240> seems<00:01:30.630> centered<00:01:31.880> that's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> little

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the blade seems centered that's a little

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.640 
the blade seems centered that's a little
stiff<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.720> sure<00:01:33.840> take<00:01:34.110> some<00:01:34.259> break<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
stiff but I'm sure take some break in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.249 
stiff but I'm sure take some break in
you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.310> there's<00:01:35.520> some<00:01:35.750> some<00:01:36.750> oil<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can see there's some some oil in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.230 
you can see there's some some oil in
there<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> reasonably<00:01:41.460> early<00:01:41.520> lockup

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there so it's a reasonably early lockup

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
there so it's a reasonably early lockup
this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.110> Ti<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.770> stainless<00:01:43.950> steel

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
this is not Ti this is stainless steel

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
this is not Ti this is stainless steel
and<00:01:44.810> there<00:01:45.810> seems<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.439> questions

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and there seems to be some questions

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
and there seems to be some questions
around<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.869> blade<00:01:49.320> steel<00:01:49.729> I've<00:01:50.729> seen<00:01:51.030> both<00:01:51.210> 8

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
around the blade steel I've seen both 8

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
around the blade steel I've seen both 8
CR<00:01:51.810> 13<00:01:52.409> MOV<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> HCR<00:01:54.119> 14<00:01:54.689> MOV<00:01:55.670> doesn't<00:01:56.670> really

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
CR 13 MOV and HCR 14 MOV doesn't really

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.340 
CR 13 MOV and HCR 14 MOV doesn't really
matter<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:57.990> opinion

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
matter much to me because in my opinion

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.350 
matter much to me because in my opinion
both<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.649> pretty<00:01:58.799> low<00:01:59.040> grade<00:01:59.340> entry<00:02:00.060> level

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
both are pretty low grade entry level

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
both are pretty low grade entry level
steels<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.229> Kershaw<00:02:01.590> Kai<00:02:01.829> stamp<00:02:02.189> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
steels so we have Kershaw Kai stamp and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770 
steels so we have Kershaw Kai stamp and
I<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> serial<00:02:03.299> number<00:02:03.329> or

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
I don't know if it's a serial number or

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
I don't know if it's a serial number or
what<00:02:05.689> probably<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.810> gonna<00:02:06.899> come<00:02:06.990> through

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
what probably not gonna come through

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.249 
what probably not gonna come through
and<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:08.700> looks<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.570> special<00:02:09.899> emerson

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and then looks like a special emerson

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.710 
and then looks like a special emerson
logo<00:02:10.590> may<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.580> back<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:11.940> Kershaw<00:02:12.240> bags<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
logo may be back for Kershaw bags and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.990 
logo may be back for Kershaw bags and
then<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> skull<00:02:14.750> lock<00:02:15.750> feels<00:02:16.020> great<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.410> it

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
then the skull lock feels great on it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.510 
then the skull lock feels great on it
let's<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.300> there's<00:02:18.990> any<00:02:19.140> play<00:02:21.230> now<00:02:22.520> I'd

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
let's see if there's any play now I'd

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.699 
let's see if there's any play now I'd
say<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.850> there's<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.590> about

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
say that there's not what I like about

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.100 
say that there's not what I like about
this<00:02:25.950> blade<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> flats<00:02:27.600> are<00:02:27.810> brushed

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
this blade is that the flats are brushed

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.060 
this blade is that the flats are brushed
a<00:02:28.500> satin<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:30.620> let's<00:02:31.620> see<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.950> get

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
a satin and then let's see if we can get

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.170 
a satin and then let's see if we can get
a<00:02:32.100> better<00:02:32.220> shot<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.910> grind

right<00:03:00.390> I'm<00:03:00.930> gonna<00:03:01.080> run<00:03:01.230> through<00:03:01.410> some<00:03:01.590> specs<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
right I'm gonna run through some specs I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.490 
right I'm gonna run through some specs I
think<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.239> big<00:03:03.390> thing<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.260> drawl

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
think the big thing that is the drawl

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.449 
think the big thing that is the drawl
for<00:03:04.650> these<00:03:04.770> knives<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.310> they're

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
for these knives is that they're

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.479 
for these knives is that they're
designed<00:03:05.580> by<00:03:06.000> Emerson<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.660> built<00:03:06.870> by<00:03:07.020> Kershaw

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
designed by Emerson but built by Kershaw

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.130 
designed by Emerson but built by Kershaw
so<00:03:08.489> what's<00:03:08.880> really<00:03:08.970> cool<00:03:09.180> about<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.900> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
so what's really cool about that is it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.590 
so what's really cool about that is it
gives<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.380> an<00:03:10.500> opportunity<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.370> step<00:03:11.880> into<00:03:12.090> an

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
gives you an opportunity to step into an

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380 
gives you an opportunity to step into an
emerson<00:03:12.930> design<00:03:13.350> knife<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:14.220> 35<00:03:14.700> bucks<00:03:14.970> that's

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
emerson design knife for 35 bucks that's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.330 
emerson design knife for 35 bucks that's
why<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.600> think<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.049> paid<00:03:16.230> 36<00:03:16.830> for<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.250> have

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
why I think I paid 36 for this to have

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.600 
why I think I paid 36 for this to have
it<00:03:17.430> shipped<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.670> my<00:03:17.790> house<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.410> now<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.280> not

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
it shipped to my house and now it's not

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.490 
it shipped to my house and now it's not
a<00:03:20.910> replacement<00:03:21.299> or<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> clone<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.080> an<00:03:22.290> emerson

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
a replacement or a clone of an emerson

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.330 
a replacement or a clone of an emerson
but<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.280> an<00:03:24.000> emerson<00:03:24.299> design<00:03:24.720> it's

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
but it is it is an emerson design it's

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.430 
but it is it is an emerson design it's
built<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:27.120> china<00:03:27.420> for<00:03:27.660> Kershaw<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.320> has

feels pretty good I don't say the
ergonomics<00:04:18.450> are<00:04:18.539> good<00:04:19.099> because<00:04:20.099> everybody's

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
ergonomics are good because everybody's

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.240 
ergonomics are good because everybody's
hands<00:04:20.789> different<00:04:21.209> but<00:04:21.450> this<00:04:21.660> does

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
hands different but this does

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.730 
hands different but this does
good<00:04:22.550> in<00:04:22.970> my<00:04:23.240> hand<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.900> I'll<00:04:24.200> do<00:04:24.410> some<00:04:24.560> cut

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
good in my hand and I'll do some cut

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.820 
good in my hand and I'll do some cut
tests<00:04:25.130> or<00:04:25.340> some<00:04:25.610> cut<00:04:25.820> videos<00:04:26.530> and<00:04:27.530> we'll<00:04:27.680> see

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
tests or some cut videos and we'll see

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.120 
tests or some cut videos and we'll see
how<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.130> does

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
how it does

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.300

tantos<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:18.320> lot<00:05:18.710> of<00:05:18.800> people<00:05:18.980> are<00:05:19.040> saying<00:05:19.190> that

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
tantos a lot of people are saying that

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.600 
tantos a lot of people are saying that
this<00:05:19.430> is<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.610> version<00:05:19.850> of<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.330> CQC<00:05:20.900> 7<00:05:21.500> but<00:05:22.160> I

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
this is the version of the CQC 7 but I

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.030 
this is the version of the CQC 7 but I
just<00:05:23.120> think<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:24.290> a<00:05:24.380> tanto<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:24.980> it

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
just think that the is a tanto and it

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.890 
just think that the is a tanto and it
might<00:05:25.190> be<00:05:25.280> why<00:05:25.400> it's<00:05:25.640> called<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:25.970> CQC<00:05:26.240> 7<00:05:26.750> K

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
might be why it's called the CQC 7 K

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.400 
might be why it's called the CQC 7 K
I've<00:05:27.350> had<00:05:27.800> two<00:05:27.919> CQC<00:05:28.370> seven<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:30.110> was<00:05:30.229> much

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
I've had two CQC seven and it was much

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:44.560 
I've had two CQC seven and it was much
different<00:05:30.590> than<00:05:30.860> this<00:05:31.010> knife<00:05:43.240> such<00:05:44.240> as<00:05:44.390> eating

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
different than this knife such as eating

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.120 
different than this knife such as eating
that<00:05:44.750> up<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:48.080> was<00:05:48.200> actually<00:05:48.470> with<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.650> tip

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.110 

so<00:05:52.130> I<00:05:52.160> think<00:05:52.340> it's<00:05:52.430> safe<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.580> say<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:52.880> this

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
so I think it's safe to say that this

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.780 
so I think it's safe to say that this
thing<00:05:53.300> will<00:05:54.020> come<00:05:54.169> sharp<00:05:54.500> I<00:05:55.160> bought<00:05:55.490> this<00:05:55.610> as<00:05:55.760> a

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
thing will come sharp I bought this as a

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.280 
thing will come sharp I bought this as a
user<00:05:56.030> I'm<00:05:56.180> actually<00:05:56.300> gonna<00:05:56.510> EDC<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.080> for<00:05:57.229> the

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
user I'm actually gonna EDC it for the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.050 
user I'm actually gonna EDC it for the
next<00:05:57.410> two<00:05:57.590> weeks<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.010> and<00:05:58.460> see<00:05:58.729> how<00:05:58.820> much<00:05:58.940> I

next two weeks and and see how much I
like<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.360> but<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.200> lock<00:06:00.880> disengages<00:06:01.880> great<00:06:02.090> it

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
like it but the lock disengages great it

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.570 
like it but the lock disengages great it
flicks<00:06:03.080> nice<00:06:03.320> I'm<00:06:03.530> sure<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:04.010> it<00:06:04.100> a<00:06:04.130> wave<00:06:04.340> nice

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
it's just based off of the waves being

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.940 
it's just based off of the waves being
the<00:06:07.430> same<00:06:07.640> as<00:06:07.850> other<00:06:08.030> Emerson's<00:06:08.950> lock

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950
