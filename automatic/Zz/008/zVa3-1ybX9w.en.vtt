00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.950
 here 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.429
 and here we go again 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.429
 do not drink alcohol 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.320
 that's what the others do the majority 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.890
 of the team 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.820
 here is the friday better look at it so 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 that's how it's going that I do not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.430
 dream in a very active start up that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:53.190
 ours these few irreducible to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:57.260
 Wood that embody a whole pretzel 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.260
 the day by month decadent rats health 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.739
 just the second and after we do some 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:10.020
 scenes of life that tears its hard hump 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.189
 at least it's hard bump it's not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.250
 fear of lions said it made 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.560
 city scenes of helianthe so pretty 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:26.899
 you see what these thirds do 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.759
 to throw because I also came from the wood 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.509
 and claude jamet school I doubt the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.509
 school ship 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.470
 he is the only one who will work 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.470
 properly this afternoon incest 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.350
 that's what it's about flocking allows 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 a reproduce the erve the thickets all 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.890
 after that, how are we going to ask 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.260
 its with the machine we see there the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.860
 grassmaster of Chinese this morning so 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.200
 it's this device there the device that and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.570
 who learned I heard about 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.870
 20000 volts that's it yes but it's 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.120
 past is not badly played there is not there 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.590
 no draw and that 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.990
 nothing is in fact but the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.790
 flocking on the inside we make it a 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.590
 mix it's a mix you use 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.310
 gross 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.850
 I prefer mixing and filling well 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.430
 the tank not by first because 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.930
 otherwise after that it works 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.280
 until then it's okay and after calling a 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.450
 filter literature that is taken in 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.160
 pincers the filters several sizes 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.840
 of targets for fibers or for after 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 flows that do not have a high throughput 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.620
 ok i really sure it's not bad but 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.590
 in fact it does that allows to make 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.970
 the Serbian grass he can tell how 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.440
 grow straight it's instead 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.060
 to have to tap there that allows me to have 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.370
 wine from 8.9 to grass 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.870
 quirky who occupied up to the top 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.410
 like how do you see us doing 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.720
 face just now 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.880
 this is here and there we will see this at 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.850
 the time you put there on the part 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.280
 funny if the scope of the plan 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.720
 this morning to do them really 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.690
 because through the trees we look 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.240
 it will be marc also the land here we are 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.560
 see the pot of paint tomorrow so there 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.180
 on the bottom before putting the grass from 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.090
 bread already do it because are 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.660
 whites is funny that if we see in 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.770
 through the grass 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.300
 actually it's like it's the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.340
 here is that after my two tones 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.200
 and a word on it but cola cola 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.200
 basic woods on the area 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:43.140
 okay the room in march to the ground 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.490
 and after budding then what are you 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.970
 we're doing there so I'm going to stick 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.880
 the grass 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.280
 so after painting it's about 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.130
 com that's the plowing cua him and if 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.480
 I go there or not a pure and yesterday what 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.340
 it is there free-wood cat also the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.380
 boillat actually has the cua the joy to 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.090
 the wood glue dilute the flocking holds 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:09.240
 no and we will fall the disturbance abl 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.540
 here's one always so here I do not 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.910
 large areas under his chair quickly 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.590
 I planted a nail here okay I 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 wanted to see the award as the club 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.000
 what do you know what years to oneself is the earth 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.410
 march and earth make continuity in 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.060
 does that do what does it bring current 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.670
 know it good that's the continuity 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.740
 close the circuit after he goes there are just 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:38.670
 shaken and the right button era all 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.660
 only classroom excellence and 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.130
 short fibers we do not see much 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.630
 of agreements with the long fibers that's 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.570
 a lot nicer ok 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.090
 there we make large supermarkets 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.100
 very quickly and to finish the decor 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.160
 must add small references of 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.780
 philippe locquet darrois everything you 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.770
 is hungry that affects a casting plan 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:05.150
 also know the patina before it was 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.800
 black gray and there it is patiner way and 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.440
 then after all life to age 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.040
 all because it is different 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.040
 so we see hibernation 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:34.580
 this is the building of the climbing wall 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:36.050
 as it will stop there it's a shame 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.749
 that it has windows that are yours 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.520
 sides 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:42.619
 and if we turn in the direction the entrance 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.259
 on both sides behind there is still 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:48.110
 a door here 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.159
 must see we'll see he told me that 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.379
 it would be closer to the risk wall 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.149
 maybe by putting the bay window 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.779
 in a sense we take advantage of the path of a 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:59.469
 side we will put then we will get around 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.469
 to see 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.010
 So here we come out of the tunnel when 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.180
 cars will roll there is an exit from 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.710
 river and so the tunnel exit from 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.900
 train how his protected without actually the 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.240
 decor for landing the rails the river 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.820
 so then to massat still resides so 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.380
 it's the bottom of the river that and we 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.200
 will find a resin that will give 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.210
 the impression of having water will be 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.710
 harmonized so serve you will harmonize 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:36.430
 everyone who digs and you go 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:39.570
 the harmony of the consoles and we will do 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:45.040
 an owl for it was party supports 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:55.000
 but we put in the room where it was 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:07:01.840
 palace in crp if you put your posts 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.080
 here I am at 23 cm to ride the 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.080
 famous 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:19.199
 it was there 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:29.880
 all the rest the arrival no system 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:36.230
 call to the red wire on the red button 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.230
 the blue white yarn it's simple 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:52.729
 apple sold 3.6
