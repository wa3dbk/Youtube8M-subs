00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that because it helps most of all make

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
that because it helps most of all make
your<00:00:55.110> eye<00:00:55.170> look<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.829> big<00:00:56.039> there's<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
your eye look really big there's a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
your eye look really big there's a
shadow<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.870> happens<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> crease<00:00:58.800> of

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
work with the highlighter shade the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
work with the highlighter shade the
lightest<00:01:26.009> shade<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> applicator

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and I always go right into the inner

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.819 
and I always go right into the inner
corner<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.659> bottom<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> eye<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
it's this cool trick that I do all the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's this cool trick that I do all the
time<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.540> red<00:01:39.780> carpet<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.560> photoshoots

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
then when you've done that go to the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.590 
then when you've done that go to the
bottom<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.939> either<00:01:45.090> leave<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
bottom now you can either leave it like

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.289 
bottom now you can either leave it like
this<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.680> take<00:01:47.130> again<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.820> dark
