00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.210
 the dome of the Basilica of Santa Maria 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.180
 of the fiore or cathedral of santa maria de 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.220
 the flower located in florence italy la 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.170
 cathedral began to be built on the 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.630
 ruins of the Basilica of Santa Repara 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 is beginning construction in the year 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.289
 of 1,296 with the architect's design 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.779
 change arnolfo which died before 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.850
 be finished and did not leave any more details 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.000
 about the construction of the dome not 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.580
 it was later until the year of 1418 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.670
 that the family medicine ruler of the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.340
 region of Florence for the time called 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.680
 to contest for design and construction 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.840
 of the dome today this one stands on 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.120
 the baptistry of the basilica reaching 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.760
 a maximum height of 114 meters above 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.920
 floor is a double sandwich dome 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.840
 inspired by the pantheon of Rome without 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.469
 no internal support and it is built 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.809
 with clay bricks or adobe wood 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.119
 plaster stone and terracotta tiles and 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.979
 mortar brunelleschi experiment with 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.080
 several ways until you conceive of a 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.970
 flower bud which fit 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.750
 perfectly with the octagonal shape of 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.400
 an artery 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.490
 the way of choosing was not the only 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.110
 problem the octagon of 55 meters of 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.540
 diameter was built so 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.880
 irregular resulting in different 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.010
 concentric points of it what 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.140
 it made construction difficult but in the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.050
 xxi divided the diameter of each of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.790
 the vertices in five equal parts 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.410
 taking the edge as the hoist axis 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.020
 from the outer end of each of the 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.210
 external part obtaining the arch of 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.369
 correct elevation for the dome and with 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.890
 this solving the problem of the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.259
 irregularity of the previous construction 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.880
 the dome on its inner side possesses 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.030
 Arched wooden supports in shape 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.770
 vertical and horizontal serving as your 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 skeleton and support the dome is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.369
 divided into several sectors where 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.830
 change the angle of inclination of the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.840
 same these levels take separations 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 of stone that together with the props of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.080
 horizontal wood 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.020
 they help maintain the shape of it 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.729
 the angles are going up by 20 degrees 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.129
 at 40 degrees and ending at 60 degrees 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.019
 when it is completed the dome has a 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.909
 total of 4 million bricks 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.709
 placed the way they were 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.810
 chosen project the dome and the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 Using your materials allows you 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.099
 be self - supporting also gives you the advantage 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.530
 to support their own 37 thousand tons 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.110
 It is capable of supporting 25 thousand tons 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.030
 extras and is resistant to efforts 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.980
 side but all these advantages 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.660
 previously expressed and their capabilities in 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.400
 self-supporting come from the largest 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.590
 solution at the level of ingenuity in the dome 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.620
 and it's the placement of the bricks 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.920
 these are placed in a spiral of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.160
 fishbone placing every bit of 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.810
 bricks horizontal other vertical 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 in a staggered way 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.680
 this ingenious solution made possible the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780
 construction of the dome without any 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.359
 internal support although it's okay 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.730
 documented the materials used and how 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.750
 was its placement is not known to science 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.960
 certain the process by which it was lifted 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.120
 and there are several theories of which 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.600
 three are the most accepted by the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.740
 architects engineers of the world 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.120
 the first the theory of massimo risi 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.490
 urges that on wooden slats and 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.650
 the time the construction was advancing 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.810
 gradually taking as reference the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.420
 lag of one of the edges of the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.610
 octagon corresponding to the face 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.160
 opposite of the side that is 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.410
 building the rowland theory 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.780
 minestrone that refers to the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.070
 construction in stages contemplating 4 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.530
 until the end 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.200
 taking as a reference and guide a unique 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.350
 central axis and finally the theory of 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.000
 Andrea Ruiz posing the construction 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.650
 gradual using reference a central axis 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.530
 but that it is changing its position 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.730
 vertical by stages one of the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.930
 most used tools in the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.000
 construction of the dome and that 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.250
 represents a great innovation was the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.830
 crane type pen invention of own 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.360
 brunelleschi architect these machines 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.280
 made of wood they work with 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.990
 beginning of the pulley and they had a 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.640
 counterweight that allowed the 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.430
 masons upload large amounts of 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.729
 materials 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.410
 and weight at high heights tools 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.620
 versatile and that unlike the 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.160
 used scissor cranes from in old 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.320
 roman 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.380
 they have an axis that allows them 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.380
 turn without the need to dismantle the water
