00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.500
 Hello my name is Maria and these are the 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.200
 8 most polluted cities on the planet 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.599
 number 8 Chernobyl ukraine that the mobile 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.959
 is world famous for the disaster 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.390
 that in 1986 caused the nuclear plant to 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.190
 release the radiation that exceeded 100 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.620
 times the limit allowed in the air 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.480
 after this around 5 thousand suffer 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.460
 thyroid cancer to this day 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.770
 respiratory diseases and 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.260
 Ear diseases threaten all 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.509
 they ask me from the rain zone the 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.670
 area of â€‹â€‹30 kilometers around the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.739
 plant is still uninhabitable and is 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.380
 likely to continue like this for several 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.190
 thousands of years 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.560
 number 7 norlis that russia this city 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.530
 Russian is one of the largest producers 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.960
 of nickel and palladium in the world besides 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.900
 which also extracts platinum cobalt copper 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.700
 and coal was founded in 1975 to make 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.650
 a forced labor camp in 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.840
 siberia but then it became a 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.420
 city where the scores are located 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.880
 of direct responsible liquid this 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.000
 problems such as high pollution and 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.910
 acid rain that has affected the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 mortality by shooters is much more 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.240
 high 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.490
 number 6 during the Cold War of 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.920
 simple was the manufacturing center 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.900
 of chemical weapons and is currently still 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.850
 being the main center of 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.130
 manufacture of chemical producers 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.409
 of roses that's why he entered the book of 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 Guinness records as the most 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.240
 polluted the planet in terms of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.789
 chemical contamination and this several 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.380
 points there are waters that have 17 million 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.250
 of times above the levels 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.710
 permitted 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.110
 the consequences thanks to you more than 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.990
 life of men and women have been 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.990
 reduced to 42 and 47 years 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.750
 number 5 the oroya peru achieved today is the 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.420
 only Latin American city of large 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 but it has won the place with indexes 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.990
 acute to broom before since 1922 99% of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.600
 the factories in the area have submitted 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.000
 lead in your blood plus metals 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.640
 heavy as zinc copper sulfur 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.630
 and lead present in the air affect 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.180
 permanently to its 300 thousand inhabitants 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.490
 the foundation located in the oroya is 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.740
 causing diseases such as loss 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.630
 of memory growth problems and the 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.730
 poor learning and although they have taken 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.800
 certain measures to decrease the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.990
 hiring several studies that 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.740
 they claim that the lead will remain 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.400
 for itself 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.890
 number 4 clean daddy at the south end 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.850
 of a chain of industries that are 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.280
 far from clearing the notability this 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.340
 for the city victim of the waste 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.410
 chemical heavy metals and pesticides the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.030
 lack of water in the area is one of the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.010
 more serious traps since many 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.080
 people are forced to substitute 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.000
 with these polluted waters of the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.700
 city â€‹â€‹so they are common 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.160
 diseases like carcinoma cancer of 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.550
 throat and birth defects the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.800
 underground water exceeds 96 times 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.440
 allowed levels what has led 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.310
 to have heavy metals present 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.970
 also in products of the earth 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.970
 number 3 his fifth india the lead is 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.739
 highly carcinogenic and more than 60% of the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.500
 drinking water in your fifth is 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.510
 contaminated by this heavy metal of 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.120
 made your store has one of the largest 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.550
 chrome opencast mines of the world 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.800
 so the water air and floors have 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.819
 record levels of contamination at the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.530
 global asthma gastrointestinal hemorrhage 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.239
 tuberculosis infertility and even 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.489
 birth defects are some of 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.130
 the diseases to which it is 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.840
 exposed a population of more than 2000 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 detecting 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.110
 number 2 beijing china the explanation 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.120
 so that this city is in the second 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.550
 placed on the list is that more than 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.860
 Half of China's lead production 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.480
 tayyip are produced for years 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.120
 industries of this and other metals 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.280
 heavy have polluted the air the rivers 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.129
 and the agricultural land of this city to 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.459
 number of this country statistics point 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.139
 that 140,000 inhabitants are exposed to 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.479
 diseases that affect the system 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.770
 nervous among others 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.930
 and finally number one Chinese linden to 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.389
 river banks friend in the province of 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.910
 jiangxi the exploitation of the industry 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.370
 of coal legal and illegal mining the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.380
 and car emissions have 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.850
 converted to inp in several years 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.340
 followed in the most polluted city 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.950
 of the world its air is full of coal 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.990
 burned but it's not the only problem the 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.090
 poverty and non - compliance 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.250
 environmental factors generate some 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.680
 diseases such as asthma or cancer 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.600
 lung which affect the areas 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.529
 health of nearly 3 million 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.659
 population 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.179
 Well this is all I hope you have 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.659
 liked please subscribe so I 

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:08.329
 would help to make more videos and well 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.329
 like etcetera etcetera thank you for watching 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.550
 good 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.910
 ah
