let's<00:00:00.299> compare<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.780> carburetor<00:00:01.650> stock<00:00:02.340> slide

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
let's compare a carburetor stock slide

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.610 
let's compare a carburetor stock slide
needle<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.449> stock<00:00:03.720> slide<00:00:04.020> needle<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.560> has

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
needle the stock slide needle that has

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.950 
needle the stock slide needle that has
been<00:00:04.980> trimmed<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.940> tapered<00:00:06.359> slide<00:00:06.629> needle

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
been trimmed and a tapered slide needle

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740 
been trimmed and a tapered slide needle
but<00:00:07.919> first<00:00:08.189> let<00:00:08.760> us<00:00:08.790> look<00:00:09.090> at<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.450> fuel

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
but first let us look at how the fuel

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.290 
but first let us look at how the fuel
flows<00:00:10.110> see<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.219> fuel<00:00:11.490> flows<00:00:11.880> from<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
flows see how the fuel flows from the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.110 
flows see how the fuel flows from the
bottom<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> top<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:14.309> fuel<00:00:14.580> flow<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
bottom to the top the fuel flow is

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.100 
bottom to the top the fuel flow is
restricted<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.900> needle

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
restricted by the needle

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.890 
restricted by the needle
the<00:00:18.800> red<00:00:18.950> dots<00:00:19.250> show<00:00:19.850> where<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:20.300> restriction

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
the red dots show where the restriction

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.100 
the red dots show where the restriction
is<00:00:21.080> at<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:21.440> needle<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:23.119> needle<00:00:23.150> position<00:00:23.600> is

is at the needle the needle position is

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.170 
is at the needle the needle position is
determined<00:00:24.770> by<00:00:24.890> how<00:00:25.070> much<00:00:25.220> throttle<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:25.939> give

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
determined by how much throttle you give

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.109 
determined by how much throttle you give
with<00:00:27.020> no<00:00:27.230> throttle<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.220> needle<00:00:28.550> is<00:00:28.759> at<00:00:28.939> its

needle provide equally more fuel here we

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.400 
needle provide equally more fuel here we
can<00:01:39.370> conclude<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.300> shim<00:01:40.750> stock<00:01:41.080> needle

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.670 
can conclude that a shim stock needle
and<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:42.100> costly<00:01:42.490> aftermarket<00:01:43.210> tapered<00:01:43.630> needle

and a costly aftermarket tapered needle

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.610 
and a costly aftermarket tapered needle
provide<00:01:44.680> similar<00:01:45.040> increased<00:01:45.670> fuel<00:01:46.060> delivery

provide similar increased fuel delivery

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.730 
provide similar increased fuel delivery
next<00:01:47.620> we<00:01:48.280> need<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.580> look<00:01:48.700> at<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.970> main<00:01:49.150> jets
