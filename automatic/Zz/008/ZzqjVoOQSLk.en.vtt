00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
only look beautiful but also function

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.960 
only look beautiful but also function
our<00:03:45.500> typical<00:03:45.770> projects<00:03:46.550> when<00:03:46.700> we<00:03:46.790> do<00:03:46.940> a

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
our typical projects when we do a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.930 
our typical projects when we do a
complete<00:03:47.390> kitchen<00:03:48.110> facelift<00:03:48.890> they<00:03:49.610> range

complete kitchen facelift they range

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.000 
complete kitchen facelift they range
obviously<00:03:50.750> it's<00:03:50.900> dependent<00:03:51.440> on<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.620> size<00:03:51.800> of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
obviously it's dependent on the size of

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.730 
obviously it's dependent on the size of
the<00:03:52.100> kitchen<00:03:52.280> put<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.270> arranging<00:03:53.930> price<00:03:54.470> from

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
the kitchen put the arranging price from

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.590 
the kitchen put the arranging price from
two<00:03:54.980> thousand<00:03:55.520> seven<00:03:55.700> thousand<00:03:56.270> dollars

two thousand seven thousand dollars

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.440 
two thousand seven thousand dollars
again<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.530> depends<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.910> square<00:03:59.150> footage

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
again it depends on the square footage

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.330 
again it depends on the square footage
of<00:03:59.660> your<00:03:59.810> countertop<00:04:00.410> space<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.980> number<00:04:01.250> of

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
of your countertop space the number of

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.830 
of your countertop space the number of
cabinets<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.120> then<00:04:02.240> whether<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.630> go<00:04:02.810> with

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
cabinets and then whether you go with

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.230 
cabinets and then whether you go with
the<00:04:03.050> tile<00:04:03.260> backsplash<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.970> those<00:04:05.120> in
