00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
you know it's real easy to get stuck in

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.230 
you know it's real easy to get stuck in
the<00:00:08.010> exact<00:00:08.280> same<00:00:08.430> routine<00:00:08.790> because<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.120> don't

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the exact same routine because you don't

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.160 
the exact same routine because you don't
want<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> say

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
want to say

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.770 
want to say
do<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.380> exact<00:00:10.650> same<00:00:10.680> stuff<00:00:11.100> but<00:00:11.430> I<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.630> try

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
do the exact same stuff but I just try

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.650 
do the exact same stuff but I just try
to<00:00:12.840> add<00:00:12.960> one

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
to add one

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.000 
to add one
exercises<00:00:14.230> or<00:00:14.349> I'll<00:00:14.410> just<00:00:14.590> switch<00:00:14.769> it<00:00:14.920> up

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
exercises or I'll just switch it up

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.920 
exercises or I'll just switch it up
because<00:00:15.190> it's<00:00:15.400> always<00:00:15.610> good<00:00:16.029> to<00:00:16.330> shock<00:00:16.779> the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
because it's always good to shock the

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.710 
because it's always good to shock the
body<00:00:17.580> let<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:18.700> know<00:00:18.820> it<00:00:19.000> you<00:00:19.180> don't<00:00:19.330> want<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:19.630> to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
body let it know it you don't want it to

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.160 
body let it know it you don't want it to
get<00:00:19.840> used<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.110> anything<00:00:20.410> so<00:00:21.599> keep<00:00:22.599> it<00:00:22.750> guessing

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
get used to anything so keep it guessing

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.450 
get used to anything so keep it guessing
so<00:00:23.349> it<00:00:23.439> has<00:00:23.560> to<00:00:23.740> work

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
so it has to work

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.010 
so it has to work
and<00:00:25.060> you<00:00:25.270> don't<00:00:25.330> want<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.570> keep<00:00:25.660> hitting<00:00:25.900> just

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
and you don't want to keep hitting just

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.679 
and you don't want to keep hitting just
the<00:00:26.080> same<00:00:26.320> muscle<00:00:26.650> fibers<00:00:26.980> so<00:00:27.630> sometimes<00:00:28.630> I

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
the same muscle fibers so sometimes I

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.179 
the same muscle fibers so sometimes I
don't<00:00:28.840> even<00:00:28.900> know<00:00:29.110> what<00:00:29.290> like<00:00:29.500> muscle<00:00:29.890> fibers

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
don't even know what like muscle fibers

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.890 
don't even know what like muscle fibers
I'm<00:00:30.310> eating<00:00:30.550> I<00:00:30.640> just<00:00:30.820> know<00:00:30.939> that<00:00:31.090> if<00:00:31.420> I<00:00:31.720> hit

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
I'm eating I just know that if I hit

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.119 
I'm eating I just know that if I hit
different<00:00:32.050> angles<00:00:32.470> I'm<00:00:32.710> doing<00:00:32.949> something

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
different angles I'm doing something

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
different angles I'm doing something
different

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.360 

I'm<00:00:55.840> a<00:00:56.110> bodybuilder<00:00:56.410> call<00:00:57.010> myself<00:00:57.160> a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
I'm a bodybuilder call myself a

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.790 
I'm a bodybuilder call myself a
bodybuilder<00:00:58.110> um<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.260> know<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.379> like<00:00:59.559> lift

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
bodybuilder um you know I like lift

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.160 
bodybuilder um you know I like lift
heavy<00:01:00.010> weight<00:01:00.160> so<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.730> hit<00:01:01.570> those<00:01:01.690> type<00:01:01.960> ii

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
heavy weight so I hit those type ii

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.960 
heavy weight so I hit those type ii
fibers<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.829> I<00:01:02.920> needed<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.220> type<00:01:03.399> 1<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:03.850> know

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
fibers and I needed a type 1 you know

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.450 
fibers and I needed a type 1 you know
like<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.330> foundation<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.530> base<00:01:05.830> fibers

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
like the foundation of the base fibers

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.230 
like the foundation of the base fibers
so<00:01:07.420> these<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:09.460> like<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> fundamentals

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
so these this is like the fundamentals

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.100 
so these this is like the fundamentals
it's<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> great<00:01:11.320> way<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.470> warm<00:01:11.710> up<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.960> also

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
it's a great way to warm up it's also

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.749 
it's a great way to warm up it's also
what<00:01:14.290> people<00:01:14.320> do<00:01:14.619> go<00:01:14.830> together<00:01:14.890> for<00:01:15.490> injuries

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
what people do go together for injuries

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.660 
what people do go together for injuries
so<00:01:16.619> there's<00:01:17.619> no<00:01:17.770> one<00:01:17.920> man<00:01:18.100> how<00:01:18.250> would<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.490> just

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
so there's no one man how would you just

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.100 
so there's no one man how would you just
throw<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:18.909> some<00:01:19.090> heavy<00:01:19.240> weight<00:01:19.659> even<00:01:20.080> though

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
throw up some heavy weight even though

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.840 
throw up some heavy weight even though
I'm<00:01:20.259> too<00:01:20.440> tired<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:22.210> week<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:24.009> that<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.729> go

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
I'm too tired the week all that so go

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'm too tired the week all that so go
ahead<00:01:24.909> take<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.899> little<00:01:26.050> time<00:01:26.259> we<00:01:26.350> do<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:28.259> 25

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
ahead take a little time we do this 25

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.150 
ahead take a little time we do this 25
each<00:01:30.820> side<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.990> go<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.170> failure<00:01:32.440> on<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.860> you

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
each side you go to failure on this you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.340 
each side you go to failure on this you
don't<00:01:33.250> need<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.490> like<00:01:33.640> go<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.820> 25<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:35.170> when<00:01:35.259> you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
don't need to like go to 25 so when you

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.419 
don't need to like go to 25 so when you
go<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.470> failure<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.759> just<00:01:36.970> stop<00:01:38.369> wait<00:01:39.369> a

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
go to failure you just stop wait a

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.240 
go to failure you just stop wait a
couple<00:01:39.550> seconds<00:01:40.140> keep<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.350> humble<00:01:41.530> right<00:01:41.979> by

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
couple seconds keep it humble right by

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:52.540 
couple seconds keep it humble right by
the<00:01:42.310> body<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.940> do<00:01:46.060> external<00:01:46.600> rotation

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.140 

I<00:01:54.040> really<00:01:55.040> like<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.310> nice<00:01:55.640> shoulders

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
I really like to have nice shoulders

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.540 
I really like to have nice shoulders
that<00:01:56.750> was<00:01:56.930> my<00:01:57.110> weakest<00:01:57.710> part<00:01:58.040> when<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.220> first

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
that was my weakest part when I first

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.730 
that was my weakest part when I first
start<00:01:58.760> training<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.330> had<00:01:59.750> two<00:02:00.080> little<00:02:00.440> sticks

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
start training I had two little sticks

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.850 
start training I had two little sticks
and<00:02:01.010> I<00:02:01.040> had<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.310> do<00:02:01.460> rehabilitation<00:02:02.450> exercises

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
and I had to do rehabilitation exercises

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.580 
and I had to do rehabilitation exercises
but<00:02:03.860> obviously<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.340> progressed<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.390> do

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
but obviously I progressed and I do

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.190 
but obviously I progressed and I do
military<00:02:06.590> presses<00:02:07.190> with<00:02:07.520> dumbbells

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.150 

yeah

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:31.720 

I<00:02:18.220> do<00:02:18.970> side<00:02:19.300> lateral<00:02:19.750> raises

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.369 

and<00:02:32.730> also<00:02:32.939> what<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.299> do<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.599> put<00:02:33.810> my<00:02:33.930> mind<00:02:34.200> into

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
and also what I do is I put my mind into

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.949 
and also what I do is I put my mind into
my<00:02:34.560> workout<00:02:34.920> I'm<00:02:35.159> thinking<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.909> need<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.840> work

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
my workout I'm thinking I need to work

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.380 
my workout I'm thinking I need to work
the<00:02:37.109> front<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.859> middle<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.670> rear<00:02:38.879> delts

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the front the middle and the rear delts

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.050 
the front the middle and the rear delts
so<00:02:39.900> how<00:02:40.109> am<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.409> do<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.709> what<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.549> do<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.849> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
so how am I gonna do that what I do is I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.119 
so how am I gonna do that what I do is I
literally<00:02:42.599> use<00:02:42.959> different<00:02:43.500> angles<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
literally use different angles and

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.000 
literally use different angles and
slightly<00:02:44.700> vary<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.239> somebody<00:02:45.629> here<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.470> here

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
slightly vary it somebody here here here

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.309 
slightly vary it somebody here here here
here<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.090> different<00:02:48.239> angles<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.170> you

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
here all the different angles if you

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.440 
here all the different angles if you
think<00:02:49.530> about<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.890> full<00:02:50.310> though<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.269> work

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
think about the full though so I work

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.809 
think about the full though so I work
every<00:02:52.049> angle<00:02:52.409> it's<00:02:52.859> all<00:02:52.980> these<00:02:53.159> standing<00:02:53.609> side

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
every angle it's all these standing side

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.399 
every angle it's all these standing side
lateral<00:02:54.120> raises<00:02:54.329> I'll<00:02:54.629> go<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.989> front<00:02:55.260> with

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
lateral raises I'll go to the front with

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.890 
lateral raises I'll go to the front with
a<00:02:55.439> barbell<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.489> I'll<00:02:56.939> do<00:02:57.120> dumbbell<00:02:57.389> front

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
belt is balanced now let's talk about

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.599 
belt is balanced now let's talk about
biceps<00:03:13.769> biceps<00:03:14.760> same<00:03:15.480> thing<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:16.919> biceps<00:03:17.430> need

biceps biceps same thing the biceps need
to<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.819> hit<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.030> different<00:03:18.419> angles<00:03:18.930> here<00:03:19.709> here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to be hit in different angles here here

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.250 
to be hit in different angles here here
here<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.310> that's<00:03:21.269> how<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> try<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:21.989> work

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
here here that's how I try and work

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.569 
here here that's how I try and work
because<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.560> want<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.799> hit<00:03:22.950> here<00:03:23.280> when<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> hit

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
because I want to hit here when I hit

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.770 
because I want to hit here when I hit
the<00:03:23.700> middle<00:03:23.879> I<00:03:24.000> want<00:03:24.060> at<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.329> bottom<00:03:24.659> I<00:03:24.720> want

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the middle I want at the bottom I want

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.569 
the middle I want at the bottom I want
to<00:03:24.900> hit<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.079> outside<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.919> you<00:03:26.099> do<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.430> by

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
to hit the outside and you do that by

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.670 
to hit the outside and you do that by
using<00:03:26.760> different<00:03:27.239> hand<00:03:27.480> angles<00:03:27.900> different

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
using different hand angles different

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.339 
using different hand angles different
angles<00:03:29.010> with<00:03:29.159> the<00:03:29.189> arms<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.209> again<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.810> just<00:03:30.959> do

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
angles with the arms so again I just do

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.869 
angles with the arms so again I just do
different<00:03:31.530> angles<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.099> a<00:03:32.129> week<00:03:32.400> out<00:03:32.609> from<00:03:32.639> a

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
different angles and a week out from a

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.580 
different angles and a week out from a
show<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:33.780> said<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.109> gonna<00:03:34.229> be<00:03:34.319> lighter

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
show like I said it's gonna be lighter

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.649 
show like I said it's gonna be lighter
weight<00:03:34.799> it's<00:03:34.949> 12<00:03:35.159> to<00:03:35.250> 15<00:03:35.609> reps<00:03:35.940> but<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.359> want<00:03:36.599> to

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
weight it's 12 to 15 reps but I want to

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:51.130 
weight it's 12 to 15 reps but I want to
get<00:03:36.720> injured

know and I also scan straight up I see a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.250 
know and I also scan straight up I see a
lot<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.120> people<00:03:59.240> lean<00:03:59.540> over<00:03:59.810> you're<00:03:59.959> not<00:04:00.080> using

forcing the full muscle to work and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.059 
forcing the full muscle to work and
that's<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.990> correct<00:04:06.200> form<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:06.800> stand

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
so I hit the upper and lower abs so you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.930 
so I hit the upper and lower abs so you
either<00:05:38.400> go<00:05:38.610> longer<00:05:39.200> you<00:05:40.200> do<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.950> more<00:05:41.100> often<00:05:41.520> or

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
either go longer you do it more often or

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.400 
either go longer you do it more often or
you<00:05:42.000> raise<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.510> intensity<00:05:42.840> so<00:05:43.110> that's<00:05:43.260> either

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
you raise the intensity so that's either

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.890 
you raise the intensity so that's either
going<00:05:43.650> faster<00:05:44.070> or<00:05:44.280> raise<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.670> incline<00:05:44.940> so

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
going faster or raise the incline so

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.320 
going faster or raise the incline so
here<00:05:46.080> we<00:05:46.140> go

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:06:01.119
