are<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> good<00:04:05.510> choice<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:06.110> they<00:04:06.290> keep<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.590> off

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710

the<00:04:06.860> mini-map<00:04:07.100> while<00:04:07.220> firing<00:04:07.880> the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
the mini-map while firing the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.270 
the mini-map while firing the
disadvantage<00:04:08.960> is<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.560> slows<00:04:09.950> down<00:04:10.160> your

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
disadvantage is it slows down your

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.920 
disadvantage is it slows down your
muzzle<00:04:10.430> velocity<00:04:10.940> which<00:04:11.120> will<00:04:11.210> make<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.540> have

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
muzzle velocity which will make you have

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.300 
muzzle velocity which will make you have
to<00:04:11.960> lead<00:04:12.230> your<00:04:12.260> shots<00:04:12.440> against<00:04:12.920> enemies

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
to lead your shots against enemies

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.330 
to lead your shots against enemies
moving<00:04:13.840> perpendicular<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.200> even<00:04:15.920> at<00:04:16.040> 5

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
moving perpendicular to you even at 5

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.000 
moving perpendicular to you even at 5
meters<00:04:16.760> or<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.810> I'd<00:04:18.230> actually<00:04:18.770> recommend

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
meters or so so I'd actually recommend

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.310 
meters or so so I'd actually recommend
running<00:04:19.760> with<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.000> flash<00:04:20.450> hider<00:04:20.750> instead

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
running with the flash hider instead

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.900 
running with the flash hider instead
there's<00:04:21.590> no<00:04:21.710> disadvantage<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.430> using<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.790> and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
there's no disadvantage to using it and

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.330 
there's no disadvantage to using it and
it<00:04:23.120> will

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
it will

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.159 
it will
make<00:04:23.520> tracking<00:04:24.210> targets<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.870> low-light

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
make tracking targets and low-light

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.290 
make tracking targets and low-light
environments<00:04:25.199> much<00:04:25.889> easier<00:04:26.430> since<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.090> won't
