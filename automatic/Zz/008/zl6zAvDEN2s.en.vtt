the opener with Denver one point one

the opener with Denver one point one
point<00:00:48.870> oh<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.850> Buffalo's<00:00:51.620> offensive

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
point oh I think if Buffalo's offensive

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
point oh I think if Buffalo's offensive
coordinator<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.250> play<00:00:53.550> pool<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:53.879> whatever

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
coordinator or play pool or whatever

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.360 
coordinator or play pool or whatever
just<00:00:55.489> puts<00:00:56.489> together<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.090> sustained<00:00:57.750> drive

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
just puts together a sustained drive

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
just puts together a sustained drive
late<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> fourth<00:00:59.940> order<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.539> both<00:01:00.750> those

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
late in the fourth order in both those

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
late in the fourth order in both those
games<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> score<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
games that it doesn't have to score just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
games that it doesn't have to score just

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
take some point just take some some time

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.700

off the clock and you win those games

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.210 
off the clock and you win those games

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
touchdowns six turnovers it a great

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539

great performance with with turnovers

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
great performance with with turnovers
and<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> buckling<00:01:34.860> down<00:01:35.070> when

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and and just really a buckling down when

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.770 
and and just really a buckling down when
they<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.520> suit<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> defense<00:01:36.420> did

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
they had suit I think the defense did

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.350 
they had suit I think the defense did
that<00:01:36.960> tonight<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.500> can't<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.340> pin<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that tonight I can't really pin this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.929 
that tonight I can't really pin this
loss<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.500> defense<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:41.850> or

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
loss on the defense I think it's more or

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.840 
loss on the defense I think it's more or
less<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:43.200> Buffalo<00:01:43.640> had<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
less see when Buffalo had the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.679 
less see when Buffalo had the
opportunity<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.470> Jew<00:01:46.619> Giorgio

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
opportunity with the Jew Giorgio

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.899 
opportunity with the Jew Giorgio
interception<00:01:48.689> following<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.909> Edwards

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
interception following the Edwards

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
interception following the Edwards
interception<00:01:51.479> which<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> tipped<00:01:52.290> ball<00:01:52.350> by

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
interception which was a tipped ball by

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
interception which was a tipped ball by
the<00:01:53.040> way<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> line<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.090> wasn't<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the way at the line it really wasn't a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.600 
the way at the line it really wasn't a
dead-on<00:01:55.110> pick<00:01:55.619> where<00:01:55.920> he<00:01:56.040> who<00:01:56.310> would<00:01:56.460> dump

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
dead-on pick where he who would dump

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
dead-on pick where he who would dump
pass<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.149> was<00:01:57.270> more<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.570> less<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> tip<00:01:58.049> pass<00:01:58.290> at

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
pass it was more or less a tip pass at

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.200 
pass it was more or less a tip pass at
the<00:01:58.920> line<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> think<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> market

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the line I think the market

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.520 
the line I think the market
where<00:02:00.360> might<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.690> tipped<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.140> Dallas

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
where might have tipped it for Dallas

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.390 
where might have tipped it for Dallas
and<00:02:02.600> was<00:02:03.600> run<00:02:03.869> back<00:02:04.080> but<00:02:04.440> they<00:02:04.890> had<00:02:05.280> an

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and was run back but they had an

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.180 
and was run back but they had an
opportunity<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.840> give<00:02:07.710> Dallas

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
opportunity there to really give Dallas

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.020 
opportunity there to really give Dallas
a<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> problem<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.400> they<00:02:11.400> end<00:02:11.850> up

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
interesting off week for Buffalo again I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.940 
interesting off week for Buffalo again I
think<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.380> get<00:03:40.590> healthier<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:42.530> get<00:03:43.530> lineart

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
think to get healthier to get lineart

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.590 
think to get healthier to get lineart
back<00:03:44.190> gives<00:03:44.700> them<00:03:44.880> more<00:03:45.030> depth<00:03:45.329> in<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
back gives them more depth in the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.080 
back gives them more depth in the
secondary<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.549> believe<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.579> think<00:03:47.970> they're

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
secondary I believe I think they're

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.780 
secondary I believe I think they're
going<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> another<00:03:49.140> player<00:03:49.530> back<00:03:49.799> on

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
going to get a another player back on

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.190 
going to get a another player back on
defense<00:03:51.620> more<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:52.709> less<00:03:52.769> coy<00:03:53.609> wire<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:55.049> guy

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
defense more or less coy wire is the guy

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.720 
defense more or less coy wire is the guy
that<00:03:55.230> I'm<00:03:55.500> thinking<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.040> also<00:03:56.400> helped<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
that I'm thinking of it also helped the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.180 
that I'm thinking of it also helped the
special<00:03:57.120> teams<00:03:57.359> out<00:03:57.650> because<00:03:58.650> he's<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.829> really

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
special teams out because he's a really

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.069 
special teams out because he's a really
good<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.579> special<00:04:00.299> teams<00:04:00.450> player<00:04:00.720> reserve

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
good of special teams player reserve

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.390 
good of special teams player reserve
linebacker<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.739> think<00:04:01.980> they'll<00:04:02.130> address

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
linebacker and I think they'll address

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.670 
linebacker and I think they'll address
the<00:04:02.700> wide<00:04:02.910> receiver<00:04:03.390> position<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:04.200> as<00:04:04.470> we

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
the wide receiver position because as we

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.590 
the wide receiver position because as we
all<00:04:04.709> know<00:04:04.829> peerless<00:04:05.340> price

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
be a good performance but you know two

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.130 
be a good performance but you know two
games<00:04:50.970> against<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.390> dolphins<00:04:51.840> which<00:04:51.990> are

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
games against the dolphins which are

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.780 
games against the dolphins which are
very<00:04:52.290> winnable<00:04:52.650> another<00:04:53.070> game<00:04:53.310> against<00:04:53.700> the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
very winnable another game against the

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.920 
very winnable another game against the
jets<00:04:54.060> which<00:04:54.240> is<00:04:54.390> very<00:04:54.660> winnable<00:04:54.990> there's<00:04:56.930> you

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
jets which is very winnable there's you

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.400 
jets which is very winnable there's you
know<00:04:57.990> they<00:04:58.200> could<00:04:58.380> be<00:04:58.410> four<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:58.830> four<00:04:59.190> and

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
know they could be four and four and

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.840 
know they could be four and four and
from<00:05:01.410> there<00:05:01.620> who<00:05:01.920> knows<00:05:01.950> what<00:05:02.340> could<00:05:02.460> happen<00:05:02.610> I

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
from there who knows what could happen I

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.450 
from there who knows what could happen I
just<00:05:03.270> think<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.590> play-calling<00:05:05.130> at<00:05:05.340> the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
just think that the play-calling at the

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.010 
just think that the play-calling at the
end<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.760> game<00:05:05.790> more<00:05:06.570> or<00:05:06.660> less<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
end of the game more or less in the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.600 
end of the game more or less in the
second<00:05:07.440> half<00:05:07.620> needs<00:05:07.950> to<00:05:08.130> be<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> little<00:05:08.520> bit

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
second half needs to be a little bit

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.760 
second half needs to be a little bit
more<00:05:08.850> aggressive<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:10.230> little<00:05:10.470> bit<00:05:10.560> more

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
more aggressive and a little bit more

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.140 
more aggressive and a little bit more
straightforward<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.580> think<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.850> was<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.970> little

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
straightforward I think it was a little

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.610 
straightforward I think it was a little
too<00:05:12.330> gimmicky<00:05:12.630> tonight<00:05:13.140> they<00:05:13.290> got<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.470> little

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
too gimmicky tonight they got a little

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.860 
too gimmicky tonight they got a little
too<00:05:13.890> cute<00:05:14.670> with<00:05:14.730> some<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.240> reverses<00:05:15.840> and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
too cute with some of the reverses and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.380 
too cute with some of the reverses and
one<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.920> short<00:05:17.370> yardage<00:05:17.730> plays<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:18.210> lead

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
one of the short yardage plays that lead

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.060 
one of the short yardage plays that lead
was<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.600> third<00:05:18.900> down<00:05:19.110> or<00:05:19.350> second<00:05:19.680> down<00:05:19.800> short

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
was a third down or second down short

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.700 
was a third down or second down short
yardage<00:05:20.310> play<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:21.230> Dallas<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.350> side<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.560> the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
yardage play on Dallas the side of the

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.870 
yardage play on Dallas the side of the
field<00:05:22.920> I<00:05:23.160> thought<00:05:23.370> they<00:05:23.520> should<00:05:23.550> have<00:05:23.760> just

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
field I thought they should have just

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.550 
field I thought they should have just
hammered<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.450> in<00:05:24.540> with<00:05:24.720> Marshall<00:05:25.200> and<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.320> think

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
hammered it in with Marshall and I think

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.960 
hammered it in with Marshall and I think
that<00:05:25.710> was<00:05:25.890> where<00:05:26.070> they<00:05:26.160> ran<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.460> reverse<00:05:26.790> with

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
that was where they ran the reverse with

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.140 
that was where they ran the reverse with
Roscoe<00:05:27.450> but<00:05:27.720> I<00:05:28.400> just<00:05:29.400> think<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.700> needs<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:30.030> get

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
Roscoe but I just think it needs to get

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.660 
Roscoe but I just think it needs to get
a<00:05:30.180> little<00:05:30.330> bit<00:05:30.540> more<00:05:30.660> simple<00:05:30.930> flied<00:05:31.290> and<00:05:31.670> just

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
a little bit more simple flied and just

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.730 
a little bit more simple flied and just
you<00:05:33.150> know<00:05:33.180> that's<00:05:33.870> why<00:05:34.080> they<00:05:34.230> upgraded<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
you know that's why they upgraded the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.920 
you know that's why they upgraded the
offensive<00:05:35.040> line<00:05:35.220> got<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> lot<00:05:35.700> bigger<00:05:35.930> push

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
offensive line got a lot bigger push

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.260 
offensive line got a lot bigger push
forward<00:05:37.380> hopefully<00:05:38.010> Brad<00:05:38.250> Butler<00:05:38.610> wasn't<00:05:38.970> to

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
I think so I don't think teams will be

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.230 
I think so I don't think teams will be
