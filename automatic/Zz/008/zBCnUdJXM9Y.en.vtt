 Here is what we introduce today 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.619
 It is Alstroemeria that I think that there are many people who know it 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.470

 I many things by the day-to-day mouth Fu Toka I color 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.980
 The language of flowers is I think that to have kept different 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 Also, it is different to say that the flower language is written in this flower language encyclopedia completely like this 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.930
 Mare 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.470
 Besides this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.820
 Private opinion 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.710
 Yellow pe off 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.850
 Tarp 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.470
 Water orange 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:40.070
 In addition to the kind of color, such as we are watching now 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:43.610
 There are more and more colors in more and more flowers that have many colors 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:48.470
 It is developed variously because it is popular 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:54.740
 It is as point that this wing can be 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:59.100
 What is it with this? I understand that flowers are attached to all directions 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:05.070
 Well this old-fashioned burial mound and the directionality is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.050
 It is also this 12 because You're'm not established, for example, there is this now 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.479
 Less cute and less 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:17.569
 Do you have any direction etc. 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:22.249
 If this is attached, it will turn to both directions 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:30.100
 Natural to this angle and so I think you can make it easier with the mouth 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:31.500
 Then arrangements by clearly beautiful than Dewakariyasuku you go there is a form 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.630

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.490
