who would like to build one this is the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
who would like to build one this is the
finished<00:00:13.110> metal<00:00:13.349> max<00:00:13.679> kit<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.309> i<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.429> got

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
finished metal max kit that i just got

finished metal max kit that i just got
done<00:00:14.940> building<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.660> see<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.820> little<00:00:20.820> bit

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
done building you can see a little bit

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.810 
done building you can see a little bit
right<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.650> that's<00:00:22.650> sticking<00:00:23.250> out<00:00:23.460> but

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
right here that's sticking out but

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
right here that's sticking out but
that's<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> hurt<00:00:25.140> anything<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.680> all

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that's not going to hurt anything at all

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
that's not going to hurt anything at all
they<00:00:26.130> also<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.910> Thingiverse<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.779> make<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
they also on Thingiverse they make a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.870 
they also on Thingiverse they make a
little<00:00:28.609> plug<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> end<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.630> those

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
little plug to put in the end of those

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.200 
little plug to put in the end of those
as<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.420> two<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:34.670> from<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:35.880> here

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
as you can see two from from down here

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
as you can see two from from down here
the<00:00:36.420> spacing<00:00:36.930> between<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.320> smooth<00:00:37.739> rod<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the spacing between the smooth rod and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.770 
the spacing between the smooth rod and
the<00:00:38.280> all<00:00:38.399> thread<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:40.129> good<00:00:41.360> there's<00:00:42.360> there's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the all thread is good there's there's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.490 
the all thread is good there's there's
no<00:00:42.960> variation<00:00:44.629> all<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.710> use<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
no variation all the way up so i use the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.900 
no variation all the way up so i use the
hall<00:00:52.500> effect<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:53.219> stops<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.879> work<00:00:57.030> fine

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
hall effect in stops and they work fine

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.529 
hall effect in stops and they work fine
everything<00:00:59.910> went<00:01:00.420> together<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:02.539> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
everything went together really well the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.090 
everything went together really well the
height<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:05.330> feet<00:01:06.770> was<00:01:07.770> good<00:01:08.180> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
height of the feet was good and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.609 
height of the feet was good and
everything<00:01:11.100> fit<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:12.140> didn't<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> file

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
everything fit I didn't have to file

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.340 
everything fit I didn't have to file
anything<00:01:14.930> or<00:01:15.930> grind<00:01:16.259> anything<00:01:16.710> i<00:01:17.420> used<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> GT

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
anything or grind anything i used the GT

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
anything or grind anything i used the GT
two<00:01:20.420> pulleys<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> belts

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.820 

 display<00:01:31.290> still<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.530> print

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830

Manning<00:01:33.670> for<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:36.040> as<00:01:36.190> far<00:01:36.400> as<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.880> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
Manning for that but as far as the the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.580 
Manning for that but as far as the the
built<00:01:37.960> goes<00:01:40.140> everything<00:01:41.140> went<00:01:41.470> together

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
built goes everything went together

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:52.260 
built goes everything went together
beautifully<00:01:44.910> tension<00:01:45.910> air<00:01:48.840> works<00:01:49.840> fine<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.850> to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
in stock for the z-axis aluminum plate

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.859 
in stock for the z-axis aluminum plate
to<00:01:56.500> mount<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:57.360> heated<00:01:58.360> bed<00:01:58.540> on<00:01:58.780> and<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.600> dell

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
to mount the heated bed on and the dell

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:10.020 
to mount the heated bed on and the dell
power<00:02:02.200> supply<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:07.740> arduino<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.700> ramps

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
power supply the arduino and the ramps

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.840 
power supply the arduino and the ramps
board<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.500> course<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.920> drivers<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
board and of course the drivers for the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.750 
board and of course the drivers for the
steppers<00:02:13.590> being<00:02:14.590> cooled<00:02:14.920> by<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.160> little<00:02:15.520> fan

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
steppers being cooled by the little fan

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
steppers being cooled by the little fan
here

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:32.929 

so<00:02:23.599> everything<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:27.349> working<00:02:29.510> my<00:02:31.939> newly

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
so everything is a working my newly

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:41.449 
so everything is a working my newly
designed<00:02:33.150> hot<00:02:33.659> end<00:02:36.319> functions<00:02:37.319> very<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:40.459> of

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
designed hot end functions very well of

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:52.820 
designed hot end functions very well of
course<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> wiring<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.510> see<00:02:45.810> yo

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.490 

and<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.550> used<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:55.640> archambault<00:02:56.640> cord<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.930> hook<00:02:58.200> up

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
and I used a archambault cord to hook up

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:09.020 
and I used a archambault cord to hook up
the<00:02:58.940> heat<00:02:59.940> in<00:02:59.970> bed

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.950 

so

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.730 

everything's<00:03:13.960> together<00:03:16.200> no<00:03:17.200> problems

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
everything's together no problems

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.630 
everything's together no problems
putting<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.250> together<00:03:20.430> everything<00:03:21.430> works

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
putting it together everything works

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.830 
putting it together everything works
fine<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:23.160> used<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:25.350> plastic<00:03:27.030> cut<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.210> a<00:03:28.240> piece<00:03:28.540> of

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
fine I used a plastic cut out a piece of

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.100 
fine I used a plastic cut out a piece of
quarter<00:03:29.710> inch<00:03:29.830> plastic<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:31.690> mount<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
quarter inch plastic to mount the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.270 
quarter inch plastic to mount the
electronics<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.840> back<00:03:35.050> we<00:03:35.830> see<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.220> all

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
electronics on the back we see it all

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.940 
electronics on the back we see it all
here<00:03:36.670> drill<00:03:37.660> holes<00:03:37.960> for<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.290> wires<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.800> go

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
here drill holes for the wires to go

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.640 
here drill holes for the wires to go
through

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.280 

and<00:03:49.069> my<00:03:49.459> little<00:03:52.269> hack<00:03:53.269> for<00:03:53.689> the<00:03:53.750> dell<00:03:53.930> power

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
and my little hack for the dell power

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.220 
and my little hack for the dell power
supply<00:03:55.180> works<00:03:56.180> very<00:03:56.480> well<00:03:56.599> I<00:03:58.569> did<00:03:59.569> not<00:03:59.599> put<00:04:00.019> a

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
supply works very well I did not put a

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.039 
supply works very well I did not put a
relay<00:04:00.739> on<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.189> heated<00:04:01.730> bed<00:04:01.970> because<00:04:02.870> it

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
relay on this heated bed because it

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.080 
relay on this heated bed because it
pulls<00:04:03.260> less<00:04:03.560> than<00:04:03.970> 10<00:04:04.970> amps<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:07.090> Arduino

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
pulls less than 10 amps and the Arduino

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.390 
pulls less than 10 amps and the Arduino
can<00:04:08.480> handle<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:08.989> or<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.349> ramps<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:10.010> handle

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
can handle that or the ramps can handle

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.759 
can handle that or the ramps can handle
that<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.900> that's<00:04:12.349> what<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.950> did<00:04:13.040> there<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:15.620> guy

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
that so that's what I did there the guy

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.830 
that so that's what I did there the guy
built<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.280> for<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.940> going<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.389> go<00:04:17.539> ahead<00:04:17.600> and

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
built this for is going to go ahead and

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.200 
built this for is going to go ahead and
use<00:04:17.989> Marlin<00:04:18.560> or<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:19.280> Marlin<00:04:20.120> software<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:22.210> use

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
use Marlin or a Marlin software and use

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.610 
use Marlin or a Marlin software and use
the<00:04:23.770> display<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.830> run<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.280> without<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the display to run it without the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.000 
the display to run it without the
computer<00:04:27.620> or<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.889> USB<00:04:28.430> port<00:04:28.460> hooked<00:04:29.000> up<00:04:30.010> so

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
computer or the USB port hooked up so

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.300 
computer or the USB port hooked up so
he's<00:04:31.460> going<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.880> use<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.510> SD<00:04:33.470> card<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:37.100> run

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
he's going to use the SD card to run

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.150 
he's going to use the SD card to run
this<00:04:37.490> thing<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.580> Marlon<00:04:40.580> uses<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.300> pulse<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.860> run

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
this thing so Marlon uses a pulse to run

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.020 
this thing so Marlon uses a pulse to run
the<00:04:43.310> heated<00:04:43.639> bed<00:04:44.889> instead<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.099> a<00:04:46.190> constant<00:04:46.789> 12

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
the heated bed instead of a constant 12

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.680 
the heated bed instead of a constant 12
volts<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:49.310> that's<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.000> reason<00:04:50.030> for<00:04:50.509> not<00:04:50.660> using

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
volts so that's the reason for not using

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.010 
volts so that's the reason for not using
the<00:04:51.139> relay<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:52.660> know<00:04:53.660> there<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:55.000> way<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.030> shut

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
the relay I know there is a way to shut

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.520 
the relay I know there is a way to shut
that<00:04:57.229> off<00:04:57.289> the<00:04:58.190> pulse<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> have<00:05:00.289> not

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
that off the pulse but I have not

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.149 
that off the pulse but I have not
figured<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:01.070> out<00:05:01.099> yet<00:05:02.470> I'm<00:05:03.470> sure<00:05:03.740> somebody

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
figured that out yet I'm sure somebody

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.899 
figured that out yet I'm sure somebody
can<00:05:04.250> tell<00:05:04.669> me<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.770> that's<00:05:07.010> that's<00:05:07.490> where<00:05:07.760> this

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
can tell me but that's that's where this

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:16.390 
can tell me but that's that's where this
is<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:09.199> a<00:05:10.270> mental<00:05:11.270> max<00:05:12.550> 1.5<00:05:14.889> so<00:05:15.889> if

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
is that it's a mental max 1.5 so if

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.300 
is that it's a mental max 1.5 so if
anybody's<00:05:16.940> interested

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.930
