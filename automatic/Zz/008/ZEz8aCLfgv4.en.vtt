in 4k or say 1080p at 60fps are these

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.890 
in 4k or say 1080p at 60fps are these
are<00:01:03.310> same<00:01:03.490> types<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.910> functions<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.420> have<00:01:04.629> to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
are same types of functions I have to

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.330 
are same types of functions I have to
control<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.379> camera<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.009> inspire

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
control this camera on the inspire

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.890 
control this camera on the inspire
that's<00:01:06.700> exactly<00:01:06.909> right<00:01:07.180> it's<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.659> exact<00:01:07.869> same

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
that's exactly right it's the exact same

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.929 
that's exactly right it's the exact same
camera<00:01:08.500> with<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.740> same<00:01:08.950> functions<00:01:09.400> but<00:01:09.729> just

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
camera with the same functions but just

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.760 
camera with the same functions but just
brought<00:01:10.119> into<00:01:10.509> a<00:01:10.540> handheld<00:01:10.960> function<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:11.740> that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
brought into a handheld function so that

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.039 
brought into a handheld function so that
as<00:01:12.100> you're<00:01:12.640> moving<00:01:12.790> around<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.719> don't<00:01:13.749> have

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
as you're moving around you don't have

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.319 
as you're moving around you don't have
to<00:01:14.200> use<00:01:14.859> two<00:01:14.890> different<00:01:15.340> cameras<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.060> get<00:01:16.210> the

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
to use two different cameras to get the

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.359 
to use two different cameras to get the
same<00:01:16.450> shot<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.170> notice<00:01:17.469> that<00:01:17.679> your<00:01:17.920> motions

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
same shot and I notice that your motions

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.709 
same shot and I notice that your motions
are<00:01:18.520> pretty<00:01:18.700> cool<00:01:18.909> can<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.270> show<00:01:19.479> us<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.630> little

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
are pretty cool can you show us a little

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.599 
are pretty cool can you show us a little
bit<00:01:19.899> of<00:01:19.990> how<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.170> can<00:01:20.289> move<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:21.130> course<00:01:21.310> so

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
bit of how it can move of course so

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.039 
bit of how it can move of course so
right<00:01:21.820> now<00:01:21.850> it's<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.390> what's<00:01:22.630> called<00:01:22.749> smooth

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
right now it's in what's called smooth

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.690 
right now it's in what's called smooth
track<00:01:23.289> mode<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.100> means<00:01:24.280> that's<00:01:24.490> going

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
track mode and that means that's going

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.819 
track mode and that means that's going
to<00:01:24.789> follow<00:01:24.969> my<00:01:25.329> emotions<00:01:25.810> as<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.469> move<00:01:26.679> the

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
to follow my emotions as I move the

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.130 
to follow my emotions as I move the
camera<00:01:27.009> around<00:01:27.179> but<00:01:28.179> then<00:01:28.329> if<00:01:28.539> I<00:01:28.689> want<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:28.990> say

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
camera around but then if I want to say

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.770 
camera around but then if I want to say
follow<00:01:29.799> something<00:01:30.310> dynamic<00:01:30.520> but<00:01:31.149> i<00:01:31.329> wanted<00:01:31.630> to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
follow something dynamic but i wanted to

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.440 
follow something dynamic but i wanted to
say<00:01:31.960> locked<00:01:32.350> in<00:01:32.499> the<00:01:32.590> same<00:01:32.799> angle<00:01:33.310> i<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:34.060> use<00:01:34.240> a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
say locked in the same angle i can use a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.319 
say locked in the same angle i can use a
locked<00:01:34.719> mode<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.679> no<00:01:36.069> matter<00:01:36.189> how<00:01:36.460> i<00:01:36.759> rotate

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
locked mode so no matter how i rotate

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.149 
locked mode so no matter how i rotate
the<00:01:37.479> camera<00:01:37.659> around<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.710> going<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:38.979> say

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the camera around it's going to say

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.160 
the camera around it's going to say
pointing<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:39.880> same<00:01:39.909> direction<00:01:40.090> all<00:01:40.869> of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
pointing in the same direction all of
