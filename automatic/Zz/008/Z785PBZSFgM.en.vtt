compression test is because if the

time you don't get your plug wires cross

time you don't get your plug wires cross
then<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.409> will<00:00:57.530> be<00:00:57.619> out<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:58.010> fire<00:00:58.159> in<00:00:58.250> order

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
then it will be out of the fire in order

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:59.770 
then it will be out of the fire in order
to<00:00:58.460> be<00:00:58.519> out<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.670> whack<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.119> it<00:00:59.449> won't<00:00:59.629> run

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
to be out of whack and it won't run

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.930 
to be out of whack and it won't run
right<00:00:59.989> either<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.949> I'm<00:01:01.400> just<00:01:01.549> going<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.729> start

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
right either so I'm just going to start

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.250 
right either so I'm just going to start
with<00:01:02.089> number<00:01:02.269> two<00:01:02.510> because<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:02.839> closest<00:01:03.140> to

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
with number two because it's closest to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.740 
with number two because it's closest to
me<00:01:03.379> pull<00:01:04.309> your<00:01:04.400> plug<00:01:04.519> wire<00:01:04.790> off<00:01:07.090> socket<00:01:08.090> on<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
me pull your plug wire off socket on the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:21.010 
me pull your plug wire off socket on the
smartboard<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.320> break<00:01:12.860> those<00:01:13.310> loose

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.300 

and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.230> next<00:01:22.410> step<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.010> be<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and the next step is going to be the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.570 
and the next step is going to be the
threat<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.420> compression<00:01:24.750> testing<00:01:25.580> when

threat in the compression testing when

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:41.489 
threat in the compression testing when
we<00:01:26.640> roll<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> over<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.810> get

as you roll it over you'll see the
needle<00:02:05.170> bounce<00:02:05.349> that's<00:02:05.799> when<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.099> cylinder

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
needle bounce that's when the cylinder

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.130 
needle bounce that's when the cylinder
is<00:02:06.459> coming<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.789> valves<00:02:07.719> are<00:02:07.840> closed<00:02:07.959> that's

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
is coming up valves are closed that's

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.570 
is coming up valves are closed that's
when<00:02:08.259> everything's<00:02:08.530> happening<00:02:08.920> usually

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
when everything's happening usually

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.670 
when everything's happening usually
balanced<00:02:09.849> probably<00:02:10.149> five<00:02:10.330> six<00:02:10.599> times<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.530> will

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
balanced probably five six times it will

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.830 
balanced probably five six times it will
stop<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.220> that's<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:13.599> your

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
stop and that's that's that's your

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:24.000 
stop and that's that's that's your
reading<00:02:14.079> for<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.290> cylinder<00:02:22.769> yeah<00:02:23.769> by<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
reading for that cylinder yeah by the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.009 
reading for that cylinder yeah by the
six<00:02:24.340> roll<00:02:24.549> over<00:02:24.819> it's<00:02:25.390> good<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:25.840> I'm

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
six roll over it's good to go I'm

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.660 
six roll over it's good to go I'm
sitting<00:02:26.290> at<00:02:26.349> 130<00:02:26.829> pounds<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.310> number<00:02:27.340> two

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
sitting at 130 pounds on number two

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.170 
sitting at 130 pounds on number two
cylinder<00:02:29.250> okay<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.400> button<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.819> all<00:02:30.940> back<00:02:31.150> up

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
cylinder okay now button it all back up

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.900 
cylinder okay now button it all back up
and<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:32.319> compression<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.829> I<00:02:32.980> got<00:02:33.220> across

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
and the compression that I got across

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.420 
and the compression that I got across
the<00:02:34.090> board<00:02:34.269> was<00:02:34.450> 130<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.109> expected<00:02:35.769> that<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the board was 130 I expected that it's a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.349 
the board was 130 I expected that it's a
new<00:02:36.549> motor<00:02:38.010> warning<00:02:39.010> signs<00:02:39.250> would<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:39.579> say<00:02:40.299> you

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
new motor warning signs would be say you

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.430 
new motor warning signs would be say you
have<00:02:40.599> 130<00:02:41.170> 130<00:02:41.859> 125<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.090> then<00:02:43.150> 90<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:44.109> that's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
have 130 130 125 and then 90 that that's

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.809 
have 130 130 125 and then 90 that that's
why<00:02:44.620> you're<00:02:44.769> testing<00:02:45.129> compression<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.639> lets

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
why you're testing compression that lets

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.069 
why you're testing compression that lets
you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:45.970> what's<00:02:46.299> going<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.660> with<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> top

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
you know what's going on with the top

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.660 
you know what's going on with the top
end<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.410> motor<00:02:47.500> if<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.310> were<00:02:48.400> at<00:02:48.489> that

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
end of the motor if you were at that

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.180 
end of the motor if you were at that
point<00:02:48.910> you'd<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.299> problem<00:02:49.980> first<00:02:50.980> thing

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
point you'd have a problem first thing

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800 
point you'd have a problem first thing
you<00:02:51.250> would<00:02:51.370> check<00:02:51.549> is<00:02:51.700> your<00:02:51.880> valves<00:02:52.269> make<00:02:52.660> sure

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you would check is your valves make sure

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.059 
you would check is your valves make sure
your<00:02:52.930> head<00:02:53.079> isn't<00:02:53.230> leaking<00:02:53.590> where<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.859> jug

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
your head isn't leaking where the jug

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.830 
your head isn't leaking where the jug
meets<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.489> that's<00:02:54.940> those<00:02:55.359> reasons<00:02:55.750> you'll

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
meets it that's those reasons you'll

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.780 
meets it that's those reasons you'll
notice<00:02:56.139> compression<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.130> when<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.370> runs<00:02:57.549> that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
notice compression but when it runs that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
notice compression but when it runs that
when<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.239> when<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.690> compression<00:02:58.959> numbers<00:02:59.349> are

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
when it when the compression numbers are

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.229 
when it when the compression numbers are
running<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.829> that<00:02:59.859> it's<00:03:00.400> not<00:03:00.609> going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.849> be<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
running like that it's not going to be a

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.159 
running like that it's not going to be a
very<00:03:01.750> smooth<00:03:02.200> running<00:03:02.590> engine<00:03:02.919> if<00:03:03.250> at<00:03:03.489> all<00:03:04.169> you

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
very smooth running engine if at all you

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.500 
very smooth running engine if at all you
