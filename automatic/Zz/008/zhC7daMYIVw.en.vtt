our<00:02:20.120> world<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.459> fragile

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.570 

we<00:02:31.000> are<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.330> point<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.900> light<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.830> universe<00:02:33.370> of

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
we are a point of light in a universe of

shadow a candle in a tempest sometimes I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.470 
shadow a candle in a tempest sometimes I
think<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.530> was<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.710> very<00:02:39.030> precariousness<00:02:40.030> of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
think it was the very precariousness of
