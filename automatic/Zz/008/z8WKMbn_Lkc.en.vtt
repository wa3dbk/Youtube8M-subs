for<00:00:23.649> the<00:00:24.039> first<00:00:24.310> few<00:00:24.519> outlets<00:00:24.849> and<00:00:25.689> then<00:00:26.019> I'll

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
for the first few outlets and then I'll

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.849 
for the first few outlets and then I'll
plug<00:00:26.409> my<00:00:26.589> pumps<00:00:27.579> into<00:00:27.729> there<00:00:28.019> along<00:00:29.019> with<00:00:29.050> the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
plug my pumps into there along with the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.230 
plug my pumps into there along with the
next<00:00:30.460> four<00:00:30.789> outlets<00:00:31.830> will<00:00:32.830> be<00:00:33.040> various<00:00:33.970> pump

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
next four outlets will be various pump

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.610 
next four outlets will be various pump
to<00:00:34.360> know<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.600> main<00:00:34.780> return<00:00:35.080> pump<00:00:35.380> those

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
to know the main return pump those

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.020 
to know the main return pump those
gamebut<00:00:36.610> pump<00:00:36.880> you<00:00:37.870> know<00:00:38.050> what<00:00:39.040> does<00:00:39.160> my<00:00:39.730> UV

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
gamebut pump you know what does my UV

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.340 
gamebut pump you know what does my UV
sterilizer<00:00:40.450> pump<00:00:40.750> and<00:00:40.900> a<00:00:40.930> couple<00:00:41.200> other

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
sterilizer pump and a couple other

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.530 
sterilizer pump and a couple other
things<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.830> then<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.490> last<00:00:42.640> two<00:00:42.940> will<00:00:43.390> just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
things and then the last two will just

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.750 
things and then the last two will just
be<00:00:43.630> regular<00:00:43.810> outlets<00:00:44.320> with<00:00:44.500> switches<00:00:44.920> so<00:00:45.610> if<00:00:45.700> I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
be regular outlets with switches so if I

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.210 
be regular outlets with switches so if I
want<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.910> plug<00:00:46.060> something<00:00:46.300> into<00:00:46.510> there<00:00:46.750> like<00:00:47.220> a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
want to plug something into there like a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.569 
want to plug something into there like a
timer<00:00:49.470> in<00:00:50.470> order<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:50.830> all<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.130> I<00:00:51.340> had<00:00:51.550> to

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
timer in order to do all this I had to

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.090 
timer in order to do all this I had to
go<00:00:51.760> ahead<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.270> build<00:00:52.450> my<00:00:52.630> own<00:00:52.890> DC<00:00:53.890> power

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
go ahead and build my own DC power

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.750 
go ahead and build my own DC power
supply<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:55.000> 5<00:00:55.510> volt<00:00:55.720> an<00:00:55.900> 12<00:00:56.140> volt<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:57.220> what

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
supply for 5 volt an 12 volt and what

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.920 
supply for 5 volt an 12 volt and what
you<00:00:57.850> see<00:00:58.000> here<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.450> with<00:00:58.750> these<00:00:58.900> little

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
you see here is with these little

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.840 
you see here is with these little
transistors<00:00:59.680> the<00:01:00.010> transistors<00:01:00.550> are<00:01:00.700> what's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
transistors the transistors are what's

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.729 
transistors the transistors are what's
going<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.030> actually<00:01:01.090> trip<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.720> relays<00:01:02.050> from

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
going to actually trip the relays from

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.979 
going to actually trip the relays from
the<00:01:02.950> micro<00:01:03.250> controller<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:03.940> micro<00:01:04.269> micro

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
the micro controller to the micro micro

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.599 
the micro controller to the micro micro
controller<00:01:05.379> can't<00:01:05.649> handle<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.130> 12<00:01:06.399> volt

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
controller can't handle the 12 volt

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.550 
controller can't handle the 12 volt
under<00:01:07.359> milling<00:01:07.659> app<00:01:08.999> current<00:01:09.999> for<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.210> coil

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
under milling app current for the coil

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.010 
under milling app current for the coil
so<00:01:11.560> using<00:01:11.979> that<00:01:12.130> what<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.299> here<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.749> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
so using that what I have here is the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.239 
so using that what I have here is the
Ethernet<00:01:14.829> controller<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.700> Arduino<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.920> pH

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
Ethernet controller the Arduino my pH

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:21.029 
Ethernet controller the Arduino my pH
probe<00:01:18.549> it's<00:01:19.030> setting<00:01:19.389> in<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.859> storage<00:01:20.859> solution

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
probe it's setting in a storage solution

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.520 
probe it's setting in a storage solution
right<00:01:21.340> now<00:01:21.429> so<00:01:21.789> it's<00:01:21.999> around<00:01:22.119> for<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.810> pH<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.319> 4

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
right now so it's around for a pH of 4

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.849 
right now so it's around for a pH of 4
and<00:01:24.429> we<00:01:24.850> have<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.270> temperature<00:01:26.049> probe<00:01:26.380> which

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
and we have the temperature probe which

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.739 
and we have the temperature probe which
will<00:01:26.889> be<00:01:27.399> setting<00:01:27.850> down<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.210> water<00:01:28.389> measuring

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
will be setting down the water measuring

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:34.169 
will be setting down the water measuring
temperature<00:01:31.649> LCD<00:01:32.649> interface<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:33.639> that<00:01:34.030> you

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
temperature LCD interface so that you

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.080 
temperature LCD interface so that you
can<00:01:34.329> locally<00:01:34.929> control<00:01:35.229> everything<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:36.090> also

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
can locally control everything and also

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.239 
can locally control everything and also
the<00:01:37.659> web<00:01:38.109> interface<00:01:38.319> control<00:01:38.829> so<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.039> can<00:01:39.159> do

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
the web interface control so I can do

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.340 
the web interface control so I can do
something<00:01:39.579> remotely<00:01:39.999> you<00:01:40.749> see<00:01:40.959> right<00:01:41.109> now<00:01:41.200> it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
something remotely you see right now it

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.899 
something remotely you see right now it
says<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:42.479> pH<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.630> temperature<00:01:46.139> okay<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.920> with

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
says the pH and temperature okay so with

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.179 
says the pH and temperature okay so with
this<00:01:49.119> you<00:01:49.749> know<00:01:49.840> I'll<00:01:50.049> have<00:01:50.289> a<00:01:50.649> couple<00:01:51.009> buttons

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
this you know I'll have a couple buttons

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.800 
this you know I'll have a couple buttons
set<00:01:51.459> up<00:01:51.579> to<00:01:51.700> where<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:51.880> can<00:01:52.209> scroll<00:01:52.479> through<00:01:52.719> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
set up to where I can scroll through the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.459 
set up to where I can scroll through the
menus<00:01:53.139> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.569> this<00:01:55.719> is<00:01:55.869> like<00:01:56.020> this<00:01:56.259> could

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
menus of the so this is like this could

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.069 
menus of the so this is like this could
be<00:01:56.499> a<00:01:56.560> whatever<00:01:57.159> menu<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:57.579> want<00:01:57.880> for<00:01:58.840> different

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
be a whatever menu I want for different

left<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.899> right<00:02:07.959> and<00:02:08.320> off<00:02:08.530> time<00:02:08.830> what<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
left and right and off time what the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.720 
left and right and off time what the
left<00:02:10.810> pump<00:02:11.680> would<00:02:11.800> be<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.070> for<00:02:12.280> two<00:02:12.400> seconds

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
left pump would be on for two seconds

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
left pump would be on for two seconds
the<00:02:12.850> right<00:02:13.000> pump<00:02:13.210> would<00:02:13.360> be<00:02:13.480> on

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the right pump would be on

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.600 
the right pump would be on
two<00:02:13.960> seconds<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.440> then<00:02:14.560> they<00:02:15.190> would<00:02:15.310> both<00:02:15.550> be

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
two seconds and then they would both be

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.590 
two seconds and then they would both be
off<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.270> two<00:02:16.420> seconds<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.130> that'll<00:02:18.130> be

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
off for two seconds and that'll be

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.660 
off for two seconds and that'll be
adjustable<00:02:19.600> at<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.080> interface<00:02:20.470> itself<00:02:20.830> with

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
adjustable at the interface itself with

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.750 
adjustable at the interface itself with
a<00:02:21.700> potentiometer<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.950> see<00:02:24.160> it's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
a potentiometer you can see it's

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.530 
a potentiometer you can see it's
actually<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:26.050> my<00:02:26.590> mess<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.070> wires<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
actually in my mess of wires here the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.230 
actually in my mess of wires here the
yellow<00:02:29.230> LED<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> red<00:02:30.700> LED<00:02:30.850> are

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
yellow LED and the red LED are

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.160 
yellow LED and the red LED are
simulating<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.220> surge<00:02:33.220> pumps<00:02:33.670> right<00:02:33.820> now<00:02:34.170> so

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
simulating the surge pumps right now so

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.690 
simulating the surge pumps right now so
you'd<00:02:35.290> have<00:02:35.320> your<00:02:35.940> left<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.290> then<00:02:38.410> your<00:02:38.530> right

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
you'd have your left and then your right

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.800 
you'd have your left and then your right
and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:39.850> me<00:02:39.970> they're<00:02:40.330> both<00:02:40.450> off<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.810> doing

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and then me they're both off but doing

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.720 
and then me they're both off but doing
all<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.080> allows<00:02:45.010> me<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.310> kind<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.550> customize

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
all that allows me to kind of customize

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.600 
all that allows me to kind of customize

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
temperature well I want my temperature

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.060 
temperature well I want my temperature
to<00:03:09.370> stay<00:03:09.489> at<00:03:09.610> 77<00:03:10.239> then<00:03:10.330> if<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> falls<00:03:10.840> below

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
to stay at 77 then if it falls below

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.050 
to stay at 77 then if it falls below
let's<00:03:12.070> say<00:03:12.190> 76<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:14.290> LCD<00:03:14.680> will<00:03:14.830> turn<00:03:14.980> blue<00:03:15.220> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
let's say 76 the LCD will turn blue and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.990 
let's say 76 the LCD will turn blue and
if<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.630> rises<00:03:16.840> above<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.980> know<00:03:18.750> 78<00:03:19.750> 79<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:21.340> LCD

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
if it rises above you know 78 79 the LCD

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.220 
if it rises above you know 78 79 the LCD
will<00:03:22.180> turn<00:03:22.810> red<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.239> then<00:03:25.450> also<00:03:25.870> if

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
will turn red so that and then also if

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.320 
will turn red so that and then also if
the<00:03:26.350> pH<00:03:26.680> drops<00:03:26.950> or<00:03:27.340> any<00:03:27.700> other<00:03:27.850> thing<00:03:28.120> that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
the pH drops or any other thing that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.509 
the pH drops or any other thing that
needs<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.630> be<00:03:28.690> monitored<00:03:29.140> on<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.380> tank<00:03:29.620> goes

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
needs to be monitored on the tank goes

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.690 
needs to be monitored on the tank goes
array<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:32.230> LCD<00:03:32.590> will<00:03:32.799> turn<00:03:32.980> red<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.489> way

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
array the LCD will turn red so that way

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.210 
array the LCD will turn red so that way
I<00:03:33.730> get<00:03:33.910> an<00:03:34.090> alert<00:03:34.380> kind<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.440> locally<00:03:35.890> telling

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
I get an alert kind of locally telling

all of it just kind of needs to be

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.380 
all of it just kind of needs to be
finalized<00:03:41.489> code<00:03:42.489> needs<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:42.850> cleaned<00:03:43.150> up<00:03:43.269> a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
finalized code needs to be cleaned up a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.660 
finalized code needs to be cleaned up a
little<00:03:43.480> bit<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.989> take<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.890> all<00:03:44.980> apart<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.400> add
