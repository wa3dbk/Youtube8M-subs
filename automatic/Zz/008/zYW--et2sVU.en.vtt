to that it will actually load the
objects<00:02:34.880> into<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.630> thin<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.440> space<00:02:36.680> with

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
objects into the thin to the space with

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.300 
objects into the thin to the space with
you<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.880> was<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.290> 3gs<00:02:39.290> solar<00:02:39.530> system<00:02:39.950> which<00:02:40.160> is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you so I was a 3gs solar system which is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.050 
you so I was a 3gs solar system which is
now<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.390> space<00:02:41.630> with<00:02:41.900> us
