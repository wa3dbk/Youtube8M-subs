00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello dear friends how have you managed 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.900
 notice today in our unpacking 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.900
 titanfall 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 I drove with this box in the subway 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:36.150
 Can you imagine how stupid you looked? 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.440
 something like this is very similar to 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.309
 such a small washing machine 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.070
 I am the size of a cow 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.640
 In general, we start unpacking the first thing that I do 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.750
 I saw this certificate and I will tell you 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 and just there certificate by the way this 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.150
 certificate confirming that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.280
 all such toys 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.610
 such collection editions in the world in 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.200
 35000 all over the world and we 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 version here please pay attention 19 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.659
 thousand five hundred and thirty-third 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.330
 was released we possess spend like 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.920
 we are lucky you probably know all that 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.900
 such a titanfall is one of the most 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.479
 expected games of the year according to the magazine 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.210
 Navigator of the game world, let's continue 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.119
 watch what's in the box 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.390
 after we saw the certificate i 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.280
 I found 2 of these 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.110
 let's look at the soldiers 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.370
 because in fact they are impossible 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 put here have any 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.930
 fixtures to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.590
 set them up on something that's what 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:53.070
 let's watch too on titan huge 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.950
 the robot which you can in this game 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.050
 control this robot in fact 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.080
 he is plastic 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.760
 although they say that many toys 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.110
 collectible make from artificial 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.750
 stone but you know it seems to me here 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.170
 the choice 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.510
 plastic what to make a toy from plastic 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.850
 he is justified because if this 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.190
 the toy was made of artificial 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.970
 the stone that uplift was simply unreal 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.150
 and this version you know not just like that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.820
 drag if it's a stone then you can probably 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 next to this my lie down now 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.590
 it is clear why we need these soldiers and 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.910
 where are they inserted 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.470
 we can put together a real diorama here 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.130
 the battle despite the fact that the game is done 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.010
 on the engine 11 years ago on this 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.739
 half-life 2 engine still worked there 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.380
 the scenery does not collapse the game anyway 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.560
 looks beautiful and cool most important 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.959
 that a lot of things are allowed in it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.470
 despite the fact that the game has some 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.890
 plot 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.480
 you don't notice him because the most 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.420
 interesting in this game is that you 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.250
 can fly manage huge and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.760
 titans by the way, see what I found 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:18.630
 can change players very praise the balance 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.560
 In the game, by the way, see on the figure 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.120
 robot fighter it is not just there 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.100
 got this opportunity too there 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.680
 game on implemented how in 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.409
 first if it is for example 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.480
 opponent you can jump on titanium 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.110
 shoot it thereby blow up 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.970
 robot or if it is ally can 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.420
 ride it by the way was spotted 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.730
 glitch 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.690
 that you can ride this way not only 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.069
 on huge robots but also on ordinary 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.510
 soldiers about it looks like 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.810
 collectors often invest all sorts 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 figurines but for these usually somewhere quality 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.180
 not really somewhere you don't understand 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.280
 where does the cost come from here 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.490
 really with done very cool 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.360
 firstly good plastic good 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.050
 300 elements are painted that is all this 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.880
 diorama consists of 300 elements it 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.209
 admirable and worth the money 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.430
 what is asked for this collectible 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.690
 after playing with a figure 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.030
 she is i'm sure you have half a day you 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:34.830
 will be able to further study the contents 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:37.770
 boxes what is it with us is our scheme 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.370
 robot name is atlas or from class 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.320
 To be honest I do not know the scheme on which 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.910
 items are depicted and most importantly you 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.400
 can see how big this robot is 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.020
 here pay attention this is our infantryman 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.610
 Well, actually shy strongly much higher 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:02.570
 soldier art from the game thick by the way 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.570
 heavy book 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.440
 the game takes place in the future in 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.450
 this book is actually presented 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.810
 factions that are in the game are represented 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.160
 some units 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:24.150
 like this animal technique even somewhere i'm 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:28.229
 saw in general a pretty story 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.990
 standard apogee is of course a game 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.220
 you can play it for 16 years i'm sure that you 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.650
 already hit 16 small failures 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.920
 trapped the game at the very beginning 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.080
 first when 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.270
 just started selling sorry 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.880
 some players complained about not 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.220
 service available for a network shooter 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.780
 agree this is a big problem after 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.600
 after sales started on x-box one 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.520
 collapsed life service from microsoft 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.010
 it has nothing to do but agree 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.550
 when you buy a network shooter you 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.810
 should be able to play on 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.550
 server 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.250
 chop with other players because 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.280
 otherwise this whole game is just a piece 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.260
 plastic but we found a way out 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.900
 we really had no such problem 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.450
 the server was constantly available we could 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.180
 much chopped but if all the same 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.980
 learn so that the server will be cut off from us 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:30.300
 there is a huge figure and we can 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.300
 trite play martinet 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.310
 and something like that
