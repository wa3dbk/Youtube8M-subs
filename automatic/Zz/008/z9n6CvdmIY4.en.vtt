00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.160 
gonna get dark soon
and<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.620> video<00:02:01.820> someday

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and I want to make this video someday

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.410 
and I want to make this video someday
all<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.710> say<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.250> already<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.210> what

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
all I can say I already know what

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.840 
all I can say I already know what
Excalibur<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.140> capable<00:02:07.650> but<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.369> still<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
Excalibur is capable but I still have to

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.550 
Excalibur is capable but I still have to
test<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> never<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.170> there

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
test it you know you never know if there

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.750 
test it you know you never know if there
might<00:02:10.710> be<00:02:10.740> something<00:02:11.160> wrong<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> steel

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
might be something wrong with the steel

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.030 
might be something wrong with the steel
so<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> definitely<00:02:12.840> needs<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> be<00:02:13.290> tested<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
so it definitely needs to be tested and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.070 
so it definitely needs to be tested and
as<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.580> hurts<00:02:14.970> sometimes<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:15.780> it's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
as much it hurts sometimes because it's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.840 
as much it hurts sometimes because it's
already<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.830> already<00:02:16.980> finished<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.610> has

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
already it's already finished it has

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.010 
already it's already finished it has
nice<00:02:18.120> finish<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.840> nice<00:02:19.020> very<00:02:19.709> high<00:02:20.010> polish

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
nice finish on it nice very high polish

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.930 
nice finish on it nice very high polish
siding<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.220> have<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> can

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
siding but I just have to know I can

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.000 
siding but I just have to know I can
cannot<00:02:24.840> send<00:02:25.170> out<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> knife<00:02:25.740> like<00:02:25.950> this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
cannot send out a knife like this

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.949 
cannot send out a knife like this
because<00:02:26.610> I'm<00:02:26.730> expecting<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.600> using

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
because I'm expecting this to be using

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.110 
because I'm expecting this to be using
use<00:02:28.080> hard<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.740> cannot<00:02:29.340> risk<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.790> something

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
use hard I cannot risk that something

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.370 
use hard I cannot risk that something
might<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.540> wrong<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.930> heat<00:02:31.110> treat

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
might be wrong with the heat treat

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.090 
might be wrong with the heat treat
probably<00:02:32.100> very<00:02:32.550> very<00:02:33.020> not<00:02:34.020> likely<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.920> maybe

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
probably very very not likely but maybe

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.280 
probably very very not likely but maybe
some<00:02:35.720> microfracturing<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.870> seal<00:02:37.110> or

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
some microfracturing to seal or

some microfracturing to seal or
something<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.520> only<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> see<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.330> is

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
something and the only way to see it is

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.040 
something and the only way to see it is
to<00:02:39.720> test<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.680> I'll<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:42.120> easy

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
to test it so I'll do just some easy

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.449 
to test it so I'll do just some easy
ones<00:02:43.380> first<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.010> I'll<00:02:44.130> show<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.340> what

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
ones first and then I'll show you what

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.030 
ones first and then I'll show you what
it<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.700> actually<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.400> actually

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
it can actually do this is actually

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.500 
it can actually do this is actually
pretty<00:02:53.040> damn<00:02:53.310> nice<00:02:53.580> team<00:02:53.940> grind<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.199 

bouncing<00:03:00.510> off<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> button<00:03:03.060> that

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
bouncing off but you see the button that

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.740 
bouncing off but you see the button that
just<00:03:03.239> wrist<00:03:03.780> flicks<00:03:04.080> pretty<00:03:04.350> much<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:05.820> know<00:03:06.269> all

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
just wrist flicks pretty much I know all

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.600 
just wrist flicks pretty much I know all
is<00:03:06.959> pretty<00:03:07.440> skilled<00:03:07.769> with<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.070> knife<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.580> I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
is pretty skilled with the knife so I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.070 
is pretty skilled with the knife so I
don't<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.090> worry<00:03:09.360> about<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:11.400> being<00:03:12.090> used

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
don't have to worry about it being used

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.770 
don't have to worry about it being used
improperly<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:14.340> know<00:03:15.380> let<00:03:16.380> me<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:17.780> what

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
improperly you know let me see what

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
improperly you know let me see what
sucks<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.470> have<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> brace<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.250> it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
sucks is that I have to brace it so it

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.770 
sucks is that I have to brace it so it
has<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.549> contact<00:03:21.090> that's<00:03:21.209> why<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.420> couldn't<00:03:21.660> make

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
has a contact that's why I couldn't make

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
has a contact that's why I couldn't make
the<00:03:22.049> last<00:03:22.290> cut<00:03:22.440> yesterday<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:23.549> soon<00:03:23.730> as<00:03:23.850> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the last cut yesterday as soon as you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.610 
the last cut yesterday as soon as you
have<00:03:24.030> space<00:03:24.360> underneath<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.989> will<00:03:25.140> bounce<00:03:25.350> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
have space underneath it will bounce and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
have space underneath it will bounce and
it<00:03:25.739> will<00:03:25.860> absorb<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.400> lot<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.580> energy<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.269> I'll

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it will absorb a lot of energy so I'll

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.930 
it will absorb a lot of energy so I'll
go<00:03:27.870> back<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.220> back<00:03:29.400> grip<00:03:29.640> for<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
go back on the back grip for the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:44.270 
go back on the back grip for the
chopping<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.600> let's<00:03:31.530> let's<00:03:31.950> see

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.170 

that's<00:03:45.280> five<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.379> one<00:03:47.590> was<00:03:47.829> actually<00:03:48.180> not

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
that's five and the one was actually not

00:03:49.180 --> 00:04:05.280 
that's five and the one was actually not
well<00:03:49.510> placed<00:03:49.840> at<00:03:50.079> all<00:04:03.750> get<00:04:04.750> missing<00:04:05.109> them<00:04:05.260> a

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
well placed at all get missing them a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:20.610 
well placed at all get missing them a
little<00:04:05.590> bit<00:04:06.540> all<00:04:07.540> right<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:20.079> I've<00:04:20.169> been<00:04:20.320> trying

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
little bit all right so I've been trying

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.700 
little bit all right so I've been trying
with<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.039> edge<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.579> little<00:04:22.389> bit<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.050> certain

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
with the edge a little bit to a certain

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.830 
with the edge a little bit to a certain
degree<00:04:23.830> you<00:04:24.100> can<00:04:24.280> pry<00:04:24.490> with<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.820> tool<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.510> it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
degree you can pry with this tool and it

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.490 
degree you can pry with this tool and it
is<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:26.020> very<00:04:26.470> very<00:04:26.830> fine<00:04:27.250> edge<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.750> show<00:04:29.320> it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
is a very very fine edge just to show it

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.969 
is a very very fine edge just to show it
look<00:04:29.710> at<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:31.139> that<00:04:32.139> is<00:04:32.199> I<00:04:32.560> didn't<00:04:32.830> measure

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
look at that that is I didn't measure

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.500 
look at that that is I didn't measure
this<00:04:33.220> one<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.729> actually<00:04:33.910> feels<00:04:34.270> even

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
this one but it actually feels even

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.930 
this one but it actually feels even
thinner<00:04:34.900> than<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.350> Bigfoot<00:04:36.100> yesterday<00:04:36.520> just

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
thinner than the Bigfoot yesterday just

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.279 
thinner than the Bigfoot yesterday just
because<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.330> blade<00:04:37.539> is<00:04:37.570> actually<00:04:37.810> slightly

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
because the blade is actually slightly

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.300 
because the blade is actually slightly
higher<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:41.080> really<00:04:41.620> really<00:04:41.919> thin<00:04:41.949> edge

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
higher and it's really really thin edge
