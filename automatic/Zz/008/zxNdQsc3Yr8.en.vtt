00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:16.560
 the idea did not come by itself I have long been 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.410
 Watching Kay Pop 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.410
 you have fun here 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.390
 the beginning of this year I went to the force 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.839
 rut and there he personally found his partner 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 jameson or chemistry content company here 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:41.250
 we signed a contract here and decided 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.519
 do exactly Kiev content 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 accordingly on this wave and we 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.400
 have made a project a television project 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 Key Top idols on the Korean system 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.960
 systems 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.080
 Well, you know, I think that you are personally mine 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.839
 the opinion is Korean Asian 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.439
 culture is very much like us on 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.380
 Kazakhs here we are also calm people on 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.360
 in fact, we respect no elders 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 such a scandal is not really loved 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.060
 this is all there europe america so i 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.479
 Something was looking for a mismatch 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.999
 naturally in Korea and found therefore she 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 close to my soul was precisely why a 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:28.369
 korea korean system plus well and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.399
 result and talk now she is already 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.469
 subculture is already a whole subculture 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.829
 so tell me how many people 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.289
 originally applied for a song somewhere 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.359
 but thousands have not been very any 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.700
 there were thousands of applications here 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:49.829
 of them we chose 24 first 24 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.719
 man until the end had to go 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.850
 but I decided to remove a few guys here 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:01.670
 now 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.850
 they are 19 students and now they are like 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.410
 19 somewhere 50 percent I so hope that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.770
 will remain in the project line will be mine 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.380
 trainees of eagle brothers companies 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.750
 the goal is precisely to get hold of 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.030
 good artists 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.300
 But you know that this is not 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 only talent but performance up 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.800
 human factors 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.050
 that is very important therefore it is necessary to me 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.810
 I had to remove a few guys and among 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.819
 they have already appeared translate who can 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.340
 compose myself i mean they have something of their own 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.550
 try to do everything there are of course 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.840
 have them namely chosen 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.330
 let's say the name of these guys who can already 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.350
 until the world poem itself to compose 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.230
 up accordingly I already think that 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.299
 principle will give now possible of them 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.950
 some team to collect or so they 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:06.769
 how would you start to drink your own 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.930
 author's song here but this little I want 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.769
 so they first of all like very 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.319
 personalities 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.609
 first up to 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.659
 well settled down roughly you know 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.780
 what is star fever you know what 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.989
 young guys are over 18 19 years old they 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.629
 don't understand many things and start 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:35.389
 why to jump here and it's bad here 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:38.689
 same is exactly in korean with those 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:42.349
 there from 1 to 2 years 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:45.019
 only tough discipline brings up 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.950
 guys so here I think it is very 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.290
 right well why is it scoring because 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.389
 there moment group horde is the most 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.810
 old groups what is the current 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:04:00.069
 time we already mean 15 in style 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.359
 ayrenbi mean if '90 doctors 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.900
 why i'm talking about human factors 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.980
 because the group is not a dream and hundreds 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.769
 man it can only 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.409
 envy of myself and then the clock is human 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.909
 factors before the relationship of relationships 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.560
 precisely because of this falls in the main time 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.509
 break up groups and accordingly 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.479
 I have a natural future producer 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.909
 understanding knowing i'm a debtor to educate and to 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:30.169
 they are correct as a parade our result and 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:32.389
 understand bastard yes yes say in 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.090
 further he what here guys who 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.009
 will pass all three stages it will be next 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.030
 full-fledged such a star factory 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:43.039
 shooting a coat clip on well accordingly 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.080
 exactly what she rudely Lord 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.979
 makes his whole career 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.750
 so in the same way and will be done 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.120
 under this path and it is we who will 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.690
 well, maybe a little bit different 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.750
 why because now with anyway 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.510
 little music style and genre changing 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.790
 already aram beyu how do you say hip hop 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.060
 a little bit back already kay-pop 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:14.640
 it becomes already up to 7 leading as 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.450
 style that's a plus that they have a great 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.670
 plus it 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.310
 korean experts that we do not 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.460
