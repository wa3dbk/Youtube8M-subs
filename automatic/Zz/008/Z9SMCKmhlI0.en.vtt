00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.730
 the test of the world is gabriel who 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.169
 as you prefer and today we are 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.130
 so find for the presentation of a 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.179
 mode on minecraft so the pacs tray mode 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.710
 so the first important kraft to 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.679
 know for this mode actually it's going to be 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.300
 the baroud wants so in fact it's going to be 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:35.120
 two leather with two of the thong so of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.310
 string like this and it gave me the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.270
 bread beyond rubber with seconds to 2 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.000
 what can we do we will 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.220
 just do not cook so we 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.100
 will take a small charger and we will 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.470
 cook and it does not work because 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.590
 I put some simple leather 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.110
 I'm super smart here we go 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.400
 see what it does so here we are 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.870
 does the network stand 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.640
 so now we can think we can 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.280
 move on to interesting things so 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 when you make a leather chest between 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.989
 quotes it will make us a backpack 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.240
 all stupid 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.550
 then if we put in colorant in the center 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 to make us a full bag of this 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.160
 color then if we take a bag 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.150
 that we have already crafted and that we 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.950
 surround it with de tadla come from 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.740
 those of her of this kraft cuy me it's going 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.560
 So give us impeccable or backpack 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.800
 so in fact that's going to hold 27 items and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.200
 we have to do it once 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.360
 improve it it will now hold 57th ' 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.350
 head 54 forgiveness so double that's it 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.990
 can also just kraft is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.520
 directly a big bag pack so with a 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.170
 chest with thyme directly one can 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 also directly colored a bag to 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.100
 back already kraft is just placing the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.540
 dye side of the bag and it goes the colorful 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.070
 then the bag pack interface gets 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.780
 present like those here so we click 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 right under just to open it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.600
 and then we can put our stuff 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 in 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.410
 here and if we open it we can 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.910
 recover at any time 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.550
 same for the big bag pack what it is 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.959
 a lot bigger the last backpack 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.849
 that we can craft with this mode so that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.970
 is going to be the n 2 backpack so for the 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.920
 do we're going to surround one and chest of the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.500
 standby that will give us the m2 backpack 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.370
 so the n 2 does not beat that in fact the sum 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.010
 there the difference with others is 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.430
 that he will share the line with their 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.230
 coffers 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.900
 So here we see we have 60 of coal 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.269
 if I open this one has 60 coal 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.430
 if I take off their half 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.140
 again there is only half 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.610
 so it's great for systems 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.110
 we do not want to lose we put them 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.970
 all in there after if we ever die 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.130
 just recruit this backpack for 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.660
 get them one last little thing 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.090
 which is pretty cool to know too that's 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.319
 that if we put ourselves in the figure so 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.299
 in mad that actually right click 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.440
 we can rename our bag so by 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.090
 example is undermined ore hop there and that's it 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.319
 we have our mineral bag and then we 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.510
 can put for example how does one do 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:15.640
 choices g13 that's it and we put dolphin 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.070
 that's how we drank smoked etc. 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.510
 my you can name new bac bac here 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.489
 so that's all for the presentation of 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.650
 this simple sweet little fashion but that is 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.780
 all the same super interesting because 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.100
 that it adds something super 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.600
 useful I think we sell would like me 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.579
 know everything backpacks to be able to 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.910
 for example that we will mine recovered 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.799
 full of goblins place of duty 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.880
 go back home with them for 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.690
 drop all our cowboy at each 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.370
 two seconds 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.799
 so I think it's very very 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 useful and that's why I wanted 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.430
 present you this mode so thank you 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.500
 to have watched and we find ourselves 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.200
 the preferred approach and today we are 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.820
 find in front of andy age pnj so 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.079
 on minecraft for a new 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.090
 fashion presentation lacks actually 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.890
 today the mode it's going to be beat the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.810
 werder dieuze is actually what this mode 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.060
 does that go just changed to 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.630
 the artificial intelligence of the NPCs and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.630
 also the rat
