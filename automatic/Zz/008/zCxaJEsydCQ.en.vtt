00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.630
 the eyes are reduced to going to be the part 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.790
 south but well below they are also 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.160
 Loaded green and yellow circles between 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.420
 the double eyeliner alignment outside 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.820
 I hope you like this tutorial 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.160
 I send you a kiss this look that is 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 inspired by a friend that I love 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.949
 her looks she made this drawing in a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 chart and she is the badri 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.769
 valeri dexter I'm going to put the photo of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.409
 she is a lovely make-up I 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.979
 I tried to recreate I hope you like my 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.009
 invention I send a little kiss and take care 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.009
 much 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.640
 we will apply as always to the test 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.370
 it shades does not loosen with mother and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.140
 apply the pre shadow and then we go 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.470
 to take a black crayon I'm 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.600
 using a bird of l'ore to do 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.000
 draw rather an almond in the eye 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.250
 of black color this almond we are going to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.410
 spread up very slightly 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.810
 I'm using one of the brushes that 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.990
 rifar are going to go for it 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.330
 knowing and then that blur what 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.190
 I'm going to seal with a shade of color 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.600
 rosita any shade I have I'm 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.640
 using that a pretty shadow 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.140
 vibrant your any shadow recipe that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920
 have even a blush is going to 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.990
 to serve 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.720
 you have to blur it perfectly in the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.450
 upper eyelid as our color of 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.210
 transition and that is integrated into our 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.630
 color of the eyebrow bone then I'm going 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.100
 to take this shadow in blue 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.950
 pretty vibrant that comes in a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.860
 pallet can also use pigments 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.390
 of blue color or some shade that they have 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.070
 not so vibrant maybe what 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.630
 they were a little more discreet and this color 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.880
 we are going to apply it in the center of 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.220
 We are going to compact the mobile eyelid 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.850
 color perfectly and it will take a 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.040
 vibration 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.200
 before good because we have the color 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.380
 black then I'm going to take a zone of 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.240
 Matte bone color to illuminate the bone 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.730
 of the eyebrow and lower the intensity of the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.800
 pink if we move here towards 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.460
 up is a good opportunity to 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.460
 color down to the height or 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.170
 intensity that we want in the play already 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.750
 these I will take a shade of color 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.020
 black this shadow is the darkest that 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.210
 I have all of them and that is the reason and the 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.310
 I'm using to do the delineation 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.590
 a is not a hundred delineated but is for 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.740
 mark our delineation guideline 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.290
 outward and where will I close the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.960
 mobile eyelid how far I am going to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.600
 Fill those spaces in black 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.340
 so that it collides with the blue color and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.340
 then I will follow it for the part of the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.130
 high crease to define the eyelid 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.200
 mobile above this color also what 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.750
 let's smudge with a loose brush 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.030
 that is not so big and we 're going to 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 integrate the pink color that we already apply 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.380
 on top 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.160
 then I'm going to take a gel liner 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.800
 with a tiny brush this is from the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.820
 luxury brand that is the smallest that 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.290
 I have believe that it is serving me 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.090
 enough and I'm going to put it to mark already 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.190
 the guide line I had with the shadow 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.560
 black is easier that way and I'm going to go back 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.930
 the stroke to thicken enough 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.170
 after applying two looks tabs 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.480
 the first one will be the ix and looks of 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.920
 house or classes and the second one is going to be 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.000
 also of house or terms but the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.560
 iconic 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.300
 can use if they want nothing more than a 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.170
 neighborhood I wanted to do it because in the 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.660
 valeri pixel art drawing has the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.090
 luxury tabs pretty marked and 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.800
 quite long fairies later I will take 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.720
 a yellow zone that I did a relax 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.640
 this the shadow in which it moistens in 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.740
 the wet application issue relax 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.010
 a lot a batidero but good you 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.950
 apply the dry one so that they are not 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.380
 come out a batidillo and it works better in 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.359
 dry are recommended after I go to 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.640
 delineate the water line with an east 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.900
 the start crayon that is against water 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.090
 They must be used on Eto'o 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.790
 and they will also outline below 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.090
 the lower lashes and we're going to 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.759
 blur this color below with a 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.699
 a ballpoint or pointed brush or 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.949
 pencil as they want to take it and with the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.630
 same product the eyeliner but with a 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.990
 brush let's take the product to 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.030
 make the wing the second to the final and 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.250
 to fill the space in the lacrimal 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.509
 I'm also using it to create 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.330
 an angle a curved line to the in the 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.729
 animal to increase the size and 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.280
 that is connecting with the fold 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.380
 this crayon that is against a lie 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.720
 quite because it fades very well 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.820
 up and does not move for any 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.650
 next I'm going to take a zone of 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.960
 green color any green shadow that 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.360
 have I took first is colored 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.789
 but I feel like it did not work 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.490
 a lot so I took the darkest and most 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.349
 intense in matt color both for 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.860
 spread the bottom of the 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.870
 tabs 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.930
 and then apply then mask 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.479
 tabs up and down in several layers 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.780
 so they would not get lost in the 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.520
 makeup so intense and well this is the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.699
 final result for the eyes as 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.490
 can see is a pretty dramatic look 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.560
 it's a look more than anything else 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.430
 artistic more like for a catwalk 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.379
 for something like that but you know like always 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.879
 my future injury incremental any 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.159
 part of the video that serves him because it goes to 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.960
 be very great later for the 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:59.810
 vigils I'm using a rumor of 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.500
 pink color that is in color me 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.719
 fascinated and on the lips the drawing the 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.159
 it has very neutral which I am very 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.779
 agreement goes very much and I'm 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:12.009
 using a color for the bags 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:14.569
 this is the end I hope you like it 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.520
 it was very dramatic as you can see 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.620
 but you already know what 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.900
