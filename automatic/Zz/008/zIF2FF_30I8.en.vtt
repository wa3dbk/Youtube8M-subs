00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.049
 new tutorial to a new fraps 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.630
 Form tutorial and today I dedicate 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.750
 me alone the theme of the sound 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.490
 Recording with the microphone so your 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 Do you agree with one example 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.310
 Let's play with if you want 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.230
 want to do the whole thing in rape you have to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.789
 going in the rider movies is with me 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.010
 already activated up here and then 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.529
 you can find sound capture settings here 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.539
 record windows 7 2 and you take that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.930
 the gaming sound and also the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.340
 windows 7 2 and is called for example if 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 she has a hook here, he takes everything 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 on what as sound from yours 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120
 Speakers will come automatically 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.309
 then in the audio in the car track 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.570
 saved when you play a game 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.340
 and windows brings an error message 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.370
 and makes a noise this is 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.480
 noise with recorded so much once 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.039
 then we found right underneath here 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.109
 record external input here is now 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.840
 I have no microphone activated installed 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.650
 or inf raps set that has now 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.369
 to do with it because I'm eating 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.229
 I started before I got my microphone 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.689
 you had to plug in yours 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.810
 Microphone into the correct microphone socket 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.570
 get stuck before your fraps start 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.369
 otherwise you have no microphone here 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.380
 It's very important in this case and then yes 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.119
 synonymous only the microphone displayed what 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 actually under windows in the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.310
 Control Panel defined as standard 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.650
 is how the whole looks like I show 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.689
 so now you open the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.670
 Control Panel Settings 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.560
 computers are still up here 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 always control panel and then needs 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.119
 her the little submenu sound there 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 you click it once and then it opens 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 even this little submenus 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 sound is created here we have reproduction 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.420
 recording songs communication 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.719
 Of course we have to be honest 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.259
 Recording here we find now with me 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.299
 two microphones once a microphone 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.250
 that's how you feel about it 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.880
 small picture can quickly recognize 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.680
 the microphone of an integrated webcam 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.530
 I have the default with mir.de 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 because I do not use this microphone 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.060
 do not need and do not use 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.820
 want that into any here 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.209
 secret interception mission you know that 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.980
 by whom this microphone is activated 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.970
 and who can hear me or anything else 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.100
 no, I just always have it 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.110
 disabled because I just do not 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.540
 need and for this reason a few 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.180
 saving resources can also be good 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.160
 Here you see microphone line in the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.580
 is the microphone what i put in the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.650
 Microphones slash line in socket 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.810
 I put my sound card 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.300
 a signature high definition audio 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.760
 kadewe can see here and this 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.790
 Microphone is standard as the device 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.850
 defines the microphone that you use 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.190
 wanted to be here as a standard device 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.230
 it is not that it could be that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.940
 down here with as standard that is at 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.970
 me of course now disabled because I 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.750
 only an active microphone if you have 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.220
 then your microphone as 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.019
 defined default device you click 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.100
 down here on ok you can 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.760
 close the system control again and 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.760
 start flaps zero 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.130
 if you then , of course, starts recognizing 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.480
 her here again a hook record 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.580
 external input microphone line in see 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.130
 mattel high definition audio that is 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.310
 just what's under the sound 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.170
 settings of windows 7 was seen 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.690
 so yes now my microphone picked 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.530
 raps and I can handle it 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.360
 take up 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.510
 that was all I have now 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.910
 in the settings for the microphone 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.100
 if you can do the microphone yourself 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.320
 wanted to adjust a bit so 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.269
 you want to refine then you have to 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.720
 start the system control 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.000
 He goes back to the main menu 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.320
 Recording click here for example 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.090
 microphones new standard microphone 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.370
 that she wanted to hire and works 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.320
 characteristics like kidney up 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.329
 properties have gone and page in 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.820
 the characteristics for microphone or 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.849
 line-in here you have the opportunity 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.690
 general listening levels go extended 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.260
 we by algae 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.850
 my husband is a lot we hire 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.150
 Here we want to change the symbol 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.770
 do not listen bit principle too 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.600
 something we do not need where we are 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.060
 can not adjust and not 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.700
 absolutely must be level of the level 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.910
 however, is super important and indeed 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.250
 can you now the microphone here 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.400
 enter volume 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.070
 100 are 100% if that's less 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.470
 makes you reduce the volume of 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.880
 spoken voice so the volume 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.570
 from what you tell and say when 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.600
 now, for example, goes down to 90 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.690
 will only be 90 in the foreign lane 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.760
 percent of the volume of eur from yours 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.630
 agree with your recorded sound 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.730
 recorded 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.400
 that is the games volume is 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.470
 of course still at 100 percent because of that 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.720
 I recommend that if you have a good one 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.830
 microphone has to let 100 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.990
 because if you put that down to 90 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.550
 Of course, it also reduces him 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.590
 side noises such as a 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.240
 own noise of the microphone I came 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.460
 as on 100 let me be right 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.570
 good sennheiser microphone then use 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.240
 we still have in the microphone below 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.730
 reinforcements ever we have looks like this 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.650
 as if we could adjust this 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.650
 we will give but we have 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.770
 here only the possibility 00 10 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.200
 and also 20 decibels to the microphone 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.930
 strengthen 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.430
 Again, it depends again 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.790
 what quality of the microphone do you have 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.950
 if you really have a good microphone 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.630
 Ten decibels is standard with me 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.180
 I'll let them try this 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.680
 attitude in your own mind too 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.830
 Of course this is from the microphone too 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.100
 Microphone always different and that's why 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.810
 my default settings are trying 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.750
 It only works with me 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.510
 wonderful and otherwise we have 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.970
 not every rider is extended again 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.380
 nothing we necessarily do now 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.800
 we have to stop everything like that 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.169
 ok and here again ok ok now 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.599
 we have set up the microphone 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:38.129
 set and now we can do ours 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.139
 capturing our pictures with fraps 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:43.830
 This was my little tutorial 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.270
 to the thing microphone in fraps me 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.729
 I hope one or the other 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.039
 a little help with the microphone 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.900
 you still had problems with friends 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.330
 more problems you can mine 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.550
 others you can mine too 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.180
 I have another fraps tutorials view 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.009
 a small fraps playlist created where 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.020
 I just do every tutorial I do 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.449
 about fraps do upload 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.770
 and yes, if you have questions yourself 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.050
 have problems write me that he the 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.250
 Comments 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.860
 if I know and what problem is 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.449
 Of course, I'll get involved 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.639
 tutorial a little help video 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.259
 because I think the problem that 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.449
 one of them will also be somewhere 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:23.069
 somehow somewhere sometime 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:25.680
 have others and therefore because of this 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.849
 videos always very very helpful as well 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.699
 said that 's it from me me 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:32.009
 say goodbye that was or that is 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.330
 I subscribed to the alv of alf tutorials

 bye bye and goodbye
