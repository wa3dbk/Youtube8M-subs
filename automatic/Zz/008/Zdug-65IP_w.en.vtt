 very good of all kids how is it 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.920
 I'm there mix of gamers and I bring a 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.020
 small tutorial since a subscriber me 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.790
 he asked and to not make it ugly 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.860
 I bring you how to create a bukit server 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.680
 this time I'm going to bring the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.539
 most current booking server there is 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.859
 less in the description you will have a pack 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.869
 of plugins the most essential if you want 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.330
 know how to use them although I suppose 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.580
 Some of you already know how 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.710
 do it alone you have to say less I 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.000
 I teach you how to use them well first thing 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.739
 we have here as you can see is a 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.699
 graus alberto folder and here you have 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.400
 a file and basically everything is everything 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.739
 that's the server missing create something else 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.619
 in my case we will no longer have the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.760
 winrar file to leave on mediafire 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.280
 is a file that is going to be called in what 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.000
 number I can put codes 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.950
 this is very important 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.070
 they are codes basically at hours in 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.820
 signals so they are now let's create 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 another new one we are going to create a new 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.350
 text file let's put the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.659
 server 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.540
 double click here going to get the 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.090
 codes in these codes are basically 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.330
 as you can see here put 32 bits java 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.899
 6 64 bits java 6 32 bits java 7 64 bits 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.729
 java 7 what does it mean if you have a 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.030
 32-bit operating system and you have 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.180
 java 6 would have to enter this code if 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.390
 you have 32 bits and havas 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 web up to 64 bits and java 6 then you put him 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.130
 to see to know how many bits you have 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 you have to go to home here team click 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.140
 right properties 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.570
 and here you will come out 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.330
 and in my case no type of system was 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.850
 operating 64 bits and how I have 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.619
 windows 7 touch put this here 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.229
 this code here in my case 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.259
 obviously this if you and you 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.240
 you have 32 bits and java 6 then you put him 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.190
 this is worth it and it depends on what you have 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.180
 that you in my case I will choose 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.599
 this we are going to copy 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.359
 perfect we put it here click now this 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.730
 from here the most important thing we delete until 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:27.359
 where you put erasure or where you put faces 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.090
 bukit and we're going to put the go to 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.090
 copy the name this one 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.129
 let's copy we paste it here 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 just pass them because if not the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.989
 it's going to be worth 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.350
 and it's basically the same already 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.450
 are we going save 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.520
 let's save how and keep that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.690
 file as dot bat 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:55.300
 and we put all the files save 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.300
 close and we can open it 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.660
 As you can see, we are creating the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.180
 unlock server here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.670
 you can see we already have Serbian created 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.670
 moment without clear plugins and if you want 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.590
 have an own ip to be able to open it 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.020
 to the public you have to download the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.810
 hamchi 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.520
 when you have machi in my case we go 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.660
 to open it to teach you a little 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.100
 you never have it in the description 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.070
 the hamas is a program to have 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.140
 servers is worth seeing for example me this 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.570
 it's hamas and it's worth this up here is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.190
 the ip generated by the program 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.380
 when you have hamas and could only 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.100
 have this little button and choose our 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.640
 name you are already clicking on the ip and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.250
 by copying ipv4 address to ipv6 is not worth 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.290
 for nothing copies the ip v4 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.200
 and you have to put it to see how it 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.620
 generates the world let's stop it for the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.620
 perfect 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.060
 please 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.370
 thanks for motte to be able to put 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.650
 our ip and configure all the server 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.270
 we have to go here server properties 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.490
 the folder stay generates it 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.080
 good the file or rather here the 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.340
 level and the name of our world 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.340
 we put we put tutorial 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.520
 and this does not require is the seed of 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.560
 map to know where you want to appear 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.290
 here you have to put our ip in my 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.080
 case would be this if you want is to piss 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.840
 of fish you are going to true if you do not put it 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.030
 false is it worth not 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.980
 the white list is for that between those 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.020
 players that you want to put I leave 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.020
 the false to bake animals 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.099
 texture that's why I have no idea this is 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.199
 very important now this the most 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.150
 important of the entire online tutorial 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.979
 mod this is in case you want that only 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.930
 between premium players if only if 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.440
 you want everybody to go with this 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.720
 well two ways 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.080
 you will have a file winrar the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.270
 configuration also applies and 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.790
 players that you want them to be in my 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.920
 case I'm going to put 50 this already depends 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.240
 of your internet connection supposes 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.490
 a lot if you have an internet connection 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.980
 pretty bad for putting less players 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.260
 because you are balaguer spanair monsters 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.170
 and that just put emphasis on everything 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.300
 when I want to record and basically already 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.500
 it's all we 're going file save and we're 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.320
 will generate everything we have 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.729
 programmed our server we are going to 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.879
 open it 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.020
 to check that everything is fine we are going 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.020
 to open our minecraft 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.040
 OK 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.610
 let's go here we go to our server 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.349
 we put our ip 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.210
 and being here we hope it's now 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.840
 because it has not yet been generated 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.840
 we go 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.659
 OK 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.250
 my mother how long it took to load that 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:06.070
 normal has to carry around the world and 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.750
 everything and legendary takes a little 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.110
 but good 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.810
 already when it is created to take less 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:19.040
 we are going to update and you open us 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.390
 they put on our 50 people and already 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.520
 it's basically already 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:28.620
 in this wade- laden world come deluxe 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.330
 perfect of our meadow world for 50 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.330
 people 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.180
 to the last I'll teach is how 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:40.139
 put the plugins 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:44.040
 and I obviously plugins that I already have in 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:47.130
 another server for example the plugins 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.120
 yes some plugin that I will leave in 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:54.600
 a pack of windows 2 plugins get into 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.910
 basically in your server folder and 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.920
 put them in the plugins folder here 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.900
 they put all with their folder and their 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.980
 archive 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.630
 basically good this has been all the 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.060
 tutorial I hope it has helped you if 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.670
 you want another tutorial on how to use the 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.650
 plugins you only have to give like and 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.560
 You can say a comment if you want it 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.050
 that has been a greeting, I hope that you 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.180
 has helped a lot and if that 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.180
 server come up later
