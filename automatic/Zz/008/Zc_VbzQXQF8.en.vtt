00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
those those are olive green so it is a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
very relatively good color if you are

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.590 
very relatively good color if you are
hiking<00:01:12.780> let's<00:01:13.680> say<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.159> forest<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
hiking let's say you know forest or in a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.999 
hiking let's say you know forest or in a
mountainside<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> military<00:01:19.350> product

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
mountainside this is a military product

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
mountainside this is a military product
so<00:01:20.330> basically<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:22.430> IR<00:01:23.430> protected<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so basically this is IR protected and I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
so basically this is IR protected and I
have<00:01:25.049> tested<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.979> works<00:01:26.549> quite<00:01:27.540> nicely

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have tested it so it works quite nicely

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.499 
have tested it so it works quite nicely
and<00:01:29.509> it's<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.500> discreet<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and it's also really discreet and so it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.679 
and it's also really discreet and so it
is<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:34.049> good<00:01:34.259> choice<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
is really good choice if you want to

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.240 
is really good choice if you want to
basically<00:01:36.689> keep<00:01:37.110> nosy<00:01:37.409> people<00:01:37.680> away<00:01:38.189> from

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
basically keep nosy people away from

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.359 
basically keep nosy people away from
your<00:01:38.610> camp<00:01:38.960> because<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.770> hard<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
your camp because this is really hard to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.690 
your camp because this is really hard to
spot<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.270> forest<00:01:42.689> let's<00:01:42.899> say<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.530> are

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
spot from a forest let's say if you are

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.969 
spot from a forest let's say if you are
making<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.909> camp<00:01:45.210> let's<00:01:46.079> say<00:01:46.200> 10<00:01:46.409> meters<00:01:46.799> away

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
making a camp let's say 10 meters away

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
making a camp let's say 10 meters away
from<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> road<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.000> there's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> couple<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
from a road and there's a couple of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.550 
from a road and there's a couple of
trees<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.299> difficult<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
trees so it's really difficult to the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.319 
trees so it's really difficult to the
free<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.640> from<00:01:53.909> let's<00:01:54.180> say<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
free and say this from let's say a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.280 
free and say this from let's say a
fallen<00:01:54.780> tree<00:01:55.070> from<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> distance<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
fallen tree from a distance so that is

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370 
fallen tree from a distance so that is
one<00:01:58.530> reason<00:01:58.560> why<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.310> might<00:01:59.759> want<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.659> get

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
one reason why you might want to get

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
one reason why you might want to get
this<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.729> hard<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> spot<00:02:03.299> there's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this because it's hard to spot there's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.139 
this because it's hard to spot there's
also<00:02:04.320> two<00:02:04.710> other<00:02:04.920> reasons<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.000> is

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
also two other reasons that this is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.619 
also two other reasons that this is
relatively<00:02:06.600> light<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:08.759> weighs<00:02:09.000> one

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
relatively light and this weighs one

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.850 
relatively light and this weighs one
thousand<00:02:10.020> three<00:02:10.170> hundred<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.530> fifty<00:02:10.830> grams

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
thousand three hundred and fifty grams

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.890 
thousand three hundred and fifty grams
and<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:12.390> also<00:02:12.660> backs

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and this also backs

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.970 
and this also backs
I'm<00:02:13.930> acting<00:02:14.200> two<00:02:14.439> relatively<00:02:14.890> small<00:02:15.280> space<00:02:15.459> so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
I'm acting two relatively small space so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.890 
I'm acting two relatively small space so
you<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.280> like<00:02:18.519> two<00:02:18.790> flies<00:02:19.090> or<00:02:19.390> three<00:02:19.599> flies

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
you get like two flies or three flies

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.000 
you get like two flies or three flies
with<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.709> stone<00:02:21.010> or<00:02:21.310> with<00:02:22.090> us<00:02:22.269> what<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:23.010> don't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
with one stone or with us what I don't

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.490 
with one stone or with us what I don't
know<00:02:24.069> how<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.280> kill<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:24.670> lies<00:02:24.849> but<00:02:25.420> anyhow<00:02:25.810> if

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
know how you kill of lies but anyhow if

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.089 
know how you kill of lies but anyhow if
you<00:02:26.680> compare<00:02:27.159> now<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.430> weight<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.659> this<00:02:29.099> let's

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
you compare now the weight of this let's

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.220 
you compare now the weight of this let's
say<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> heal<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.609> break<00:02:30.879> octo<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.200> a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
say to heal a break octo that is a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.270 
say to heal a break octo that is a
one-person<00:02:33.480> hiking<00:02:34.480> tent<00:02:34.750> those<00:02:35.650> will<00:02:35.980> weigh

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
one-person hiking tent those will weigh

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.690 
one-person hiking tent those will weigh
about<00:02:37.290> 1750<00:02:38.290> grams<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:42.010> means<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
about 1750 grams and this means that

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.390 
about 1750 grams and this means that
this<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:44.040> approximately<00:02:45.269> 400<00:02:46.269> grams<00:02:46.959> slider

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
this is approximately 400 grams slider

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.879 
this is approximately 400 grams slider
welded<00:02:48.959> 1350<00:02:49.959> grams<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.440> without<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
welded 1350 grams is without the

welded 1350 grams is without the
compression<00:02:51.430> pack<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:51.909> with<00:02:52.629> compression

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
compression pack so with compression

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.670 
compression pack so with compression
package<00:02:55.620> 1,450<00:02:56.620> grams<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.780> well<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:58.989> still

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
package 1,450 grams and well it's still

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.190 
package 1,450 grams and well it's still
it's<00:02:59.889> like<00:03:00.099> 300<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:00.819> 400<00:03:01.359> grams<00:03:01.629> lighter<00:03:01.870> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it's like 300 or 400 grams lighter and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.309 
it's like 300 or 400 grams lighter and
the<00:03:03.189> back<00:03:03.459> size<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.420> packing<00:03:04.780> size<00:03:05.019> is

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
the back size the packing size is

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.220 
the back size the packing size is
approximately<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:06.730> would<00:03:07.329> say<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.659> heart<00:03:07.959> of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
approximately I would say is heart of

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.839 
approximately I would say is heart of
the<00:03:08.439> octo<00:03:09.120> because<00:03:10.150> octo<00:03:10.659> has<00:03:10.810> relatively

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
the octo because octo has relatively

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.379 
the octo because octo has relatively
long<00:03:12.849> poles<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> really<00:03:15.760> had<00:03:15.939> to<00:03:15.970> compress

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
long poles that I really had to compress

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.920 
long poles that I really had to compress
because<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> aluminum<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:18.449> what<00:03:19.449> is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
because the aluminum so what is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.020 
because the aluminum so what is
separating<00:03:20.620> this<00:03:20.799> from<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.069> normal<00:03:21.519> pivot<00:03:21.879> back

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
separating this from a normal pivot back

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.229 
separating this from a normal pivot back
is<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:23.230> habit<00:03:23.739> has<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.069> hoop<00:03:24.340> or<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.699> tent

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
is that this habit has a hoop or a tent

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.869 
is that this habit has a hoop or a tent
pole<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.650> seems<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:26.980> there<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.340> two<00:03:27.579> kind

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
pole and it seems that there is two kind

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.729 
pole and it seems that there is two kind
of<00:03:28.060> tent<00:03:28.389> poles<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.019> other<00:03:29.409> ones<00:03:29.829> are<00:03:30.159> from

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
of tent poles and other ones are from

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.460 
of tent poles and other ones are from
glass<00:03:32.739> fiber<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:34.030> one<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.049> had<00:03:35.319> is

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
glass fiber and the one that I had is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.399 
glass fiber and the one that I had is
made<00:03:35.709> from<00:03:35.949> aluminium<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.659> pole<00:03:38.169> is

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
made from aluminium and the pole is

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.039 
made from aluminium and the pole is
basically<00:03:39.069> in<00:03:39.819> five<00:03:40.120> sections<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.959> it's

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
basically in five sections and it's

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.030 
basically in five sections and it's
already<00:03:42.269> painted<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.810> shape<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.139> you<00:03:44.889> are

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
already painted the shape that you are

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.619 
already painted the shape that you are
now<00:03:45.669> seeing<00:03:45.970> here<00:03:46.449> so<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:46.989> easy<00:03:47.560> to

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
now seeing here so it's really easy to

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.580 
now seeing here so it's really easy to
set<00:03:49.629> this<00:03:49.840> up<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.949> would<00:03:51.790> say<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.329> as<00:03:53.229> you<00:03:53.409> can

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
set this up I would say that as you can

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.559 
set this up I would say that as you can
see<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.949> took<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.430> one<00:03:54.729> minute<00:03:54.909> to<00:03:55.239> set<00:03:55.419> this

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
see it took like one minute to set this

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.409 
see it took like one minute to set this
up<00:03:55.629> completely<00:03:56.199> so<00:03:56.560> if<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.729> are<00:03:57.849> hurry<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.269> get

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
up completely so if you are hurry to get

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.530 
up completely so if you are hurry to get
to<00:03:58.599> sleep<00:03:58.810> well<00:03:59.409> this<00:04:00.069> is<00:04:00.190> no<00:04:00.400> brainer<00:04:00.760> well

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
to sleep well this is no brainer well

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.390 
to sleep well this is no brainer well
this<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.919> compromise<00:04:03.489> between<00:04:05.400> wave

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
this is a like compromise between wave

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.129 
this is a like compromise between wave
and<00:04:06.959> pack<00:04:07.959> size<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.560> course<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:10.540> inside

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
and pack size and of course the inside

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.729 
and pack size and of course the inside
room<00:04:12.299> there<00:04:13.299> isn't<00:04:13.659> really<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.019> much<00:04:14.229> room

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
room there isn't really that much room

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.529 
room there isn't really that much room
that<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.699> hope<00:04:16.630> will<00:04:17.019> rise<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.889> ceiling<00:04:18.539> to

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
that the hope will rise to ceiling to

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.670 
that the hope will rise to ceiling to
somewhere<00:04:19.930> like<00:04:19.989> 40<00:04:20.590> centimeters<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:22.680> it's

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
somewhere like 40 centimeters and it's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.709 
somewhere like 40 centimeters and it's
enough<00:04:24.099> if<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.520> are<00:04:24.700> if<00:04:24.969> you<00:04:25.120> want<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.510> read<00:04:25.690> a

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:25.719 
enough if you are if you want to read a

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:26.800 
enough if you are if you want to read a
book

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
book

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.560 
book
maybe<00:04:27.470> eat<00:04:27.830> something<00:04:28.430> or<00:04:28.640> maybe<00:04:29.210> watch

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
maybe eat something or maybe watch

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.950 
maybe eat something or maybe watch
YouTube<00:04:30.110> videos<00:04:30.500> from<00:04:30.860> your<00:04:31.100> mobile<00:04:31.960> device

YouTube videos from your mobile device

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.900 
YouTube videos from your mobile device
but<00:04:34.210> if<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.480> are<00:04:35.660> spending<00:04:35.990> enough<00:04:36.620> or<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:37.550> lot

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
but if you are spending enough or a lot

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.160 
but if you are spending enough or a lot
of<00:04:38.060> time<00:04:38.330> in<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:38.840> one<00:04:39.140> it's<00:04:39.490> really<00:04:40.490> boring

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
of time in this one it's really boring

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.270 
of time in this one it's really boring
in<00:04:42.170> a<00:04:42.290> camping<00:04:42.770> sense<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:45.800> only<00:04:46.040> a

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
in a camping sense so this is only a

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.630 
in a camping sense so this is only a
basically<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> system<00:04:47.690> where<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.260> go<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.980> sleep

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
basically a system where you go to sleep

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.410 
basically a system where you go to sleep
and<00:04:50.570> nothing<00:04:50.900> else<00:04:51.260> so<00:04:51.440> if<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.910> if<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.210> go

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
and nothing else so if you if you go

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.000 
and nothing else so if you if you go
with<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.840> one<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:54.140> really<00:04:54.380> don't<00:04:54.710> have<00:04:54.950> a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
with this one you really don't have a

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.790 
with this one you really don't have a
shelter<00:04:55.660> unless<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.840> are<00:04:56.960> willing<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.470> lie<00:04:57.590> in

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
shelter unless you are willing to lie in

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.790 
shelter unless you are willing to lie in
your<00:04:57.980> sleeping<00:04:58.250> pack<00:04:59.110> every<00:05:00.110> time<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.500> starts

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
your sleeping pack every time it starts

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.000 
your sleeping pack every time it starts
raining<00:05:00.980> so<00:05:02.080> like<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.260> said<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.980> a

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
raining so like I said it is a

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.450 
raining so like I said it is a
compromise<00:05:04.460> but<00:05:05.020> there<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.170> also<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.830> fact<00:05:07.280> to

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
compromise but there is also the fact to

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.150 
compromise but there is also the fact to
configure<00:05:07.910> that<00:05:08.120> if<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.140> starts<00:05:09.590> raining<00:05:09.650> and

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
configure that if it starts raining and

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.070 
configure that if it starts raining and
you<00:05:10.220> want<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.700> get<00:05:10.880> in<00:05:11.090> or<00:05:11.270> out<00:05:11.390> from<00:05:11.990> the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
you want to get in or out from the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.960 
you want to get in or out from the
bb-back<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.920> you<00:05:12.980> don't<00:05:13.220> have<00:05:13.400> any<00:05:13.550> kind<00:05:13.880> of

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
bb-back and you don't have any kind of

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.660 
bb-back and you don't have any kind of
top<00:05:14.240> or<00:05:14.450> shelter<00:05:14.870> well<00:05:15.560> it's<00:05:15.770> really<00:05:16.040> hard<00:05:16.160> to

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
top or shelter well it's really hard to

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.020 
top or shelter well it's really hard to
keep<00:05:16.910> your<00:05:17.780> sleeping<00:05:18.320> bag<00:05:18.680> back<00:05:19.130> on<00:05:19.460> well<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
keep your sleeping bag back on well the

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.720 
keep your sleeping bag back on well the
interior<00:05:20.570> of<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.870> pcpd<00:05:21.440> back<00:05:21.740> from<00:05:22.520> getting

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
interior of the pcpd back from getting

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.900 
interior of the pcpd back from getting
wet<00:05:23.150> but<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.230> really<00:05:24.470> easily<00:05:27.340> mended<00:05:28.340> by

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
wet but this is really easily mended by

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.720 
wet but this is really easily mended by
having<00:05:29.330> some<00:05:29.600> kind<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:30.080> debt<00:05:30.290> say<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.590> rain<00:05:31.370> cape

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
having some kind of debt say a rain cape

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.660 
having some kind of debt say a rain cape
or<00:05:31.970> something<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:33.770> can<00:05:33.980> use<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.430> east

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
or something and you can use that east

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
need to sleep in and out of the

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.350 
need to sleep in and out of the
immediate<00:05:36.740> back<00:05:37.100> putting<00:05:37.400> again<00:05:37.640> if<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.120> have

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
immediate back putting again if you have

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.770 
immediate back putting again if you have
a<00:05:38.530> rain<00:05:39.530> cave<00:05:39.890> you<00:05:40.160> can<00:05:40.370> as<00:05:40.520> well<00:05:40.760> just<00:05:41.120> use

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
a rain cave you can as well just use

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.150 
a rain cave you can as well just use
that<00:05:42.080> as<00:05:42.350> a<00:05:42.380> top<00:05:42.730> anyhow<00:05:44.350> it<00:05:45.350> is<00:05:45.410> a<00:05:45.560> little<00:05:46.010> bit

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
that as a top anyhow it is a little bit

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.450 
that as a top anyhow it is a little bit
tricky<00:05:46.670> but<00:05:46.820> it's<00:05:47.060> doable<00:05:47.920> well<00:05:48.920> the<00:05:49.130> basic

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
tricky but it's doable well the basic

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.280 
tricky but it's doable well the basic
structure<00:05:49.970> is<00:05:50.000> really<00:05:50.330> simple<00:05:50.840> as<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:51.140> can

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
structure is really simple as you can

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.120 
structure is really simple as you can
see<00:05:51.500> we<00:05:51.830> have<00:05:52.040> two<00:05:52.280> big<00:05:52.550> sips<00:05:53.170> that<00:05:54.170> are<00:05:54.440> behind

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
see we have two big sips that are behind

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.440 
see we have two big sips that are behind
very<00:05:55.840> very<00:05:56.840> wide<00:05:57.200> stone<00:05:57.770> flap<00:05:58.130> so<00:05:58.460> there<00:05:59.060> is<00:05:59.240> no

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
very very wide stone flap so there is no

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.540 
very very wide stone flap so there is no
worry<00:05:59.720> that<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.380> water<00:06:00.770> will<00:06:01.040> get<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.430> the

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
worry that the water will get to the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.120 
worry that the water will get to the
seeps<00:06:01.790> and<00:06:02.000> then<00:06:02.570> seek<00:06:03.050> inside<00:06:03.650> to<00:06:03.860> be<00:06:03.980> deep

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
seeps and then seek inside to be deep

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.260 
seeps and then seek inside to be deep
back<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.840> also<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:06.260> stone<00:06:06.560> flaps<00:06:06.890> have<00:06:07.400> this

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
back and also the stone flaps have this

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:16.030 
back and also the stone flaps have this
pop<00:06:08.630> lock<00:06:10.240> pop<00:06:11.240> lock<00:06:12.160> security<00:06:13.160> things<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:15.500> you

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
pop lock pop lock security things so you

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.630 
pop lock pop lock security things so you
can<00:06:16.070> either<00:06:16.400> use<00:06:16.640> the<00:06:17.450> zips<00:06:18.020> or<00:06:18.260> the<00:06:19.190> pop<00:06:19.370> locks

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
can either use the zips or the pop locks

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.080 
can either use the zips or the pop locks
and<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.860> baby<00:06:22.070> pack<00:06:22.340> you<00:06:22.460> also<00:06:22.550> have<00:06:22.880> these

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
and the baby pack you also have these

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.630 
and the baby pack you also have these
six<00:06:23.690> ground<00:06:24.230> loops<00:06:24.560> that<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:24.920> can<00:06:25.190> Hank<00:06:25.430> at

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
six ground loops that you can Hank at

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.290 
six ground loops that you can Hank at
the<00:06:25.730> pivot<00:06:26.030> back<00:06:26.210> in<00:06:26.510> place<00:06:26.810> so<00:06:26.840> if<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.740> are

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
the pivot back in place so if you are

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.270 
the pivot back in place so if you are
basically<00:06:29.300> moving<00:06:29.960> around<00:06:30.530> inside<00:06:30.860> your

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
basically moving around inside your

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.090 
basically moving around inside your
pivot<00:06:31.580> back<00:06:31.730> while<00:06:32.570> asleep<00:06:32.840> it<00:06:33.230> stays<00:06:33.890> in

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
pivot back while asleep it stays in

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.400 
pivot back while asleep it stays in
place<00:06:34.300> also<00:06:35.300> what<00:06:35.480> what<00:06:35.960> makes<00:06:36.200> this

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
place also what what makes this

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.100 
place also what what makes this
excellent<00:06:36.919> choice<00:06:37.160> is<00:06:37.970> that<00:06:38.030> this<00:06:38.450> has<00:06:38.720> a

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
excellent choice is that this has a

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.550 
excellent choice is that this has a
ketonet<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:41.720> don't<00:06:41.930> need<00:06:42.050> a<00:06:42.110> separate

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
ketonet so you don't need a separate

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.089 
ketonet so you don't need a separate
mosquito<00:06:43.400> net<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:44.169> the<00:06:45.169> mosquito<00:06:45.710> net<00:06:45.889> is

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
mosquito net and the mosquito net is

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.369 
mosquito net and the mosquito net is
easily<00:06:46.699> basically<00:06:47.830> operate<00:06:48.830> a<00:06:48.860> pool<00:06:49.159> because

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:50.379 
easily basically operate a pool because

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:57.179 
easily basically operate a pool because
you<00:06:51.379> basically<00:06:51.860> have<00:06:52.310> to<00:06:52.610> use<00:06:53.259> one<00:06:54.259> zipper<00:06:54.680> and

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.909 

basically<00:06:58.189> the<00:06:58.930> mosquito<00:06:59.930> net<00:07:00.110> folds<00:07:00.560> away

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
basically the mosquito net folds away

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:06.670 
basically the mosquito net folds away
and<00:07:02.050> you<00:07:03.050> can<00:07:03.349> just<00:07:03.650> use<00:07:03.949> these<00:07:04.219> tacos<00:07:04.930> to<00:07:05.930> roll

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
and you can just use these tacos to roll

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.600 
and you can just use these tacos to roll
into<00:07:06.889> place<00:07:07.490> so<00:07:08.439> release<00:07:09.439> to<00:07:09.830> use<00:07:09.979> it's<00:07:10.280> really

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
into place so release to use it's really

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.339 
into place so release to use it's really
simple<00:07:10.819> I<00:07:11.090> don't<00:07:11.300> really<00:07:11.629> want<00:07:11.840> to<00:07:11.960> go<00:07:12.169> with

simple I don't really want to go with

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.800 
simple I don't really want to go with
the<00:07:12.500> details<00:07:12.889> as<00:07:13.039> you<00:07:13.159> can<00:07:13.310> see<00:07:13.599> from<00:07:14.599> the

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
the details as you can see from the

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.559 
the details as you can see from the
video<00:07:14.960> well<00:07:15.949> you<00:07:16.370> can<00:07:16.520> see<00:07:16.639> how<00:07:16.789> it<00:07:16.969> works<00:07:17.270> oh
