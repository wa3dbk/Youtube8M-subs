other than streaming and the reason I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.610 
other than streaming and the reason I
say<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.329> is<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.079> price<00:02:52.319> point

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620

it's coming in at 90 pounded in the UK

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.300 
it's coming in at 90 pounded in the UK
good<00:02:55.680> price<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.519> 150<00:02:57.450> dollars<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.230> US<00:02:58.560> not

good price is 150 dollars in the US not

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.580 
good price is 150 dollars in the US not
so<00:02:59.579> good<00:02:59.790> price<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.750> compare<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.290> other

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the reason I say that is because the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.000 
the reason I say that is because the
Apple<00:03:12.420> TVs<00:03:12.780> got<00:03:12.959> additional<00:03:13.200> services<00:03:13.829> in
