have<00:02:27.860> any<00:02:28.010> trouble<00:02:28.480> putting<00:02:29.480> an<00:02:29.630> engine<00:02:29.810> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
have any trouble putting an engine and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
have any trouble putting an engine and
that<00:02:30.350> get<00:02:30.740> some<00:02:30.890> very<00:02:31.100> good<00:02:31.280> ventilation<00:02:32.050> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
that get some very good ventilation and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.870 
that get some very good ventilation and
if<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.370> noticed<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:36.140> has<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:37.370> coincide

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
if you noticed here it has to coincide

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.500 
if you noticed here it has to coincide
with<00:02:38.150> cheese<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.610> aluminum<00:02:41.270> wing

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
with cheese and to the aluminum wing

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.650 
with cheese and to the aluminum wing
pieces<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:43.310> gives<00:02:43.670> plenty<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.300> strength

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
pieces that gives plenty of strength

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.370 
pieces that gives plenty of strength
therefore<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.290> wing<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.420> wing<00:02:47.660> has<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
therefore the wing the wing has the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.360 
therefore the wing the wing has the
orange<00:02:48.680> trim<00:02:49.070> on<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.520> top<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:51.230> bottom<00:02:51.440> is

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
orange trim on the top the bottom is
