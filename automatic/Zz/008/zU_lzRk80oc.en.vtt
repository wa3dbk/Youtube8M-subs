using<00:03:59.909> bluetooth<00:04:00.650> via<00:04:01.650> Celeste<00:04:02.159> so<00:04:03.090> that's

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
using bluetooth via Celeste so that's

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.479

how bluetooth file sharing works in a
nutshell<00:04:05.699> that's<00:04:06.510> how<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.810> should<00:04:06.840> work

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
nutshell that's how it should work

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.050 
nutshell that's how it should work
however<00:04:07.440> now<00:04:08.129> it's<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.430> point<00:04:08.639> I<00:04:08.699> know<00:04:08.879> it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060
