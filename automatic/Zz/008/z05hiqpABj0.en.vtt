00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
us today we're gonna talk about the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.009 
us today we're gonna talk about the
friction<00:00:11.250> zone<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.120> motorcycle<00:00:12.780> which<00:00:12.900> is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
friction zone on the motorcycle which is

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.499 
friction zone on the motorcycle which is
what<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.380> used<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.130> start<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.969> propel<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
what you used to start to propel the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.510 
what you used to start to propel the
motorcycle<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.350> always<00:00:16.920> used<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.279> same

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
motorcycle I always used this same

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.820 
motorcycle I always used this same
analogy<00:00:18.000> when<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.420> teaching<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:19.380> when<00:00:19.710> my

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
analogy when we're teaching that when my

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.529 
analogy when we're teaching that when my
dad<00:00:20.039> taught<00:00:20.369> me<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.699> drive<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> car

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
dad taught me how to drive a car

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
dad taught me how to drive a car
he<00:00:21.990> taught<00:00:22.199> me<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> family<00:00:22.890> pickup<00:00:23.250> truck

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
he taught me on the family pickup truck

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.460 
he taught me on the family pickup truck
well<00:00:24.090> think<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> pickup<00:00:24.960> truck<00:00:25.140> weighing

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
well think about a pickup truck weighing

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
well think about a pickup truck weighing
3,500<00:00:26.340> pounds<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.300> clutch<00:00:27.599> being<00:00:27.900> this

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
3,500 pounds and the clutch being this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
3,500 pounds and the clutch being this
big<00:00:28.410> while<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> motorcycle<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
big while on a motorcycle this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
big while on a motorcycle this
particular<00:00:30.420> motorcycle<00:00:30.840> only<00:00:31.410> weighs<00:00:31.529> 360

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
particular motorcycle only weighs 360

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
particular motorcycle only weighs 360
pounds<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.360> clutch<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.290> big<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
pounds and the clutch is this big so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
pounds and the clutch is this big so
it's<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> lot<00:00:35.370> smaller<00:00:36.000> than<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.020> clutch

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it's not a lot smaller than the clutch

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
it's not a lot smaller than the clutch
on<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.070> big<00:00:38.370> truck<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> weight

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
on a big truck like that but the weight

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
on a big truck like that but the weight
difference<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> motorcycle<00:00:41.730> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
difference on the motorcycle is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.819 
difference on the motorcycle is
completely<00:00:42.300> different<00:00:42.540> he<00:00:43.170> used<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> tell<00:00:43.649> me

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
completely different he used to tell me

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
completely different he used to tell me
don't<00:00:43.980> slip<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.700> clutch<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.239> you're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
don't slip my clutch because you're

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.760 
don't slip my clutch because you're
gonna<00:00:45.480> burn<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> I'll<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.620> buy<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
gonna burn it up and I'll have to buy a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.010 
gonna burn it up and I'll have to buy a
new<00:00:46.980> clutch<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> motorcycle<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.809> find

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
new clutch all on a motorcycle to find

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
new clutch all on a motorcycle to find
the<00:00:49.140> friction<00:00:49.350> zone<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.430> ride<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the friction zone and to ride a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
the friction zone and to ride a
motorcycle<00:00:50.910> slowly<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> parking<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
motorcycle slowly in a parking lot you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.650 
motorcycle slowly in a parking lot you
actually<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> slip<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> clutch<00:00:54.329> for

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
actually have to slip the clutch for

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.630 
actually have to slip the clutch for
stability<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.710> having<00:00:55.949> said<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> we're

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
stability so having said that we're

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.670 
stability so having said that we're
going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> show<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> how<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.530> I'm

motorcycle rock back against that curb
stone<00:01:44.610> he's<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> few<00:01:46.140> times

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
stone he's going to do this a few times

to<00:01:46.649> start<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> feel<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.390> friction<00:01:48.390> zone<00:01:48.420> some

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to start to feel that friction zone some

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
to start to feel that friction zone some
people<00:01:49.500> call<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.710> friction<00:01:50.340> zone<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.729> sweet

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
people call that friction zone the sweet

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.469 
people call that friction zone the sweet
spot<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> essence<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.390> riding<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
spot and this is the essence of riding a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
spot and this is the essence of riding a
motorcycle<00:01:54.619> slowly<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.920> parking<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
motorcycle slowly in a parking lot I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.660 
motorcycle slowly in a parking lot I
would<00:01:57.509> tell<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> took

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
would tell you to do this a lot and took

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
would tell you to do this a lot and took
in<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> beginning<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.540> learning<00:02:00.719> how<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> ride

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
in the beginning of learning how to ride

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
in the beginning of learning how to ride
a<00:02:01.290> motorcycle<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.340> become<00:02:02.670> familiar

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
a motorcycle so you can become familiar

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.510 
a motorcycle so you can become familiar
with<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.600> sweet<00:02:04.200> spot<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> move

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
with that sweet spot and how to move

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.690 
with that sweet spot and how to move
that<00:02:05.700> motorcycle

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
that motorcycle

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.210 
that motorcycle
now<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.940> we've<00:02:09.349> understood<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> concept<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
now that we've understood the concept of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430 
now that we've understood the concept of
friction<00:02:11.760> zone<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.330> move<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.750> motorcycle

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
friction zone to move the motorcycle

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
friction zone to move the motorcycle
we're<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.160> move<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.760> next<00:02:14.970> step

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
we're going to move up to the next step

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300 
we're going to move up to the next step
which<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.629> actually<00:02:16.170> moving<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.620> motorcycle

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
which is actually moving the motorcycle

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.729 
which is actually moving the motorcycle
in<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:18.209> circle<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.870> we're<00:02:19.260> going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.470> call<00:02:19.680> that

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
in a circle and we're going to call that

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.010 
in a circle and we're going to call that
