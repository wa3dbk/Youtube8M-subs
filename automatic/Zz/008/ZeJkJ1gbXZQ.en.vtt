00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 welcome on how do we do 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.830
 Today we will do all 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.769
 chocolate soufflé 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.570
 let's go for the recipe in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.009
 first time we will put 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.900
 bain-marie then in front of marie this time 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.000
 it's a pan filled with water you 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 put another pan on top and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 you put ingredients the 9th 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.670
 Pans which initially or 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.670
 to put 100 g of dark chocolate 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.550
 we will put 20 g of cocoa powder 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:42.600
 in the same saucepan and in a bain-marie 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:46.309
 then we will put 30 g of butter with the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.840
 chocolate and cocoa powder 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:57.050
 good time that this preparation melts 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.050
 we will go up the two whites in snow 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.469
 so two white snow we go 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.080
 mounted then either using a robot 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.430
 you can also do good hand 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.560
 it may make a little noise 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.770
 can be cut the video stops too 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770
 noise 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.740
 we will add 20 g 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740
 no 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.430
 you will have five grams left 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.590
 will serve to put in your molds 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.420
 the whites are perfectly mounted on 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.230
 will set them aside waiting for that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.230
 the butter and chocolate preparation 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.300
 cocoa powder finish melting during 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.810
 this time we will prepare the little ones 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.820
 molds 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 so for that prepared a little bit of 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.010
 melted butter in addition to the original butter 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.300
 come put butter everywhere then we 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.979
 take a bite like that huh 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 well smooth because otherwise if you me 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.810
 take moles with ledges 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.830
 sarists of approached and and your blasted does 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 will not rise so especially slayer 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.560
 correctly then with the south kivu remains 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.800
 we coming to take a little bit and we 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.830
 just sift a little bit the mold with 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.890
 the sugar that takes away the surplus has 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.170
 do the same with the second ball the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.700
 chocolate milk chocolate and butter 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.610
 are now melted gold to add 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.610
 the two egg yolks and we are going to mix 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.610
 quietly 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.610
 we go after 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.300
 incorporate the whites for the fact 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.300
 go up beforehand then we will put 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.790
 after in the fridge for a good half 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.010
 hour or an hour before cooking 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.690
 so it's a recipe you can make 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.960
 must know it can be done 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.540
 Eve 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.820
 you leave your sous flux in the fridge and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.440
 and you take you pick you 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.730
 resume the next day and it's going great 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.990
 well 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.150
 it's a recipe you can make 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.120
 so watch it can help moms 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.870
 your aunt do not want to understand other 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.640
 time well managed the chocolate the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.340
 target well this mix and will have now 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:50.840
 he then quietly added the eggs 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.180
 in snow without breaking the whites at the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.220
 whites in snow I would say socialize them 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.360
 snow white without rica so it's 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.040
 to not break it we go up we go down 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.330
 at the word we go down while informing 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.000
 so it can take a little bit of 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.660
 time so to avoid that the video is 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.790
 too long 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.440
 I'm going to what I'm going to 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.560
 cut a little bit so I saw 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.440
 really not complicated we go up on 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 go down we go up we go down and you 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:25.000
 do that until there is 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.000
 more than two whites in snow 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.200
 I finish the mix is my preparation 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.200
 I 'm coming back to you 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.270
 we can consider it a bit like 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.330
 if we made a chocolate mousse 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:50.819
 it's a bit the same principle except that 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:53.789
 we go there leather you see the dough 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.280
 begins to become well smooth we feel 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.199
 that she is ashamed 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.380
 presto foamy it's trend that 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.500
 must then obviously like all puffed 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:12.389
 sappers fall I reassure you it happens 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:13.889
 it happens to me but hey if we follow well if 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.630
 we follow the recipe that we do everything 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:21.449
 as it normally it takes to 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:23.909
 less the time of sharjah so here 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.060
 now we have more than to fill the 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.060
 molds 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.360
 so we do not fill it with filled 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.900
 three-quarters 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.009
 we must obviously leave the material 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.009
 to make it swell 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:14.600
 here you can leave your children 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.330
 licking the coat can guarantee you 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.520
 that they are going to feast here and we put 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.940
 in the fridge for at least a 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.980
 half an hour before cooking 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.830
 preheat your oven to 200 ° 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.970
 that the fund is hot and a body 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.690
 poetry the chocolate soufflé during 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.690
 about 10 minutes 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:53.139
 and that's the result the second is 

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:56.039
 still in process good appetite and see you soon 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.039
 on how do we do
