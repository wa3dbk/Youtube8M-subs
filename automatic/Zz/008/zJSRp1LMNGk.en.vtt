following a path or and then she sees
something<00:01:00.920> not<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.640> kosher<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
something not so kosher going on on that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.420 
something not so kosher going on on that
Bush<00:01:05.549> over<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> drew<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> piece

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
Bush over there so I drew like a piece

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
Bush over there so I drew like a piece
of<00:01:08.460> fabric<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.479> stained<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.780> blood

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
of fabric that was stained with blood

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
of fabric that was stained with blood
and<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.340> thought<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.470> was<00:01:13.470> walking<00:01:13.650> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and I just thought like I was walking in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.450 
and I just thought like I was walking in
the<00:01:14.100> woods<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.720> saw<00:01:16.260> that<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.950> looks<00:01:17.250> like

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the woods and I saw that it looks like

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.969 
the woods and I saw that it looks like
someone<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> maybe<00:01:19.530> running

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
someone was kind of maybe running

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
someone was kind of maybe running
through<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> forest<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.689> something<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.860> then

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
through the forest or something and then

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
through the forest or something and then
like<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.210> piece<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.630> clothing<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.619> ripped<00:01:25.920> off

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
like a piece of clothing got ripped off

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
like a piece of clothing got ripped off
