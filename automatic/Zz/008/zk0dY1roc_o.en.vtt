00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello in this short video i 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 I want to invite you to think about one 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.519
 simple thing is it possible to change another 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.070
 human 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.469
 Well if so then to think soberly 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.880
 probably everyone comes to mind that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 if possible then it is not so easy 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.680
 because otherwise we would have all our 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 loved ones like this laid out on the shelves and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.189
 by changing them as much as we need as 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.710
 we are comfortable because we want it as 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.189
 we like it right but since 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.689
 this does not happen and conflicts 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.829
 quite often there are probably 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.170
 there are some restrictions in our 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.360
 ability to change and another person 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.160
 change his character change his behavior 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.850
 communication style and so on so on so on 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 further and you know actually have 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.329
 just three things you need to know 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 who wants to approach change 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.719
 relationship to repair their relationship with 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.710
 a loved one with the more resisting 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.850
 to change another person 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 because unconsciously 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 almost all people want first 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 turn 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.040
 something from others yes and enough 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 a small percentage of the rally thinks about 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 is that change must begin yourself but 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.340
 even if the date is thought it is only 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 here at the level of reason 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.460
 and when emotions take effect we are all 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.740
 shout you blame you wrong yes 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.420
 only then when I am mass nhl and here 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.210
 we can think a little and 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
 think where is it all the same I was wrong 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 or was wrong 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.659
 so here change the character behavior and 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.390
 even another person's personality is very 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.400
 even possible but only in three 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.340
 specific cases about which I already 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.130
 said the first and foremost when 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.200
 another person just wants to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.590
 change and in the same direction 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.470
 where would you like to orient it 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.780
 that is, your aspirations match you 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.780
 want him to change and he is exactly like that 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.660
 wants to change and is ready to do it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.619
 for yourselves for your sake some more radio 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.440
 another reason is the best deal 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.570
 naturally you understand yes and if he 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.519
 eat sooner or later you will reach 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.830
 the change you need and everything will be 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.410
 okay first case scenario 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.750
 not so rainbow anymore when you want 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.269
 make your loved one start doing 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.300
 this this this this I and lead a little 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.340
 in another way he is categorically not with you 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.870
 I agree he does not want it let's 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.590
 suppose he has his own 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.420
 reasons does not want so does not want can you 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.610
 you in this case initiate 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.430
 change and fix it up to make it 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.530
 stayed as strange as you can but 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.019
 only if you have 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.799
 certain pressure levers on this 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.980
 man either he for some reason 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.440
 become inflamed 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.230
 and such a change on his part will not 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.600
 sincere and will not be true and will not be 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.290
 permanent that is most likely it 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.480
 will just imitation change yes and how 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.370
 only you stop pushing it or 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.049
 as soon as he stops fearing you 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.200
 naturally this change 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.370
 there is no good example of such 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.730
 changes are unfulfilled promises 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.280
 data under pressure promise me that you 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.600
 no longer do so he thinks and 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.150
 He speaks 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.250
 walked promise maybe he even sincerely 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.620
 intends to do this given at the very 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.460
 Actually it is not his desire that you are his 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.140
 forced to somehow promise and 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.060
 Naturally such promises are very rare 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.650
 fulfilled and when the promise is not 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.510
 performed of course arises 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.000
 conflict keep this in mind when you 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.070
 forcing someone to make you a promise or 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.990
 somehow the third will change 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.680
 option oddly enough too 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.320
 likely in case you are a master 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.510
 communication and you can do so 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.940
 so that a person who does not want this 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.850
 moment no from opinions suddenly their 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.000
 wanted and wanted us just now 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.710
 began to do for this some 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.260
 his own steps yes he has 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.860
 there was a motivation is of course the highest 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.500
 aerobatics 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.750
 and if you can do it for sure 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.270
 you absolutely don't need my videos 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.270
 if not you must understand that when 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.150
 you want to motivate someone you must 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.830
 very well understand that in principle 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.530
 can we do this man why is he not 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.850
 can never do because we all 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.640
 developing in a certain corridor and 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.710
 as we would not like to think otherwise 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.260
 we have the possibility of development only 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.630
 part of this corridor that is you are not 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.990
 you can make a spanish ballerina 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.910
 a flyer yes and if you are a spanish flyer you 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.080
 you can't be a ballerina just because 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:53.050
 what's inside your essence is that you 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.910
 want to fly yes and either you want 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.860
 dance we all have 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.440
 internally that what drives us in 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.570
 certain side and with all our 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.160
 desire or with all the desire of our 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.750
 close people or some other people 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.120
 who will want us for something 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.700
 motivate we change our essence not 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.130
 we can understand this well and if 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.080
 you say you know your essence you know 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.569
 which sides you can change 1 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.879
 him from here and if you want to change to whom 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.599
 then you need to be very attentive 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:26.090
 to see the frames in which this 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.000
 man can in principle develop and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.819
 do not pull him by the ears where he is nothing 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.710
 does not shine but if you basically 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.080
 observant and can predict what 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.080
 I would like this person yes that is 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.620
 if you can see him better 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.289
 his essence and his true needs 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.990
 then under your strict guidance he 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.509
 will change very very productive 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.280
 Moreover, he will be grateful to you because 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.219
 tell me what you tell 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.919
 and motivate him even about what he 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:00.319
 may not have dreamed as you can see everything on 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.300
 really very simple and grows 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.520
 out of good intentions 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.940
 so I wish you never 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.529
 rape your loved ones and if you 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.569
 want them to change you 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.909
 can really help them in this and 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.069
 if you do they will be happy and 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.960
 thank i say goodbye to you 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.960
 see you in the next video bye
