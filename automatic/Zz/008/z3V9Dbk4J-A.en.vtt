00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
everything up then we have x-ray which

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.639

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
after that we have speedy minor which

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.039 
after that we have speedy minor which
isn't<00:02:25.319> working<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.829> me<00:02:25.890> right<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.489> it's

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
isn't working for me right now but it's

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.250 
isn't working for me right now but it's
supposed<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:30.110> speed<00:02:31.110> up<00:02:31.290> your<00:02:31.530> mining<00:02:32.030> by<00:02:33.260> some

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
supposed to speed up your mining by some

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.050 
supposed to speed up your mining by some
type<00:02:34.859> x<00:02:35.959> 333<00:02:36.959> times<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:41.549> have<00:02:41.579> name

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
type x 333 times so that we have name

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.140 
type x 333 times so that we have name
tags<00:02:42.090> we're<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:43.470> make<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:44.010> big<00:02:44.340> ornate<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
names bigger so you can see it's bigger

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.330 
names bigger so you can see it's bigger
than<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:53.569> we<00:02:54.569> have<00:02:54.660> build<00:02:54.959> hack

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.040 

I<00:02:59.290> just<00:03:00.290> go<00:03:00.560> over<00:03:00.739> here<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:02.569> we<00:03:02.599> have<00:03:02.780> built

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
I just go over here so we have built

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.320 
I just go over here so we have built
hack<00:03:03.640> which<00:03:04.640> builds<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.269> 1<00:03:06.129> by<00:03:07.129> 6<00:03:07.160> tower<00:03:07.879> i<00:03:08.030> think

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
hack which builds a 1 by 6 tower i think

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.740 
hack which builds a 1 by 6 tower i think
1<00:03:08.540> by<00:03:08.690> 6<00:03:08.959> for<00:03:09.800> sure<00:03:09.980> then<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:10.879> have<00:03:11.030> nucor<00:03:11.569> which

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
1 by 6 for sure then we have nucor which

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.400 
1 by 6 for sure then we have nucor which
destroys<00:03:12.230> all<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.530> blocks<00:03:12.800> near<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.400> and

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
destroys all the blocks near you and

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.250
