know<00:01:52.500> another<00:01:52.979> example<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.700> love

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
know another example would be love

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.859 
know another example would be love
letters<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> dead

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
letters to the dead

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.209 
letters to the dead
I<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.170> buddy<00:01:55.530> reading<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I was actually buddy reading this with a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.859 
I was actually buddy reading this with a
friend<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.700> got<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> hundred<00:01:57.450> pages<00:01:57.570> in

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
friend I got about a hundred pages in

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
friend I got about a hundred pages in
and<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.530> too<00:01:58.770> many<00:01:59.100> similarities

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and there was just too many similarities

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219 
and there was just too many similarities
to<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> perks<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.360> being<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.509> wallflower<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to the perks of being a wallflower and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.200 
to the perks of being a wallflower and
so<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.860> hmm<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> couldn't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so with that just hmm I couldn't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.459 
so with that just hmm I couldn't
continue<00:02:03.509> reading<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.170> couldn't

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
continue reading because I just couldn't

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.300 
continue reading because I just couldn't
separate<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> two<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.310> mind<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.729> just

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
separate the two in my mind I just

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.130 
separate the two in my mind I just
making<00:02:06.610> comparisons<00:02:07.210> that's<00:02:07.720> never<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.990> good

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
making comparisons that's never a good

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.300 
making comparisons that's never a good
thing<00:02:08.200> when<00:02:08.380> you're<00:02:08.590> reading<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.860> book<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.190> just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
thing when you're reading a book is just

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.130 
thing when you're reading a book is just
so<00:02:09.459> similar<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.060> another<00:02:10.179> book<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.840> love

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
so similar to another book that you love

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.260 
so similar to another book that you love
here<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:11.530> constantly<00:02:12.040> making<00:02:12.520> comparisons

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
here is constantly making comparisons

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.360 
here is constantly making comparisons
and<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:14.050> had<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> shove<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.800> aside<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and so I just had to shove it aside and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.860 
and so I just had to shove it aside and
I<00:02:15.670> actually<00:02:15.850> ended<00:02:16.180> up<00:02:16.270> getting<00:02:16.420> rid<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
I actually ended up getting rid of it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.300 
I actually ended up getting rid of it
because<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.380> couldn't<00:02:17.800> separate<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> two

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
because I just couldn't separate the two

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.070 
because I just couldn't separate the two
like<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:18.610> couldn't<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.510> hit<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> big

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
like I just couldn't do it it hit a big

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.620 
like I just couldn't do it it hit a big
snag<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.770> me<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.040> had<00:02:21.220> another<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:21.940> these

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
snag for me I had another one is these

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.030 
snag for me I had another one is these
scorch<00:02:22.900> trials<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.709> one<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
scorch trials and this is one that I

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.100 
scorch trials and this is one that I
actually<00:02:24.190> was<00:02:25.000> able<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.330> power<00:02:25.510> through<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
actually was able to power through and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
actually was able to power through and
end<00:02:26.260> up<00:02:26.350> finishing<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.220> had<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.730> hardest

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
end up finishing but I had the hardest

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.220 
end up finishing but I had the hardest
time<00:02:28.270> getting<00:02:28.300> through<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.840> book<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.170> I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
time getting through this book and I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.660 
time getting through this book and I
think<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:29.500> because<00:02:29.830> it's<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.370> different

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
think it's because it's so different

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.220 
think it's because it's so different
than<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> Maze<00:02:31.270> Runner<00:02:31.300> like<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> characters

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
than the Maze Runner like the characters

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.900 
than the Maze Runner like the characters
just<00:02:32.319> go<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.890> this<00:02:33.010> really<00:02:33.430> weird<00:02:33.730> direction

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
just go in this really weird direction

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.720 
just go in this really weird direction
this<00:02:34.360> story<00:02:34.600> really<00:02:34.840> takes<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.350> weird<00:02:35.770> turn<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
this story really takes a weird turn and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.370 
this story really takes a weird turn and
I<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.940> wasn't<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.270> huge<00:02:37.450> fan<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
I just wasn't a huge fan of it and so it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.350 
I just wasn't a huge fan of it and so it
took<00:02:38.530> me<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.370> long<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.820> read<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.239> would

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
took me so long to read this I would

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.479 
took me so long to read this I would
pick<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.630> up<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:41.140> like<00:02:41.290> hey<00:02:41.530> not<00:02:42.040> feeling<00:02:42.370> it

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
pick it up be like hey not feeling it

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.940 
pick it up be like hey not feeling it
put<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:42.940> pick<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.810> don't<00:02:44.769> want<00:02:44.890> to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
put it down pick it up I don't want to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.830 
put it down pick it up I don't want to
do<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.400> think<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.760> took<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.090> read-a-thon<00:02:46.360> for

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
do it I think it took a read-a-thon for

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.270 
do it I think it took a read-a-thon for
me<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.019> actually<00:02:47.170> plow<00:02:47.560> through<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.040> book

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.390 
which I'm glad that I finally got
through<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.440> because<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.920> was<00:02:51.010> driving<00:02:51.250> me

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
