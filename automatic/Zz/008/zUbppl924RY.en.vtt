 women we are the fairies card is the end 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.399
 It is the doctrine of our being that you 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.399
 we are half now I forgive you 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.730
 to the duck 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.010
 see some people who do it 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.759
 others and then there can be some 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.920
 problem all that and how we were 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.530
 seeing in the photographs there is a lot 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.240
 people who are going on a trip and nothing else 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.770
 they give two people and they need 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.900
 take a picture together as well as 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.220
 we say with a supposed look that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.680
 it must also be a very practical way 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.170
 to show where you are clear 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.750
 before I was hearing I can take a 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.350
 photography I gave the picture great camera 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.240
 photographic and they were peeling so is you 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.550
 you were a camera that passes you holes 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.500
 now also the not nothing else is for 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.050
 comfort but also for safety 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.160
 as you mention it now that I was 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.320
 honeymoon 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.680
 all my honeymoon were pure the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.250
 fish me it is possible clear 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.450
 sorry this part where you put your reason 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.220
 the monkey by the chips the cane yes and with 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.420
 that and with the envelope you take your show that 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.790
 so I think it's more than anything 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.710
 the technology is advancing and that therefore 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.420
 now we have that facility not to take 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.100
 our place of having to ask 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.229
 someone who takes our picture you do not have 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.630
 hungry if I invite you to eat 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.300
 let's eat by and kakina from our 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.300
 yesterday I forgive you 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.190
 some people who do more and 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.790
 there then if there may be some problem 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.980
 everything in excess is wrong and as we were 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.500
 seeing in the photographs there is a lot 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.300
 people who are going on a trip and nothing else 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.190
 they give two people and they need 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.770
 take a picture together as you kill 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.750
 with a supposed look that you also see 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.080
 in a very 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.570
 practice of evidencing the place where 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.760
 you're clear before I was, can you hear me 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.550
 taking a picture they gave him the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.550
 I photograph the camera and 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.100
 they were peeling so a camera was left 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.020
 I pass holes now also not nothing 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.700
 more is for comfort but also with 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.220
 for safety as everything mentions 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.380
 Now that I was on my honeymoon 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.560
 all my honeymoon were pure is the 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.560
 fish 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.180
 sorry this part where you put your reason 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.100
 the monkey by the chip the cane yes and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.209
 with that and with this you always take yourself 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.340
 what then I think is more than 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.500
 nothing that technology is advancing and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.300
 that now we have that facility not 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.770
 to take us instead of having to ask 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.080
 someone who takes our picture does not 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.520
 you're hungry if you were invited to eat what 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.500
 let's eat 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.510
 Monica Quinoa of our being that you 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.510
 I was half now I forgave you 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:55.100
 for some people who do it 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.780
 more and then there can be some 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.490
 problem everything as we were seeing in 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.920
 the photographs there are many people who 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.810
 goes on a trip and that nothing else gives two 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.580
 people and therefore they need to take a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.010
 picture together as you assassinate him with a 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.690
 supposedly look that must also be a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.850
 very practical way of evidencing the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.700
 where you're clear before was hey 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.610
 I can take a picture they gave him 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.400
 the photograph the camera and it 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.160
 they were peeling so a camera was left like this 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 what happens to you now also the not nothing 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.030
 more is for comfort but also for 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.280
 security as you mention it now that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.200
 I was on my honeymoon 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.630
 all my honeymoon were pure 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.170
 selfish my wife and I clear so 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.170
