00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420
 is the life of chachi where is almost as 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.919
 beautiful so cute she is doing 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.919
 now report and how was that why 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.900
 after his participation in a reality show 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.810
 a movie and several fictions the 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.119
 actress chachi telesco felt something 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.060
 more was missing was happening 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.960
 for a moment of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.960
 of a lot of uncertainty 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.390
 desire to do new things 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.420
 and put my art 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.649
 in something in something more social the young 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.809
 that I need a change 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
 significant in his life and from 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.960
 then he began to develop his 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.399
 more spiritual side volunteers and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.100
 some instructors that we teach 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.120
 breathing and meditation techniques and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.910
 we do is give them 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.309
 I believe in the minds of people who 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.379
 are two or three doctors orders in 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.769
 intensive therapy to go through 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.350
 that moment in a very firm way very 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.500
 aware 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 they can be cheerful inside for more than 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.520
 what happens outside is the system today 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.500
 prioritizes her work as a volunteer 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.259
 singing acting and teaching techniques 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.830
 of breathing in hospitals, villas and 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.830
 garcé month 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.740
 yoga and meditation solidarity work this 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.740
 is the new life of chacha phone 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.060
 if he receives it and applause 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.820
 It is so radiant 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 let's talk about the sales that have 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.500
 done in hospitals in a couple of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.330
 jails but for what they were 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.070
 speaking jails not what they talked to the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.070
 principle with this serves 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.979
 a prisoner after being in jail and 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.200
 I think this is not very knowledgeable 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.060
 Private leaves with more desire to chambear 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.250
 that before because there is a lot of violence in 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 the prisons and we are going 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.569
 with art living eight years ago the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 program is called reason prison because 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.450
 is in english smart is a training 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.940
 of rehabilitation and stress control 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.200
 in jail as well as the program myself 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.940
 I took the course of art and living and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.799
 takes to hospitals and I'm an instructor 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.260
 mess with people who do not have 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.450
 freedom and they did not know nor love 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.040
 own or any kind of love in your life 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.330
 for something the sick person has 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.790
 behavior as they have it and the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560
 concrete answer or the question or better 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.950
 said the concrete question is how newly 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.140
 It is very difficult for them to improve 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.670
 I had wanted was to meet with 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.950
 people who had accumulated violence 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
 and when I went they would take violence 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.569
 from somewhere 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.099
 woman 11 I went to jail not only 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.040
 that I came across a pavilion of 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.269
 maximum security redistributed to 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.670
 make a living pavilion in 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.950
 where there are more than 40 prisoners meditating in 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.690
 silence with good behavior between 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.360
 them which previously had to be 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.519
 isolated because they were holding on 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.220
 among themselves the good thing about this is that the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.260
 people come out first there are two things there 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.160
 that separating a person who deserves is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.120
 in jail you have to enter the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.290
 jail but you are not given the medicine to 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.840
 rehabilitate to leave zero the poplars 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.180
 to heal is exactly this this 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.920
 program was carried in Ciudad Juárez in 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.560
 Mexico where there is a drug trafficking 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.780
 alarming for more than 20 years and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.209
 it works that we remember that even if 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.340
 obvious the function of imprisoning someone 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.709
 for a crime in modern society is 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.360
 What is socialized is that 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.110
 Repent that fulfills sentence that comes out 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.750
 and that capitalism is never again 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.920
 theory works but talk about living what 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.540
 What it does is take responsibility for 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.299
 this bring a program with instructors 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.490
 volunteers I am one of them and that 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.050
 seven captive 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.580
 you entered out of curiosity I imagine in the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.690
 art live and you stayed as very captured 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.820
 but we are talking because also 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.530
 it was cold something happens then you go 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.750
 out of curiosity because a friend came to me 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.850
 and he told me I was half empty in the 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.650
 environment was generating my own 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.810
 artistic content was writing 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.760
 works and it was always half the same the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.860
 people who would see me and then they 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.420
 inflated or not with respect to the applause 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.280
 the good reviews and they were half there 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.600
 it started to happen to me that I had to 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.640
 bring the art or all the talent that 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.160
 I have other places you felt empty 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.830
 of sense in losses and precisely the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.020
 complaint you come with that because it 's good to me 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.460
 missing this I'm missing and how can they steal 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.130
 in such a place as they can look at what 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.750
 they do and you never take part ovoidales I go 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.370
 to be the protagonist of these so 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.230
 when I left the course it's five days 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.660
 few hours in the day I left with a lot 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.340
 less crashed and I started Greek for myself 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.530
 I'm not doing much for Argentina or 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.240
 By the same my city wants to be with five 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.970
 service projects one was jail 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.350
 and when I went to jail it was amazing 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.910
 what I received from love I took a 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.980
 ziggurat planted for those who do not know 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.600
 It is a food plant 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.940
 planted for it an onion I got 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.440
 a hug of the safest I received 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.320
 the policemen who received me as 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.030
 guard and they and those who any 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.770
 person can go leo for example did not take 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.490
 the art course live you want to go to 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.490
 see the jail 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.150
 this is a good tool for 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.970
 Mayan life if you get involved or not with the 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:29.990
 project of a lancaster hospital 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.820

 what I am going to contribute from me already 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.880

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:52.730
 human being is the phrase that has the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.730
