structure though the zygomatic arch and

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.400 
structure though the zygomatic arch and
say<00:04:50.560> what<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.010> structure<00:04:51.310> absolutely

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.879 

mm-hmm<00:04:56.500> make<00:04:57.130> up<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.490> zygomatic<00:04:58.000> arch<00:05:01.889> you

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
mm-hmm make up the zygomatic arch you

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.520 
mm-hmm make up the zygomatic arch you
have<00:05:03.099> a<00:05:03.460> little<00:05:03.789> thing<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.270> right<00:05:05.020> here<00:05:05.289> that

I think kind of looks like an

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.570 
I think kind of looks like an
old-fashioned<00:05:07.990> jug<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.380> whiskey<00:05:09.449> that's<00:05:10.449> your

PAL teeth oh okay mandible would be the
structure<00:06:11.999> yes<00:06:12.419> okay<00:06:13.050> so<00:06:13.199> this<00:06:13.740> is<00:06:13.979> the<00:06:14.159> admit

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
structure yes okay so this is the admit

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.769 
structure yes okay so this is the admit
if<00:06:14.969> we<00:06:15.119> were<00:06:15.179> asking<00:06:15.839> the<00:06:15.929> overall<00:06:16.550> like<00:06:17.779> what

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
if we were asking the overall like what

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.529 
if we were asking the overall like what
is<00:06:18.899> the<00:06:19.050> structure<00:06:19.589> and<00:06:20.129> you<00:06:20.189> pick<00:06:21.149> this<00:06:21.330> up

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
is the structure and you pick this up

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:24.009 
is the structure and you pick this up
this<00:06:21.929> would<00:06:22.139> be<00:06:22.259> a<00:06:22.289> Mantha

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:24.019 
this would be a Mantha

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.730 
this would be a Mantha
if<00:06:25.019> you<00:06:26.179> had<00:06:27.179> what<00:06:27.539> is<00:06:27.659> the<00:06:27.779> bones<00:06:28.019> this<00:06:28.499> whole

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
if you had what is the bones this whole

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.820 
if you had what is the bones this whole
thing<00:06:29.009> is<00:06:29.369> denturri<00:06:29.909> bone<00:06:30.169> now<00:06:31.169> if<00:06:31.379> we<00:06:31.559> put<00:06:31.800> a

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
thing is denturri bone now if we put a

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.409 
thing is denturri bone now if we put a
dot<00:06:32.069> here<00:06:32.099> that's<00:06:32.819> like<00:06:32.969> what<00:06:33.179> is<00:06:33.300> the

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
dot here that's like what is the

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.189 
dot here that's like what is the
structure<00:06:33.749> be<00:06:34.110> specific<00:06:34.709> this<00:06:35.610> is<00:06:35.819> the

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
structure be specific this is the

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.519 
structure be specific this is the
coronoid<00:06:37.199> process<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:39.180> in<00:06:39.389> your<00:06:39.569> PA<00:06:39.869> z<00:06:39.990> there's

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
coronoid process so in your PA z there's

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.920 
coronoid process so in your PA z there's
a<00:06:40.759> picture<00:06:41.759> of<00:06:41.999> this<00:06:42.149> that<00:06:42.360> talks<00:06:42.539> about<00:06:42.659> the

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
a picture of this that talks about the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.309 
a picture of this that talks about the
all<00:06:43.259> the<00:06:43.289> different<00:06:43.469> processes<00:06:44.329> so<00:06:45.329> make<00:06:46.289> sure

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
all the different processes so make sure

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.019 
all the different processes so make sure
you<00:06:46.589> take<00:06:46.769> a<00:06:46.800> look<00:06:46.979> at<00:06:47.159> that<00:06:47.339> I<00:06:47.550> don't<00:06:47.819> have<00:06:47.939> it

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.029 
you take a look at that I don't have it

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.059 
you take a look at that I don't have it
up<00:06:48.119> here<00:06:48.149> right<00:06:48.360> now<00:06:48.419> but<00:06:48.719> and<00:06:49.319> then<00:06:49.769> the<00:06:49.889> other

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.069 
up here right now but and then the other

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.309 
up here right now but and then the other
thing<00:06:50.369> is<00:06:50.550> the<00:06:50.969> jaw<00:06:51.149> joint<00:06:51.419> articulation<00:06:51.569> on

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
thing is the jaw joint articulation on

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:57.439 
thing is the jaw joint articulation on
the<00:06:52.439> cat<00:06:53.629> we<00:06:54.629> tend<00:06:54.869> to<00:06:54.930> be<00:06:55.079> kind<00:06:55.229> of<00:06:55.349> picky<00:06:56.449> so

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
the cat we tend to be kind of picky so

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.679 
the cat we tend to be kind of picky so
it's<00:06:58.319> not<00:06:58.669> like<00:06:59.669> some<00:06:59.909> people<00:07:00.179> call<00:07:00.360> this<00:07:00.479> the

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
it's not like some people call this the

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.559 
it's not like some people call this the
squamosal<00:07:01.219> in<00:07:02.219> the<00:07:02.579> reptile<00:07:02.969> this<00:07:03.329> is<00:07:03.449> the

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
squamosal in the reptile this is the

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.219 
squamosal in the reptile this is the
squamosal<00:07:04.050> bone<00:07:04.349> in<00:07:05.279> the<00:07:06.149> cat<00:07:06.360> people<00:07:06.659> you<00:07:06.929> say

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
squamosal bone in the cat people you say

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.959 
squamosal bone in the cat people you say
it's<00:07:07.409> squamosal<00:07:07.949> denturri<00:07:08.519> jaw<00:07:08.729> joint

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
it's squamosal denturri jaw joint

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:11.299 
it's squamosal denturri jaw joint
articulation<00:07:09.469> but<00:07:10.469> that's<00:07:10.709> because<00:07:11.099> there's

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:11.309 
articulation but that's because there's

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:13.249 
articulation but that's because there's
three<00:07:11.729> different<00:07:11.849> portions<00:07:12.479> of<00:07:12.629> the<00:07:12.749> temporal

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
three different portions of the temporal

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.829 
three different portions of the temporal
bone<00:07:13.909> one<00:07:14.909> of<00:07:15.029> the<00:07:15.089> portions<00:07:15.329> is<00:07:15.719> the

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:15.839 
bone one of the portions is the

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.589 
bone one of the portions is the
squamosal<00:07:16.289> portion<00:07:16.829> which<00:07:17.369> is<00:07:17.569> right<00:07:18.569> here

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 
squamosal portion which is right here

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:20.509 
squamosal portion which is right here
where<00:07:19.050> it<00:07:19.139> articulates<00:07:19.589> with<00:07:19.919> the<00:07:20.039> bottom<00:07:20.309> jaw

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:20.519 
where it articulates with the bottom jaw

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.909 
where it articulates with the bottom jaw
so<00:07:21.360> when<00:07:21.990> we're<00:07:22.139> saying<00:07:22.349> what's<00:07:22.619> the<00:07:22.709> jaw

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
so when we're saying what's the jaw

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.069 
so when we're saying what's the jaw
joint<00:07:23.189> articulation<00:07:23.339> on<00:07:23.969> this<00:07:24.119> one<00:07:24.329> we<00:07:24.869> want

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:25.079 
joint articulation on this one we want

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:29.259 
joint articulation on this one we want
squamosal<00:07:25.589> portion<00:07:26.279> of<00:07:26.429> the<00:07:26.939> temporal<00:07:27.179> bone<00:07:28.219> -

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:29.269 
squamosal portion of the temporal bone -

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:32.750 
squamosal portion of the temporal bone -
dentary

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.760 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:42.140 

squamosal<00:07:33.760> portion<00:07:34.830> of<00:07:36.120> the<00:07:37.120> temporal<00:07:37.300> bone

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:50.030 

-<00:07:43.170> dentary

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.040 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:59.010 

good<00:07:56.010> okay
