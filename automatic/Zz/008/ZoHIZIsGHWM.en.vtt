00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
later the reason I would have left my

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.200 
later the reason I would have left my
rage<00:02:40.960> is<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.650> core<00:02:42.460> has<00:02:42.730> wizard

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
rage is because this core has wizard

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.300 
rage is because this core has wizard
towers<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.630> not<00:02:43.750> mortars<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.740> it's<00:02:44.950> mortars

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
towers and not mortars if it's mortars

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.790 
towers and not mortars if it's mortars
in<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.520> core<00:02:45.730> than<00:02:45.970> raging<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:47.230> hogs<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.770> a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
in the core than raging your hogs is a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.280 
in the core than raging your hogs is a
great<00:02:48.070> way<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.310> escape<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.930> damage

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
great way to escape the damage

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.810 
great way to escape the damage
completely<00:02:50.860> because<00:02:51.250> they're<00:02:51.400> running<00:02:51.670> more

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
completely because they're running more

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.060 
completely because they're running more
faster<00:02:52.330> than<00:02:52.510> more<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.870> fire<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.860> they

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
faster than more it can fire so they

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.700 
faster than more it can fire so they
actually<00:02:54.370> don't<00:02:54.550> get<00:02:54.760> hit<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:56.350> if<00:02:56.560> you're

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
actually don't get hit but if you're

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.590 
actually don't get hit but if you're
dropping<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:57.400> he'll<00:02:58.030> slow<00:02:58.270> down<00:02:58.300> don't

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
dropping up he'll slow down don't

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.750 
dropping up he'll slow down don't
