00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
comfortable with the motion the first

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.240 
comfortable with the motion the first
one<00:00:49.270> is<00:00:49.989> we're<00:00:50.410> just<00:00:50.440> going<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.800> hang<00:00:51.010> on<00:00:51.160> the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
one is we're just going to hang on the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.500 
one is we're just going to hang on the

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
your feet through your arms and flip

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.040 
your feet through your arms and flip

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
around into a back foot pretty simple

around into a back foot pretty simple
trick<00:00:59.289> most<00:01:00.219> people<00:01:00.579> can<00:01:01.059> probably<00:01:01.270> already

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
trick most people can probably already

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.290 
trick most people can probably already
do<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.730> that's<00:01:03.820> just<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.180> get

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
do that but that's just to get

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.240 
do that but that's just to get
comfortable<00:01:04.830> initially<00:01:05.830> if<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.009> haven't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
comfortable initially if you haven't

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.570 
comfortable initially if you haven't
tried<00:01:06.340> that<00:01:06.460> before<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:08.280> flipping<00:01:09.280> around

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
tried that before with flipping around

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.160 
tried that before with flipping around
upside<00:01:09.910> down<00:01:10.119> while<00:01:10.270> hanging<00:01:10.509> on<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.899> bar

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
upside down while hanging on to a bar

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.990 
upside down while hanging on to a bar
now<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.680> next<00:01:11.979> thing<00:01:12.100> we're<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.520> do<00:01:12.729> is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
now the next thing we're going to do is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.359 
now the next thing we're going to do is
have<00:01:13.689> a<00:01:13.750> little<00:01:14.020> bit<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.439> Swing<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.010> just<00:01:15.250> do

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
have a little bit of Swing and just do

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.870 
have a little bit of Swing and just do
the<00:01:15.490> same<00:01:15.640> thing

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.630 

now<00:01:20.510> with<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:20.840> it'll<00:01:21.560> actually<00:01:21.799> swing<00:01:22.490> you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
now with that it'll actually swing you

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640 
now with that it'll actually swing you
backwards<00:01:23.150> that's<00:01:23.810> okay<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> don't<00:01:24.290> want<00:01:24.590> you

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
backwards that's okay I don't want you

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.980 
backwards that's okay I don't want you
releasing<00:01:25.250> yet<00:01:25.430> practicing<00:01:26.119> these<00:01:26.270> exercises

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
releasing yet practicing these exercises

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.899 
releasing yet practicing these exercises
just<00:01:27.470> hang<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.890> until<00:01:28.009> your<00:01:28.340> body's<00:01:28.640> all<00:01:28.790> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
just hang on until your body's all the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.880 
just hang on until your body's all the
way<00:01:29.000> through<00:01:29.330> then<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.320> land<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.619> trick

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
way through then you can land the trick

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.920 
way through then you can land the trick
difference<00:01:31.759> between<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.270> motion<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.869> the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
difference between this motion and the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.170 
difference between this motion and the
actual<00:01:33.200> fly<00:01:33.500> away<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.979> you're<00:01:34.670> going<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.970> be

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
actual fly away is you're going to be

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.539 
actual fly away is you're going to be
releasing<00:01:35.570> as<00:01:35.990> you're<00:01:36.290> swinging<00:01:36.560> gallic<00:01:37.040> and

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
releasing as you're swinging gallic and

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.609 
releasing as you're swinging gallic and
then<00:01:37.729> doing<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.180> tuck<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.720> flip<00:01:38.990> motion<00:01:39.440> as

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
then doing that tuck to flip motion as

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.249 
then doing that tuck to flip motion as
you're<00:01:40.490> watching<00:01:40.700> up<00:01:41.149> and<00:01:41.360> away<00:01:41.750> from<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.080> bar

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
you're watching up and away from the bar

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.960 
you're watching up and away from the bar
to<00:01:42.680> do<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.920> flip<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:43.759> you're<00:01:43.880> getting

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
to do the flip so as you're getting

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.639 
to do the flip so as you're getting
comfortable<00:01:44.360> with<00:01:44.509> swinging<00:01:44.960> from<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.229> bar

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
comfortable with swinging from the bar

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.190 
comfortable with swinging from the bar
and<00:01:45.770> you're<00:01:45.860> ready<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.159> start<00:01:46.310> trying<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.850> flip

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
and you're ready to start trying to flip

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.380 
and you're ready to start trying to flip
the<00:01:48.200> technique<00:01:48.619> that<00:01:48.860> is<00:01:49.009> involved<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:50.180> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
the technique that is involved is that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.050 
the technique that is involved is that
as<00:01:50.539> you're<00:01:50.720> swinging<00:01:50.990> forward<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.550> it's<00:01:52.909> all

as you're swinging forward you it's all

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.090 
as you're swinging forward you it's all
about<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.420> timing<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:53.990> when<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.259> release<00:01:54.619> if

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
about the timing of when you release if

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.800 
about the timing of when you release if
you<00:01:55.310> release<00:01:55.610> too<00:01:55.940> soon<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:56.420> you're<00:01:56.569> swinging

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
you release too soon as you're swinging

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.870 
you release too soon as you're swinging
forward<00:01:57.200> then<00:01:57.770> your<00:01:57.950> center<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.340> gravity<00:01:58.729> will

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
forward then your center of gravity will

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.850 
forward then your center of gravity will
drop<00:01:59.179> straight<00:01:59.420> into<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.869> ground<00:02:00.110> if<00:02:00.800> you

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
drop straight into the ground if you

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.580 
drop straight into the ground if you
release<00:02:01.280> too<00:02:01.550> late<00:02:01.819> then<00:02:02.509> you'll<00:02:02.720> be<00:02:03.229> kind<00:02:03.440> of

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
release too late then you'll be kind of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.559 
release too late then you'll be kind of
swinging<00:02:03.979> back<00:02:04.190> towards<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.700> bar<00:02:04.880> or<00:02:05.149> go<00:02:05.330> up

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
swinging back towards the bar or go up

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.389 
swinging back towards the bar or go up
too<00:02:05.810> much<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.770> risk<00:02:06.920> flipping<00:02:07.310> your

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
too much and you can risk flipping your

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.279 
too much and you can risk flipping your
feet<00:02:07.580> on<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.819> bar<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.720> want<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.110> make<00:02:09.259> sure

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
feet on the bar so you want to make sure

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.870 
feet on the bar so you want to make sure
you<00:02:09.590> find<00:02:09.769> that<00:02:09.950> right<00:02:10.190> balance<00:02:10.220> where<00:02:10.759> your

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
you find that right balance where your

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.820 
you find that right balance where your
feet<00:02:11.060> are<00:02:11.090> swinging<00:02:11.480> up<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.959> you're<00:02:12.440> swinging

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
feet are swinging up and you're swinging

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.130 
feet are swinging up and you're swinging
here<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.850> start<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.299> tuck<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:14.660> knees<00:02:14.900> in

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
here and you start to tuck your knees in

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.410 
here and you start to tuck your knees in
and<00:02:15.350> then<00:02:15.590> release<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.269> that

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and then release so that you have that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.270 
and then release so that you have that
momentum<00:02:17.959> going<00:02:18.200> up<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:18.830> bit<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
momentum going up a little bit and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.120 
momentum going up a little bit and
forward<00:02:20.180> send<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.900> away<00:02:20.959> from<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.350> bar<00:02:21.560> but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
forward send you away from the bar but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.740 
forward send you away from the bar but
your<00:02:22.250> center<00:02:22.519> of<00:02:22.549> gravity<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.970> still<00:02:23.299> high<00:02:23.510> so

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
your center of gravity is still high so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
your center of gravity is still high so
you<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:23.930> plenty<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.290> time<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.769> get<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.459> trick

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
you have plenty of time to get the trick

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.310 
you have plenty of time to get the trick
around<00:02:25.820> what<00:02:26.570> else<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.840> want<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.049> be<00:02:27.140> thinking

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
around what else you want to be thinking

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.920 
around what else you want to be thinking
about<00:02:27.620> as<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.100> do<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.400> trick<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.940> as<00:02:29.720> you're

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
about as you do this trick is as you're

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.440 
about as you do this trick is as you're
coming<00:02:30.590> up<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.160> start<00:02:31.400> bringing<00:02:31.670> your

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
coming up and you start bringing your

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.569 
coming up and you start bringing your
knees<00:02:32.720> towards<00:02:33.170> your<00:02:33.230> chest<00:02:33.560> think<00:02:34.310> about

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
knees towards your chest think about

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.759 
knees towards your chest think about
that<00:02:35.000> you're<00:02:35.180> tucking<00:02:35.630> towards<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.230> bar<00:02:36.470> but

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
that you're tucking towards the bar but

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.080 
that you're tucking towards the bar but
your<00:02:36.890> momentum<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.489> going<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.790> carrying

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
your momentum is going to be carrying

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.599 
your momentum is going to be carrying
you<00:02:38.239> away<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.870> bar<00:02:39.070> if<00:02:40.070> you're<00:02:40.340> still

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
you away from the bar if you're still

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.400 
you away from the bar if you're still
dropping<00:02:41.000> quite<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.450> bit<00:02:41.660> practicing<00:02:42.290> this

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
dropping quite a bit practicing this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.220 
dropping quite a bit practicing this
trick<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:43.280> might<00:02:43.880> help<00:02:44.120> if<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:44.840> actually<00:02:45.200> a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
trick it might help if you do actually a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.319 
trick it might help if you do actually a
little<00:02:45.440> bit<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.739> tug<00:02:46.040> pulling<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.120> bar

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
little bit of tug pulling on the bar

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.880 
little bit of tug pulling on the bar
this<00:02:47.570> will<00:02:47.720> actually<00:02:47.840> help<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.320> whip<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> bit

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
this will actually help you whip a bit

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.979 
this will actually help you whip a bit
faster<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.640> give<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.359> a<00:02:50.390> little<00:02:50.570> bit<00:02:50.750> more

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
faster and give you a little bit more

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.720 
faster and give you a little bit more
height<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.859> subtle<00:02:52.070> tug<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:52.579> not

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
height it's just a subtle tug it's not

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.849 
height it's just a subtle tug it's not
about<00:02:52.850> pulling<00:02:53.120> my<00:02:53.420> body<00:02:53.600> into<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.170> bar<00:02:54.350> it's

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
about pulling my body into the bar it's

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.250 
about pulling my body into the bar it's
just<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.220> little<00:02:55.430> jerk<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.510> gives<00:02:56.720> me<00:02:56.870> extra

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
just a little jerk that gives me extra

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.410 
just a little jerk that gives me extra
momentum<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:58.750> rotation<00:02:59.750> to<00:03:00.140> do

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
momentum and rotation to do

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.720 
momentum and rotation to do
trick<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.440> after<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.860> release<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.490> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
trick so after the release and the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.670 
trick so after the release and the
checking<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.209> your<00:03:03.360> knees<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:04.050> can<00:03:04.230> tuck<00:03:04.470> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
checking of your knees you can tuck it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.830 
checking of your knees you can tuck it
you<00:03:05.069> can<00:03:05.220> lay<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.520> out<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.209> main<00:03:06.420> thing<00:03:06.690> is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
you can lay it out the main thing is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
you can lay it out the main thing is
that<00:03:06.870> you're<00:03:07.200> getting<00:03:07.530> around<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.130> you're

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
that you're getting around and you're

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.120 
that you're getting around and you're
able<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.060> spot<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> ground<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.440> open<00:03:10.770> up<00:03:10.890> and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
able to spot the ground to open up and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.309 
able to spot the ground to open up and
land<00:03:11.670> successfully<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.900> when<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.080> have<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
land successfully so when you have the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.290 
land successfully so when you have the
fly<00:03:13.590> away<00:03:13.800> down<00:03:14.010> with<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> tuck<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.209> you're

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
fly away down with the tuck and you're

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.729 
fly away down with the tuck and you're
ready<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.569> do<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.260> lay<00:03:16.440> out<00:03:16.560> it's

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
ready to do it into the lay out it's

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.410 
ready to do it into the lay out it's
going<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.950> be<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.100> little<00:03:17.340> bit<00:03:17.520> different<00:03:17.970> but

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
going to be a little bit different but

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.120 
going to be a little bit different but
it's<00:03:18.569> mostly<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.080> same<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> release<00:03:19.890> and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
it's mostly the same in the release and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.309 
it's mostly the same in the release and
lunch<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.910> only<00:03:21.120> difference<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.200> be

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
lunch the only difference is going to be

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.920 
lunch the only difference is going to be
in<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.560> swing<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.190> how<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.910> whip<00:03:24.510> your<00:03:24.720> body

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
layout to come around and land the trick

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.059 
layout to come around and land the trick
and<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:01.110> while<00:04:01.350> you're<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> layout<00:04:01.950> you

and then while you're in the layout you

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.559 
and then while you're in the layout you
just<00:04:02.340> want<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.610> make<00:04:02.730> sure<00:04:02.760> you've<00:04:03.030> had<00:04:03.209> enough

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
just want to make sure you've had enough

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.780 
just want to make sure you've had enough
momentum<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.769> flip<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.070> all<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.310> way<00:04:05.430> around

momentum to flip you all the way around

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.660 
momentum to flip you all the way around
and<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.600> just<00:04:06.810> comes<00:04:06.989> through<00:04:07.489> practicing<00:04:08.489> a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
and that just comes through practicing a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.150 
and that just comes through practicing a
fast<00:04:09.030> whip<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.959> faster<00:04:10.410> rotation<00:04:10.530> with<00:04:10.980> this

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
fast whip and faster rotation with this

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.979 
fast whip and faster rotation with this
trick<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.790> trick<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.060> be<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.329> scary<00:04:12.570> one<00:04:12.780> to

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
trick this trick can be a scary one to

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.509 
trick this trick can be a scary one to
learn<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.410> actually<00:04:13.530> learned<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.010> one<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.459> a

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
learn I actually learned this one in a

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.270 
learn I actually learned this one in a
gym<00:04:14.820> into<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.329> foam<00:04:15.600> pit<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.530> think<00:04:17.100> that's

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
gym into a foam pit and I think that's

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.219 
gym into a foam pit and I think that's
one<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> best<00:04:17.820> options<00:04:18.090> for<00:04:18.419> those<00:04:18.989> who

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
one of the best options for those who

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.170 
one of the best options for those who
really<00:04:19.890> want<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> learn<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.310> trick<00:04:20.700> safely

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
but otherwise it just reaches a certain

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.550 
but otherwise it just reaches a certain
point<00:04:23.880> where<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.870> go<00:04:25.229> for<00:04:25.470> it
