 head to face them for how much

 basic such a structure from 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.630

 and hours of doing better desperately 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.630
 tends to lose interest and is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 necessary to lure it between the coils of the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.469

 when now the new class introduced 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 after the release it turned out even more 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.660
 fun to use than the two basic

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.990
 hunt 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.610
 the powerful mustache of your partner 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.170
 adventures are not enough, however 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 far from trouble and in just a few 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.990
 minutes you will be practically forced to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.510
 dealing with professor

 nakayama one of the most incompetent genes 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.780
 of evil never existed with a weak one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460
 far from hidden for jack and the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.660
 beautiful 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.550
 normally a simple premise yes 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.140
 translates into a series of hilarious gags e 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.270
 and freak stories in borderlands 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 2 but the main issue of bill 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.170
 gates man misses that spark seen 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.720
 in captains carla tender pirate buti e 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.740
 mister tod's campaign of carnage 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.149
 you will face a short series of missions 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.220
 which will lead you to face the boss 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.509
 final without too many turns and in the new ones 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.789
 characters in the quality of the dialogues 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.860
 they will be particularly unforgettable 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.570
 there is some peak but the campaign of 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.550
 this dlc is unfortunately not his point 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:19.550
 of strength is the word given 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.620
 probably the qualitative drop is 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.390
 linked to the fact that the developers did 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.010
 this time they wanted to concentrate on 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.930
 big threats more dangerous opponents 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.030
 and multifaceted compared to bland 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.220
 variations of the basic bandits used in 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.720
 past and inclusion place populated by 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.209
 savages apparently similar to the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.590
 psycho but more agile fast and capable of 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.900
 partially defend oneself from blows 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 critics thanks a shield the real news 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.370
 it is represented by witch witch doctors 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.870
 extremely irritating doctor since in 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.370
 able not only to use powers 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 magical of various types but also of 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.670
 regenerate other enemies or to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.040
 transform them without warning into hard and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.660
 super tough these new opponents yes 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.790
 then join large exhibit elementals 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.590
 flying giant armored scorpions i 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.050
 huge spiders that remember a lot 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.430
 stryder of half life the 9 routine of the ia 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.170
 enemy and the power of the witch doctor 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.580
 make a dlc even big game 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.650
 clearly designed for players 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.530
 experts even if the goal was 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.000
 centered only partially of challenge will be 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.860
 in fact always rather light for 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.780
 those hunters of the crypt already max 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.640
 and armed with legendary weapons while 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.170
 could be frustrating for users 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.420
 novice or not equipped 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.920
 oak are unbalanced that came 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.299
 here from the system that from the choices of the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.950
 development team but committed the 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.420
 major difficulties in true mode 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.420
 Hunter there would not be sorry 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.250
 so easily 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.550
 fortunately it will be really discouraging 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.560
 there is no lack of gifts for hunters 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.180
 tougher including a couple of new bosses 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.040
 to be faced in a really tough group 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 moreover they require a lot of ri 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.240
 to be aesthetically recalled 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.770
 big relaxation damper and boasts a certain 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.720
 charisma the gross differs considerably 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.490
 from the other landscapes of pandora e 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.040
 strikes with its particular nexus of 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.930
 swamp alien jungle and new maps are 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.430
 very extensive and the developers have them 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.110
 filled with side quests for 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.090
 to dampen the brevity of the adventure 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.860
 so the best way to navigate it on 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.300
 new vehicle introduced a kind of 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.040
 mixed between a catamaran hovercraft 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.020
 that moves functionally 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.910
 the movable sand of paris buti is identical 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.430
 but boasts a lower firepower 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.989
 the size of the locations can render 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.820
 navigation to some this 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.380
 quite tedious but between that it has rai 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.880
 the elevated areas you succeed 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.800
 however, to move fairly well 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.810
 dubbing is always of a high standard 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.490
 also the Italian despite the exchanges 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.320
 of jokes are not very numerous 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.660
 these like can turn out rather 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.310
 lonely and given my right hand to 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.870
 I can't go wrong with metal 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.870
 would do most of the other vessels 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.940
 from the barracks precisely kolkata the last 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.440
 downloadable content baked by 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.540
 gearbox manages to increase 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.790
 the average difficulty of borderlands 2 is 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.139
 to offer new dangerous opponents but 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.910
 did not reach the levels were gods 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.080
 previous dlc in the quality of the can 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.030
 be in the fun 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.470
 remains a good of more than the same 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.760
 quality that will still be appreciated 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.410
 by game lovers 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.790
 yet we expected a little more 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.680
 from the concluding piece of the first 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.970
 day of extra content created by 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.970
 talented last American 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:24.839
 hay group if I did it
