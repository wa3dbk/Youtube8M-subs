00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
know cowboy tried to imitate me and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.730

while<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> was<00:03:51.030> inside<00:03:51.450> him<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.900> realized<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.620> was

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
while I was inside him I realized I was

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.220 
while I was inside him I realized I was
bad<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.460> I'm<00:03:53.700> glad<00:03:54.150> Sasuke<00:03:54.720> didn't<00:03:54.990> try<00:03:55.170> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
bad and so I'm glad Sasuke didn't try to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.780 
bad and so I'm glad Sasuke didn't try to
imitate<00:03:55.590> me<00:03:55.800> exactly<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.370> I'm<00:03:56.490> going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.700> just

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
imitate me exactly so I'm going to just

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.240 
imitate me exactly so I'm going to just
go<00:03:57.000> along<00:03:57.360> with<00:03:57.570> whatever<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.770> guess<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.100> can

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
go along with whatever and I guess I can

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.590 
go along with whatever and I guess I can
believe<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.640> because<00:03:59.820> he's<00:04:00.180> always<00:04:00.300> had<00:04:00.570> a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
believe that because he's always had a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.240 
believe that because he's always had a
thing<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:00.870> Sasuke<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.620> guess<00:04:01.830> he's<00:04:01.860> wants

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
thing for Sasuke so I guess he's wants

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.190 
thing for Sasuke so I guess he's wants
to<00:04:02.340> impress<00:04:02.550> him<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.150> in<00:04:03.360> summation<00:04:03.570> it's

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
to impress him so in summation it's

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.870 
to impress him so in summation it's
really<00:04:04.590> really<00:04:05.070> great<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.640> they're<00:04:05.760> going

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
really really great that they're going

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.240 
really really great that they're going
to<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.090> battlefield<00:04:06.450> although<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.980> makes

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
to the battlefield although that makes

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.550 
to the battlefield although that makes
showing<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.940> fight<00:04:09.210> in<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.510> past<00:04:09.750> even<00:04:10.050> more

showing that fight in the past even more

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.500 
showing that fight in the past even more
pointless<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.460> one<00:04:11.610> between<00:04:11.820> Hachi<00:04:12.060> Rama<00:04:12.360> in

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
pointless the one between Hachi Rama in

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.700 
pointless the one between Hachi Rama in

redeeming himself now so let's do that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.469 
redeeming himself now so let's do that
it<00:04:46.919> didn't<00:04:47.190> feel<00:04:47.340> like<00:04:47.400> any<00:04:47.699> sort<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.090> natural

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
it didn't feel like any sort of natural

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.390 
it didn't feel like any sort of natural
progression<00:04:48.660> maybe<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.680> did<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.979> some<00:04:50.130> people

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
progression maybe it did to some people

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.460 
progression maybe it did to some people
maybe<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.759> liked<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.360> me<00:04:51.509> it<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:52.169> didn't

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
maybe you liked it to me it just didn't

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.900 
maybe you liked it to me it just didn't
maybe<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.740> just<00:04:52.770> because<00:04:52.919> I<00:04:53.099> absolutely

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
maybe it's just because I absolutely

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.110 
maybe it's just because I absolutely
cannot<00:04:54.210> stand<00:04:54.360> Sasuke<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:56.060> didn't<00:04:57.060> think

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
cannot stand Sasuke but I didn't think

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.270 
cannot stand Sasuke but I didn't think
that's<00:04:57.509> what<00:04:57.870> he<00:04:57.960> would<00:04:58.110> do<00:04:58.319> so<00:04:58.710> if<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.979> have

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
that's what he would do so if you have

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.600 
that's what he would do so if you have
an<00:04:59.550> in-depth<00:05:00.120> look<00:05:00.419> into<00:05:01.409> Sasuke's<00:05:02.340> inner

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
to the battlefield I assume next week

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.850 
to the battlefield I assume next week
we'll<00:05:15.120> be<00:05:15.240> cutting<00:05:15.419> back<00:05:15.690> there<00:05:16.319> may<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.620> at

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.510 
the end of the chapter they'll show up
or<00:05:18.630> something<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.199> don't<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:19.889> we'll<00:05:20.310> have<00:05:20.430> to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
or something I don't know we'll have to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.249 
or something I don't know we'll have to
wait<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.699> see<00:05:20.819> but<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.360> chapter<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:22.080> know

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
wait and see but this chapter you know

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.200 
wait and see but this chapter you know
it's<00:05:22.530> cool<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:23.220> said<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.460> up<00:05:23.759> and<00:05:24.000> we

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
it's cool that it said that up and we

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.700 
it's cool that it said that up and we
knew<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.479> had<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.659> happen<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:25.169> knew<00:05:25.319> Sasuke

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
knew it had to happen we knew Sasuke

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.749 
knew it had to happen we knew Sasuke
wasn't<00:05:26.009> going<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.190> destroy<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.610> village

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
wasn't going to destroy the village

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.370 
wasn't going to destroy the village
seems<00:05:27.300> like<00:05:27.449> everything<00:05:27.810> that's<00:05:27.960> happening

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
seems like everything that's happening

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.890 
seems like everything that's happening
is<00:05:28.560> not<00:05:29.009> actually<00:05:29.190> happening<00:05:29.849> because<00:05:30.300> it's<00:05:30.810> a

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
is not actually happening because it's a

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.540 
is not actually happening because it's a
natural<00:05:31.080> progression<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:31.889> story<00:05:32.130> it

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
natural progression of the story it

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.700 
natural progression of the story it
seems<00:05:32.789> like<00:05:32.849> it's<00:05:33.030> happening<00:05:33.180> because<00:05:33.840> it<00:05:34.409> has

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
seems like it's happening because it has

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.649 
seems like it's happening because it has
to<00:05:34.919> happen<00:05:35.099> so<00:05:35.580> let's<00:05:35.789> just<00:05:36.030> have<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.210> happen

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
to happen so let's just have it happen

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.689 
to happen so let's just have it happen
just<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:36.930> get<00:05:37.050> it<00:05:37.169> out<00:05:37.229> of<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:37.440> way<00:05:37.590> but<00:05:38.460> that's

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
just to get it out of the way but that's

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.939 
just to get it out of the way but that's
just<00:05:38.880> my<00:05:39.120> thoughts<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:39.960> let<00:05:40.380> me<00:05:40.530> know<00:05:40.650> what<00:05:40.680> you
