00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
story I think just makes these like

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.530 
story I think just makes these like
unbelievably<00:03:17.260> pretentious<00:03:18.160> claims<00:03:18.639> about

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
unbelievably pretentious claims about

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.319 
unbelievably pretentious claims about
comic<00:03:19.989> books<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.889> he<00:03:21.760> thinks<00:03:22.090> because<00:03:22.980> he<00:03:24.329> you

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
comic books and he thinks because he you

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.300 
comic books and he thinks because he you
know<00:03:25.510> made<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.349> conch<00:03:26.709> which<00:03:26.859> I've<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.099> read

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
know made a conch which I've not read

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.460 
know made a conch which I've not read
zot<00:03:27.669> I'll<00:03:28.329> be<00:03:28.569> honest<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.870> haven't<00:03:29.109> read<00:03:29.200> zot

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
zot I'll be honest I haven't read zot

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.800 
zot I'll be honest I haven't read zot
but<00:03:30.010> he<00:03:30.099> made<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:31.000> he<00:03:31.090> made<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.329> comic<00:03:31.569> book<00:03:31.690> and

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
but he made but he made a comic book and

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
but he made but he made a comic book and
I<00:03:31.870> guess<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.380> makes<00:03:32.680> him<00:03:32.970> capable<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.329> being

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
I guess that makes him capable of being

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.809 
I guess that makes him capable of being
what<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.450> all-knower<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.109> comics<00:03:38.819> he

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
what the the all-knower of comics he

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.610 
what the the all-knower of comics he
also<00:03:39.940> seems<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.419> forget<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.019> there<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.440> a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
also seems to forget that there is a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.129 
also seems to forget that there is a
writer<00:03:41.859> in<00:03:42.040> comics<00:03:42.430> like<00:03:42.959> sometimes<00:03:43.959> he

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
writer in comics like sometimes he

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.610 
writer in comics like sometimes he
mentions<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.709> writer<00:03:44.889> but<00:03:45.700> again<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.870> guess

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
mentions the writer but again I guess

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.229 
mentions the writer but again I guess
because<00:03:48.010> he's<00:03:48.220> an<00:03:48.370> artist<00:03:48.700> he<00:03:48.849> thinks<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
because he's an artist he thinks the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.270 
because he's an artist he thinks the
only<00:03:49.419> thing<00:03:49.900> that's<00:03:50.109> important<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.739> comics<00:03:51.130> is

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
only thing that's important in comics is

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.580 
only thing that's important in comics is
the<00:03:51.430> art<00:03:51.609> he's<00:03:52.359> constantly<00:03:53.019> talking<00:03:53.319> about

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
the art he's constantly talking about

Batman<00:05:25.890> I<00:05:26.100> mean<00:05:26.280> that's<00:05:26.460> probably<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.820> best

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090

go back and read this story just because

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.500 
go back and read this story just because
of<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.250> art<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.550> mean<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.730> like<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.090> art<00:05:33.240> but<00:05:33.419> I'm

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
not gonna go back and look at the arts

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.750

not as for me the arts not as important

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.820 
not as for me the arts not as important
as<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.970> writing<00:05:39.830> however<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:41.280> think<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:43.650> art

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
as the writing however I think the art

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.000 
as the writing however I think the art
and<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.010> writing<00:05:44.310> should<00:05:44.640> be<00:05:44.790> an<00:05:44.940> equal<00:05:45.180> plane

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
and the writing should be an equal plane

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.560 
and the writing should be an equal plane

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.180 
that there's any kind of equal plane
it's<00:05:51.450> like<00:05:51.660> it's<00:05:51.900> like<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.200> know<00:05:52.320> he<00:05:52.800> puts<00:05:53.040> the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
really thinking that this was gonna be a

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.659 
really thinking that this was gonna be a
good<00:06:11.700> in-depth<00:06:12.030> look<00:06:12.180> at<00:06:12.240> comics<00:06:12.630> it's<00:06:13.140> not<00:06:13.669> at

all he reads into things if there's
nothing<00:06:17.910> to<00:06:18.120> read<00:06:18.330> into<00:06:18.510> like<00:06:19.320> for<00:06:19.500> example

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560

you can see here on the picture and then

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.380 
you can see here on the picture and then
later<00:06:25.830> he<00:06:26.100> says<00:06:26.370> they<00:06:26.760> didn't<00:06:27.060> draw<00:06:27.210> himself

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390

how he married Joe himself accurately

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.580 
how he married Joe himself accurately
because<00:06:30.870> he<00:06:31.050> thought<00:06:31.169> it<00:06:31.290> would<00:06:31.350> distract<00:06:32.090> why

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
because he thought it would distract why

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.030 
because he thought it would distract why
how<00:06:35.300> how<00:06:36.300> would<00:06:36.599> that<00:06:36.780> distract

how how would that distract

how how would that distract
I<00:06:39.530> really<00:06:40.530> don't<00:06:40.680> understand<00:06:41.280> this<00:06:41.400> I<00:06:41.790> mean<00:06:42.300> I

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
I really don't understand this I mean I

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.240 
I really don't understand this I mean I
know<00:06:42.420> he<00:06:42.600> said<00:06:42.870> that<00:06:43.080> you<00:06:43.590> know<00:06:43.710> people<00:06:43.920> find

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
know he said that you know people find

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.920 
know he said that you know people find
them<00:06:44.370> easier<00:06:44.970> to<00:06:45.000> relate<00:06:45.570> to<00:06:46.370> you<00:06:47.370> know<00:06:47.490> a

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
them easier to relate to you know a

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.000 
them easier to relate to you know a
simplistic<00:06:48.930> figure<00:06:49.320> than<00:06:49.500> the<00:06:49.590> realistic

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
simplistic figure than the realistic

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.340 
simplistic figure than the realistic
figure<00:06:50.280> I<00:06:50.460> don't<00:06:51.180> think<00:06:51.420> that's<00:06:51.630> true<00:06:51.900> at<00:06:51.990> all

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
figure I don't think that's true at all
