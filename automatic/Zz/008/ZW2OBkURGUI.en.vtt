and<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:41.380> just<00:02:41.590> literally<00:02:41.890> about<00:02:42.130> timing<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and it's just literally about timing the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
and it's just literally about timing the
settings<00:02:43.120> I've<00:02:43.269> gone<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.630> camera<00:02:44.250> speed<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
settings I've gone the camera speed of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.880 
settings I've gone the camera speed of
200<00:02:46.230> f<00:02:47.230> 6.3<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.600> 200<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.500> that's<00:02:50.680> in

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
200 f 6.3 is I of 200 and that's in

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.820 
200 f 6.3 is I of 200 and that's in
manual<00:02:51.280> mode<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.170> flash<00:02:53.410> going<00:02:53.680> to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
manual mode and the the flash going to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.960 
manual mode and the the flash going to
set<00:02:54.069> up<00:02:55.860> 164<00:02:56.860> because<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
set up 164 because it's that it's the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.570 
set up 164 because it's that it's the
flash<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.239> catches<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.080> image<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.549> I

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
flash that catches the image so I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.699 
flash that catches the image so I
speeding<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.390> flash<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.290> all<00:03:02.380> about<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
speeding the flash so it's all about the

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.990 
speeding the flash so it's all about the
time<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.130> here<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.569> drop<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.110> press<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:06.000> then
