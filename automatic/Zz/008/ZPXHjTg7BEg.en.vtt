real quick so I kind of wanted to make a
quick<00:00:10.380> video<00:00:10.530> because<00:00:10.920> I'm<00:00:11.040> pretty<00:00:11.250> proud<00:00:11.460> of

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519

it
also<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.070> see<00:00:14.190> my<00:00:15.059> house<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.509> super

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
also as you can see my house is super

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.359 
also as you can see my house is super
empty<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.350> I'm<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> move<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.220> this

empty because I'm about to move so this

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.640 
empty because I'm about to move so this
will<00:00:17.520> probably<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.720> last<00:00:18.750> video<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.500> do

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
will probably be the last video I can do

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.130 
will probably be the last video I can do
for<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.250> while<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
for a little while but this is a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.040 
for a little while but this is a
Dreamcast<00:00:25.140> -<00:00:26.010> arcade<00:00:26.760> converter<00:00:27.359> box<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
Dreamcast - arcade converter box that I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.919 
Dreamcast - arcade converter box that I
built<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> sound<00:00:30.390> app<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.810> goes

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
built this is the sound app that goes

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.069 
built this is the sound app that goes
inside<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.750> cool<00:00:33.930> thing

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
inside there but this the cool thing

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.540 
inside there but this the cool thing
about<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> completely<00:00:35.250> plug<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
about this is is completely plug and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.190 
about this is is completely plug and
play<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.239> any<00:00:36.480> Dreamcast<00:00:37.550> all<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
play to any Dreamcast all you do is

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.940 
play to any Dreamcast all you do is
let's<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:41.239> plug<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.230> V<00:00:43.590> port

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
let's see here plug in this is a V port

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.779 
let's see here plug in this is a V port
like<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> regular<00:00:44.610> VGA<00:00:45.239> box<00:00:46.160> these<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> two

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
like a regular VGA box these are the two

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.360 
like a regular VGA box these are the two
controller<00:00:48.750> plugs<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> front<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
controller plugs that go on the front of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
controller plugs that go on the front of
the<00:00:50.430> Dreamcast<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.590> Gemma

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the Dreamcast there this is your Gemma

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.490 
the Dreamcast there this is your Gemma
connector<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.020> plug<00:00:58.289> into

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
connector that you would just plug into

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
connector that you would just plug into
your<00:00:58.649> Kade<00:00:58.920> cab<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> then<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
your Kade cab like this and then if you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720 
your Kade cab like this and then if you
want<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.600> six<00:01:00.840> buttons<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.520> kick

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
want all six buttons this is the kick

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
want all six buttons this is the kick
harness<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.210> plugs<00:01:03.359> into<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:04.080> existing

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
harness that plugs into your existing

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.980 
harness that plugs into your existing
kick<00:01:05.280> harness<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.979> one's<00:01:08.220> finished<00:01:08.990> this

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
kick harness this one's finished this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.990 
kick harness this one's finished this
one<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.040> working<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
one is one I'm working on right now to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.609 
one is one I'm working on right now to
kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.510> show<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.290> looks<00:01:13.470> like

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
kind of show you what it looks like

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.870 
kind of show you what it looks like
inside<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> basically<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> one's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
inside there so basically this one's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
inside there so basically this one's
missing<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.930> sound<00:01:22.229> app<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
missing this sound app is going to go in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.280 
missing this sound app is going to go in
here<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.909> also<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> put<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> VGA

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
here and then I also need to put the VGA

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.380 
here and then I also need to put the VGA
box<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.130> here's<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> basics<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.450 

basically<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.170> hack<00:01:31.799> Dreamcast

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
basically it's just to hack Dreamcast

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.399 
basically it's just to hack Dreamcast
pads<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:33.119> Jama<00:01:33.450> connector<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.229> hack<00:01:34.560> VGA<00:01:35.100> box

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
pads a Jama connector a hack VGA box

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.830 
pads a Jama connector a hack VGA box
some<00:01:37.409> capacitors<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:40.170> sound<00:01:40.470> amp<00:01:40.829> um

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
some capacitors there and a sound amp um

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
some capacitors there and a sound amp um
it's<00:01:42.840> pretty<00:01:43.110> simple<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:43.829> here's<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's pretty simple and then here's a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's pretty simple and then here's a
switch<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.590> VGA<00:01:46.590> mode<00:01:46.920> -<00:01:47.540> arcade<00:01:48.540> mode

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
switch for a VGA mode - arcade mode

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
switch for a VGA mode - arcade mode
there<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.290> it'll<00:01:49.500> still<00:01:49.710> function<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there because it'll still function as a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.660 
there because it'll still function as a
VGA<00:01:50.759> box<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> wire<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.280> home<00:01:53.280> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
VGA box if you wire it up to home so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.859 
VGA box if you wire it up to home so
let's<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.479> action<00:01:56.420> alright<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> got

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
let's see it in action alright so I got

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.499 
let's see it in action alright so I got
the<00:01:58.079> box<00:01:58.829> hooked<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> Dreamcast<00:02:00.210> here

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the box hooked up to the Dreamcast here

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
the box hooked up to the Dreamcast here
and<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> attached<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.130> burst<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.640> city

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and this is attached to the burst a city

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.070 
and this is attached to the burst a city
