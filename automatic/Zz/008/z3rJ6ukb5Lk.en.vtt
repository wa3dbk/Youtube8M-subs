00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
aren't going to be too great when we

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.390 
aren't going to be too great when we
look<00:00:06.629> at<00:00:06.750> them<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.109> nothing<00:00:07.500> breaks<00:00:07.770> 100<00:00:08.250> on

any<00:00:08.790> base<00:00:09.030> stat<00:00:09.300> total<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> closest<00:00:10.380> we

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
any base stat total so the closest we

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.220 
any base stat total so the closest we
have<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.710> 95<00:00:11.250> special<00:00:11.820> attack<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.240> 95<00:00:12.809> speed

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

around 70 on the rest of the stats means

around 70 on the rest of the stats means
we're<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.199> absurdly<00:00:25.830> tanky

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
we're not going to be absurdly tanky

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.290 
we're not going to be absurdly tanky
we're<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.760> gonna<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.029> too<00:00:27.210> many

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
we're not gonna have too many

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.089 
we're not gonna have too many
opportunities<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> set<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:28.170> but<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.890> still

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
opportunities to set up but we can still

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
opportunities to set up but we can still
make<00:00:29.250> za2<00:00:29.490> work

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
make za2 work

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.299 
make za2 work
however<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.929> psychic<00:00:31.349> flying<00:00:31.679> typing<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
however the psychic flying typing is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.670 
however the psychic flying typing is
making<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> even<00:00:33.180> harder<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.930> use<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
making it even harder to use not to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440 
making it even harder to use not to
because<00:00:34.980> everything<00:00:35.700> kind<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> stacks<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
because everything kind of stacks the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.700 
because everything kind of stacks the
weaknesses<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.290> don't<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.559> have

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
weaknesses you don't really have

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
weaknesses you don't really have
anything<00:00:38.040> taking<00:00:38.550> care<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> any<00:00:39.270> other

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
anything taking care of any other

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
anything taking care of any other
weakness<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> pretty<00:00:40.710> much<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
weakness so you pretty much have that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
weakness so you pretty much have that
ghost<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.550> dark<00:00:41.730> weakness<00:00:42.120> adding<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
ghost and dark weakness adding on to a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
ghost and dark weakness adding on to a
rock<00:00:43.379> electric<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.040> sweetness<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
rock electric and I sweetness but the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.190 
rock electric and I sweetness but the
only<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.450> being<00:00:45.690> taken<00:00:46.020> care<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
only thing really being taken care of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.250 
only thing really being taken care of
being<00:00:46.620> bug<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> that's<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.840> too<00:00:49.079> much

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
being bug and that's not really too much

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
being bug and that's not really too much
when<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> resistances<00:00:50.700> fighting

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
when we look at the resistances fighting

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
when we look at the resistances fighting

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
grass and psychic is okay and we do have

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799

fairly interesting with saw - it's

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
fairly interesting with saw - it's
incredibly<00:01:05.220> similar<00:01:05.489> test<00:01:06.180> beyond<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.630> a

it's<00:01:22.320> magic<00:01:22.619> bouncing<00:01:22.979> synchronized<00:01:23.400> za2<00:01:24.000> is

it's magic bouncing synchronized za2 is

it's magic bouncing synchronized za2 is
magic<00:01:25.049> bouncing<00:01:25.409> synchronized<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.750> that's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
magic bouncing synchronized so that's

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.030 
magic bouncing synchronized so that's
really<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> only<00:01:28.650> other<00:01:28.860> difference

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
really it the only other difference

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
really it the only other difference

going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> run<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.040> rest<00:01:32.310> set<00:01:32.490> on

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
going to run some kind of rest set on
saw<00:01:32.850> -<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.270> means<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> wake<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
saw - it means that you wake up on the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140 
saw - it means that you wake up on the
second<00:01:35.070> turn<00:01:35.189> instead<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> third<00:01:35.970> turn

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
second turn instead of the third turn

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
second turn instead of the third turn
after<00:01:36.390> using<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> only<00:01:37.049> keeps<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.710> turn

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
after using it so it only keeps one turn

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.679 
after using it so it only keeps one turn
off<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> rest<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> we're<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.150> too<00:01:39.329> tanky<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
off of rest and we're not too tanky to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
off of rest and we're not too tanky to
begin<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:41.070> set<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> I'm

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
begin with so the first set of I'm

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.190 
begin with so the first set of I'm
thinking<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.180> again<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:42.570> similar<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
thinking about is again very similar to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.660 
thinking about is again very similar to
SB<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> single<00:01:44.070> sets<00:01:44.340> are<00:01:44.490> pretty

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
SB on that the single sets are pretty

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.130 
SB on that the single sets are pretty
much<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.149> SP<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:45.600> sets<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
much going to be SP on sets with a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
much going to be SP on sets with a
little<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.399> tweaking<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.119> really

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
little bit of tweaking but not really

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
little bit of tweaking but not really
too<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.680> clay<00:01:49.950> light<00:01:50.430> screen

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
too much and it's like clay light screen

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
too much and it's like clay light screen
reflective<00:01:51.149> which<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.570> way<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> cleric

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
reflective which that way you can cleric

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
reflective which that way you can cleric
for<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.439> team<00:01:52.619> solve<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.399> form<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.700> sustain

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
for your team solve some form of sustain

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.550 
for your team solve some form of sustain
and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> do

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and then you can just kind of do

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.679 
and then you can just kind of do
whatever<00:01:55.799> right<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> example<00:01:57.420> um

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
whatever right here for the example um

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.780 
whatever right here for the example um
just<00:01:58.110> initial<00:01:58.619> set<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.100> thinking<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.520> can

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
just initial set I was thinking we can

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
just initial set I was thinking we can
run<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> calm<00:02:00.329> nature<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.290> go<00:02:01.439> even<00:02:01.829> split

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
run a calm nature and then go even split

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.800 
run a calm nature and then go even split
so<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.460> maxed<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> hit<00:02:03.509> points

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
so we have maxed out on the hit points

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
so we have maxed out on the hit points
and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.409> split<00:02:04.560> between<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.009> defense

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and then we split between the defense

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560 
and then we split between the defense
and<00:02:05.460> special<00:02:05.610> defense<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> where<00:02:06.240> we're

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and special defense that where we're

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.359 
and special defense that where we're
really<00:02:06.750> well-rounded<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:07.979> light<00:02:08.160> screen

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
really well-rounded we use light screen

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.619 
really well-rounded we use light screen
reflect<00:02:08.759> depending<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:09.209> our<00:02:09.239> opponent

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
reflect depending on what our opponent

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
reflect depending on what our opponent
is<00:02:09.720> using<00:02:10.140> against<00:02:10.500> us<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.280> thinking

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
is using against us and I was thinking

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220 
is using against us and I was thinking
lead<00:02:11.700> calm<00:02:11.940> nature<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:12.569> most<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.050> all

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
lead calm nature because most of all

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.750 
lead calm nature because most of all
weaknesses<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.519> on<00:02:14.610> that

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
weaknesses are going to be on that

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.309 
weaknesses are going to be on that
special<00:02:14.970> size<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.720> build<00:02:15.810> up<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.230> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
special size so we can build up a bit of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.470 
special size so we can build up a bit of
special<00:02:16.709> resistance<00:02:17.459> at<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> same<00:02:18.120> time<00:02:18.330> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
special resistance at the same time you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.640 
special resistance at the same time you
can<00:02:18.599> always<00:02:18.690> change<00:02:18.900> around<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.470> feel

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
can always change around you can feel

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.619 
can always change around you can feel
well<00:02:20.159> I<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.430> use<00:02:20.549> reflect<00:02:20.940> cover<00:02:21.239> up<00:02:21.390> against

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
well I can use reflect cover up against

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.390 
well I can use reflect cover up against
my<00:02:21.750> physical<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.379> don't<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.280> worry

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
my physical I don't really have to worry

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.949 
my physical I don't really have to worry
about<00:02:23.489> too<00:02:23.790> much<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> physical<00:02:24.540> side<00:02:24.720> and

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
about too much on the physical side and

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.180 
about too much on the physical side and
then<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.349> become<00:02:25.530> more<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.830> special

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
then you become more of a special

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.190 
then you become more of a special
defence<00:02:26.459> tank<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.510> try<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:27.690> work<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.110> out

defence tank and just try to work it out

defence tank and just try to work it out
from<00:02:28.409> there

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739

they're<00:03:03.569> receiving<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.049> wish<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.530> take

they're receiving a wish if they take

too much damage and then they might have

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.000 
too much damage and then they might have
one<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:06.930> two<00:03:07.079> terms<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.470> tailwind

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
one or two terms of tailwind

one or two terms of tailwind
Salt's<00:03:08.489> who<00:03:08.549> also<00:03:08.730> has<00:03:08.940> damage<00:03:09.450> from

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
Salt's who also has damage from

nightshade that Espeon doesn't
necessarily<00:03:11.819> have<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> that's<00:03:12.870> kind<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
necessarily have and that's kind of it

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.680 
necessarily have and that's kind of it
so<00:03:13.829> if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.519> want<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.819> look<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.060> any<00:03:15.269> other

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
so if you want to look at any other

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.240 
so if you want to look at any other
things<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.079> it<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.290> do<00:03:16.410> maybe<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.709> toxic

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
things that it can do maybe just toxic

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.650 
things that it can do maybe just toxic
that<00:03:17.669> way<00:03:17.790> at<00:03:17.880> least<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.239> at<00:03:18.329> least<00:03:18.450> throw

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
that way at least you can at least throw

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.330 
that way at least you can at least throw
some<00:03:18.840> status<00:03:19.290> down<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.590> your<00:03:19.709> opponent<00:03:20.069> before

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
some status down to your opponent before

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.330 
some status down to your opponent before
bouncing<00:03:21.060> around<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.450> team<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.260> that's<00:03:22.829> kind

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
bouncing around the team and that's kind

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.220 
bouncing around the team and that's kind
of<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:24.239> some<00:03:24.419> other<00:03:24.540> things<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.870> ought<00:03:25.079> to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
of it so some other things that ought to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.750 
of it so some other things that ought to
can<00:03:25.440> do<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.799> also<00:03:26.130> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.459> called<00:03:26.669> my

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
can do is also going to be called my

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.490 
can do is also going to be called my
baton<00:03:27.060> pass<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.109> just<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.410> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
baton pass and then you just have to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.710 
baton pass and then you just have to
decide<00:03:28.799> which<00:03:29.459> aspects<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.090> want<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.419> take<00:03:30.569> to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
decide which aspects you want to take to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.699 
decide which aspects you want to take to
it<00:03:30.840> they<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.079> be<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.200> little<00:03:31.380> more<00:03:31.590> defensive

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
it they can be a little more defensive

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.280 
it they can be a little more defensive
or<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.250> little<00:03:32.519> more<00:03:32.639> offensive<00:03:33.209> offensive<00:03:33.450> you

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
or a little more offensive offensive you

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.900 
or a little more offensive offensive you
can<00:03:34.470> run<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.709> store<00:03:34.950> power<00:03:35.160> gonna<00:03:35.760> get

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
can run that store power gonna get

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.220 
can run that store power gonna get
stabbed<00:03:36.299> from<00:03:36.480> store<00:03:36.720> power<00:03:36.930> you're<00:03:37.109> gonna

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
stabbed from store power you're gonna

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.140 
stabbed from store power you're gonna
have<00:03:37.380> sustain<00:03:37.799> from<00:03:38.040> your<00:03:38.190> roost<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.639> at

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
have sustain from your roost and at

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.309 
have sustain from your roost and at
least<00:03:39.299> roost<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.690> going<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.930> be<00:03:39.989> pretty<00:03:40.230> nice

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
least roost is going to be pretty nice

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.479 
least roost is going to be pretty nice
because<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.769> removes<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.130> flying-type

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
because it removes that flying-type

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.129 
because it removes that flying-type
weakness<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.359> if<00:03:42.419> you're<00:03:42.540> faster<00:03:42.870> than<00:03:42.989> your

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
weakness so if you're faster than your

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.240 
weakness so if you're faster than your
opponent<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.530> might<00:03:43.680> not<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.069> worry

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
opponent you might not have to worry

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.559 
opponent you might not have to worry
about<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.609> ice<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.970> might<00:03:45.120> not<00:03:45.329> have<00:03:45.450> to

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
about that ice you might not have to

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.270 
about that ice you might not have to
worry<00:03:46.019> about<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.290> rock<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.889> electric

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
worry about the rock and the electric

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.400 
worry about the rock and the electric
for<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.549> turn<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.940> it's<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.930> at<00:03:49.049> least<00:03:49.139> now

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
for that turn and it's just at least now

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.960 
for that turn and it's just at least now
you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.919> know<00:03:50.010> set<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.310> three<00:03:50.639> on<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
you can you know set up three on the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.729 
you can you know set up three on the
call<00:03:51.150> mine<00:03:51.359> go<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.109> huge<00:03:52.290> store<00:03:52.530> power

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
call mine go for the huge store power

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.890 
call mine go for the huge store power
and<00:03:53.069> hope<00:03:53.579> it's<00:03:53.760> enough<00:03:54.000> your<00:03:54.209> EVs<00:03:54.569> on<00:03:54.720> this

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.599 
and hope it's enough your EVs on this
set<00:03:55.109> are<00:03:55.349> going<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.859> be<00:03:55.950> more<00:03:56.160> defensive

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
set are going to be more defensive

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.369 
set are going to be more defensive
invested<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:57.480> at<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.720> same<00:03:57.870> time<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.200> do

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
some special offense so you can just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
called mind boost and then once you get

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.650 
called mind boost and then once you get
a<00:04:08.099> couple<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.400> call<00:04:08.609> 9<00:04:08.790> boosts<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.329> decide

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
a couple of call 9 boosts you can decide

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.390 
a couple of call 9 boosts you can decide
well<00:04:09.900> now<00:04:10.079> it's<00:04:10.230> time<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.410> get<00:04:10.560> my<00:04:10.680> ally<00:04:11.010> going

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
well now it's time to get my ally going

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.559 
well now it's time to get my ally going
if<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.669> can<00:04:11.760> kind<00:04:11.879> of<00:04:12.000> put<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.269> into<00:04:12.480> a

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
if you can kind of put this into a

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.539 
if you can kind of put this into a
sweeper<00:04:13.379> Pokemon<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.949> way<00:04:14.099> just<00:04:14.340> really

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
sweeper Pokemon that way just really

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.189 
sweeper Pokemon that way just really
speeds<00:04:14.819> them<00:04:15.000> up<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.329> then<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:15.959> try<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
speeds them up and then you just try to

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.779 
speeds them up and then you just try to
look<00:04:16.320> for<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> sweeps<00:04:16.829> from<00:04:16.979> there<00:04:17.220> or<00:04:17.400> you

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
look for the sweeps from there or you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.339 
look for the sweeps from there or you
can<00:04:17.910> try<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.090> sweep<00:04:18.389> more<00:04:18.599> for<00:04:18.780> yourself<00:04:19.139> that

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
can try to sweep more for yourself that

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.279 
can try to sweep more for yourself that
instead<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.680> roost<00:04:19.949> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.310> run<00:04:20.489> Giga<00:04:20.940> Drain

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
instead of roost you can run Giga Drain

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.020 
instead of roost you can run Giga Drain
saw<00:04:22.289> two<00:04:22.469> gets<00:04:22.710> Giga<00:04:23.010> Drain<00:04:23.190> as<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> move<00:04:23.729> tutor

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
saw two gets Giga Drain as a move tutor

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.840 
saw two gets Giga Drain as a move tutor
so<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.990> can<00:04:25.260> kinda

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
so you can kinda

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.370 
so you can kinda
run<00:04:26.060> eight<00:04:26.210> on<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.510> those<00:04:26.810> aspects<00:04:27.230> if

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
run eight on that those aspects if

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.480 
run eight on that those aspects if
you're<00:04:27.650> not<00:04:27.800> worried<00:04:28.040> about<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.310> time

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
you're not worried about the time

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.700 
you're not worried about the time
passing<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.270> can<00:04:29.480> put<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.990> roost<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.560> then

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
passing you can put in roost and then

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.560 
passing you can put in roost and then
now<00:04:30.920> sot2<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.520> just<00:04:31.730> a<00:04:31.820> set<00:04:32.000> up<00:04:32.090> sweeper<00:04:32.420> that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
now sot2 is just a set up sweeper that

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.060 
now sot2 is just a set up sweeper that
if<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.780> do<00:04:32.990> have<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.170> couple<00:04:33.290> of<00:04:33.470> combines<00:04:33.890> you

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
if you do have a couple of combines you

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.530 
if you do have a couple of combines you
becoming<00:04:34.340> kind<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.730> frustrating<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.360> knock

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
becoming kind of frustrating to knock

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.870 
becoming kind of frustrating to knock
out<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:36.170> have<00:04:36.260> Giga<00:04:36.470> Drain<00:04:36.650> Roo<00:04:37.010> sustain<00:04:37.490> so

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
out you have Giga Drain Roo sustain so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.250 
out you have Giga Drain Roo sustain so
you're<00:04:38.000> dealing<00:04:38.090> damage<00:04:38.420> and<00:04:38.690> doing<00:04:39.110> that

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
you're dealing damage and doing that

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.930 
you're dealing damage and doing that
storm<00:04:39.830> power<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.190> going<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.490> cover<00:04:40.640> it<00:04:40.820> out

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
storm power is going to cover it out

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.900 
storm power is going to cover it out
really<00:04:41.210> well<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:41.720> that's<00:04:42.350> kind<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:43.250> it

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
really well and that's kind of it

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.400 
really well and that's kind of it
other<00:04:44.030> things<00:04:44.420> on<00:04:44.690> again<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.170> can<00:04:45.290> have

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
other things on again you can have

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.900 
other things on again you can have
tailwind<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.010> if<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:46.400> want<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.610> be<00:04:46.700> more

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
tailwind so if you want to be more

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.240 
tailwind so if you want to be more
defensive<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.420> can<00:04:47.600> go<00:04:47.750> call<00:04:48.590> mine<00:04:48.830> baton

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
defensive you can go call mine baton

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.180 
defensive you can go call mine baton
pass<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:50.350> it's<00:04:51.350> kind<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.710> if<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:51.890> want

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
pass and then it's kind of if you want

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.560 
pass and then it's kind of if you want
to<00:04:52.280> make<00:04:52.400> an<00:04:52.520> offensive<00:04:52.820> move<00:04:53.090> or<00:04:53.270> not<00:04:53.300> you

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
to make an offensive move or not you

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.120 
to make an offensive move or not you
know<00:04:53.660> we<00:04:53.840> have<00:04:53.930> confused<00:04:54.350> Rae<00:04:54.560> once<00:04:54.830> again

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
know we have confused Rae once again

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.770 
know we have confused Rae once again
that<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.670> can<00:04:55.820> set<00:04:55.970> up<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.150> confuse<00:04:56.540> rate

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that you can set up that confuse rate

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.450 
that you can set up that confuse rate
and<00:04:56.930> then<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.110> can<00:04:57.230> bring<00:04:57.350> in<00:04:57.530> tailwind<00:04:57.980> so

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
and then you can bring in tailwind so

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.650 
and then you can bring in tailwind so
let's<00:04:58.580> just<00:04:58.730> go<00:04:58.820> let<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.060> bounce<00:04:59.330> out<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
let's just go let you bounce out the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.540 
let's just go let you bounce out the
tailwind<00:05:00.080> while<00:05:00.470> also<00:05:00.710> having<00:05:00.830> calm<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:01.520> I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
tailwind while also having calm on so I

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.010 
tailwind while also having calm on so I
poke<00:05:01.760> one<00:05:01.940> that's<00:05:02.150> going<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.420> be<00:05:02.510> coming<00:05:02.900> in

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
poke one that's going to be coming in

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.600 
poke one that's going to be coming in
might<00:05:03.560> have<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> little<00:05:04.010> extra<00:05:04.160> turn<00:05:04.370> of<00:05:04.520> speed

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
might have a little extra turn of speed

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.640 
might have a little extra turn of speed
might<00:05:05.210> also<00:05:05.390> get<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.840> poet<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.230> hit<00:05:06.350> itself

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
might also get that poet to hit itself

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.470 
might also get that poet to hit itself
and<00:05:06.860> now<00:05:06.980> can<00:05:07.220> continue<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.150> sweep<00:05:08.270> from

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
and now can continue the sweep from

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.360 
and now can continue the sweep from
there<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:09.200> after<00:05:09.500> looking<00:05:09.740> at<00:05:09.890> those<00:05:10.040> single

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
there so after looking at those single

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.830 
there so after looking at those single
sets<00:05:10.580> yeah<00:05:10.790> it's<00:05:10.970> just<00:05:11.120> kind<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.480> slightly

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
sets yeah it's just kind of a slightly

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.330 
sets yeah it's just kind of a slightly
inferior<00:05:12.230> s<00:05:12.560> beyond<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.980> doesn't<00:05:13.220> really

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
inferior s beyond that doesn't really

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.770 
inferior s beyond that doesn't really
bring<00:05:13.520> too<00:05:13.700> much<00:05:13.820> else<00:05:14.030> to<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.210> table<00:05:14.300> which

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
bring too much else to the table which

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.540 
bring too much else to the table which
means<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.110> Zhou<00:05:15.260> 2<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.620> probably<00:05:15.860> going<00:05:16.340> to

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
means that Zhou 2 is probably going to

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.550 
means that Zhou 2 is probably going to
want<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:16.910> run<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.360> dull<00:05:17.630> bowels<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.170> that's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
want to run in dull bowels and that's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.960 
want to run in dull bowels and that's
where<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.800> does<00:05:18.950> have<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.130> couple<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.730> things

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
where it does have a couple of things

a good good amount speed boost for a

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.080 
a good good amount speed boost for a
couple<00:05:30.650> terms<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:31.280> great<00:05:31.550> thing<00:05:31.700> about<00:05:31.760> Zhou

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
couple terms the great thing about Zhou

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.120 
couple terms the great thing about Zhou
2<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.480> that<00:05:32.870> with<00:05:33.140> that<00:05:33.290> magic<00:05:33.680> bounce<00:05:33.860> it's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
2 is that with that magic bounce it's

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.950 
2 is that with that magic bounce it's
not<00:05:34.520> gonna<00:05:34.670> be<00:05:34.760> able<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:34.970> get<00:05:35.060> taunted<00:05:35.450> so<00:05:35.690> the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
not gonna be able to get taunted so the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.330 
not gonna be able to get taunted so the
only<00:05:36.230> way<00:05:36.320> of<00:05:36.440> really<00:05:36.470> knocking<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.070> out<00:05:37.160> is

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
only way of really knocking it out is

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.250 
only way of really knocking it out is
blowing<00:05:37.670> it<00:05:37.790> up<00:05:37.880> immediately<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:38.630> with<00:05:39.230> a

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
blowing it up immediately and with a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.080 
blowing it up immediately and with a
full<00:05:39.560> defensive<00:05:40.010> investment<00:05:40.460> that's<00:05:40.850> going

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
full defensive investment that's going

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.370 
full defensive investment that's going
to<00:05:41.150> be<00:05:41.210> kind<00:05:41.420> of<00:05:41.480> tricky<00:05:41.810> especially<00:05:41.870> if<00:05:42.320> you

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
to be kind of tricky especially if you

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.660 
to be kind of tricky especially if you
have<00:05:42.470> a<00:05:42.530> very<00:05:42.740> threatening<00:05:43.160> Pokemon

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
have a very threatening Pokemon

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.400 
have a very threatening Pokemon
potentially<00:05:44.390> using<00:05:44.510> protect<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.140> absorb

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
potentially using protect to absorb

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.110 
potentially using protect to absorb
another<00:05:45.620> hit<00:05:45.920> so<00:05:46.520> that's<00:05:46.760> going<00:05:46.940> to<00:05:47.000> be<00:05:47.090> a

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
another hit so that's going to be a

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.400 
another hit so that's going to be a
tailwind<00:05:47.540> on<00:05:47.600> your<00:05:47.750> side<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.170> then<00:05:48.290> the

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
tailwind on your side and then the

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.080 
tailwind on your side and then the
simple<00:05:48.740> beam<00:05:48.920> cymbal<00:05:49.460> beam<00:05:49.580> makes<00:05:49.790> it<00:05:49.970> to

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
simple beam cymbal beam makes it to

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.820 
simple beam cymbal beam makes it to
where<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.330> allies<00:05:50.720> ability<00:05:51.140> becomes<00:05:51.410> simple

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
where the allies ability becomes simple

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.260 
where the allies ability becomes simple
so<00:05:52.190> that<00:05:52.220> means<00:05:52.490> all<00:05:52.670> you<00:05:52.700> have<00:05:52.850> to<00:05:52.940> do<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.120> have

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
so that means all you have to do is have

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.610 
so that means all you have to do is have
them<00:05:53.450> set<00:05:53.630> up<00:05:53.660> if<00:05:53.870> they're<00:05:53.990> setting<00:05:54.230> up<00:05:54.320> Swords

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
them set up if they're setting up Swords

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.500 
them set up if they're setting up Swords
Dance<00:05:54.710> dragon<00:05:55.400> dance<00:05:55.580> something<00:05:56.090> like<00:05:56.330> that

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
Dance dragon dance something like that

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.670 
Dance dragon dance something like that
they're<00:05:56.690> going<00:05:56.840> to<00:05:56.930> become<00:05:57.110> really<00:05:57.350> fast

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
they're going to become really fast

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.740 
they're going to become really fast
really<00:05:58.040> offensive<00:05:58.490> really<00:05:58.970> quick<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.360> that's

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
really offensive really quick and that's

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.880 
really offensive really quick and that's
where<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.050> can<00:06:00.170> just<00:06:00.350> support<00:06:00.650> them<00:06:00.770> with

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
where you can just support them with

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.950 
where you can just support them with
confused<00:06:01.310> rain<00:06:01.490> thunder<00:06:01.820> wave<00:06:01.940> as<00:06:02.270> for<00:06:02.840> the

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
going to be very reliable to set it up

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.060 
going to be very reliable to set it up
and<00:06:26.750> then<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.170> could<00:06:27.320> maybe<00:06:27.470> run<00:06:27.710> it<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:27.920> bit

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
and then you could maybe run it a bit

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.070 
and then you could maybe run it a bit
more<00:06:28.250> offensive<00:06:28.910> those<00:06:29.210> ought<00:06:29.510> to<00:06:29.660> is<00:06:29.780> a<00:06:29.870> bit

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
more offensive those ought to is a bit

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.660 
more offensive those ought to is a bit
of<00:06:30.200> an<00:06:30.290> unsuspecting<00:06:30.950> trick<00:06:31.130> room<00:06:31.280> Pokemon

of an unsuspecting trick room Pokemon
they<00:06:31.880> can<00:06:32.120> use<00:06:32.240> simple<00:06:32.540> beam<00:06:32.660> after<00:06:32.930> that<00:06:33.230> and

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
they can use simple beam after that and

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.870 
they can use simple beam after that and
that's<00:06:33.650> kind<00:06:33.890> of<00:06:34.100> really<00:06:34.370> all<00:06:34.550> that<00:06:34.669> there<00:06:34.729> is
