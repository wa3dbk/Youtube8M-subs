being<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.920> young<00:00:14.099> hoodlum<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.549> was<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.089> thought

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
being the young hoodlum I was I thought

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.670 
being the young hoodlum I was I thought
that<00:00:15.599> if<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.780> evolved<00:00:16.170> him<00:00:16.289> he'd<00:00:16.470> lose<00:00:16.619> his

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that if I evolved him he'd lose his

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.560 
that if I evolved him he'd lose his
shiny<00:00:17.100> ass<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> wasn't<00:00:18.449> an<00:00:18.539> idiot

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
shiny ass but you know I wasn't an idiot

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599 
shiny ass but you know I wasn't an idiot
so<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.199> guess<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.680> saved<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.189> game<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:20.580> before

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so I guess I saved my game right before

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.700 
so I guess I saved my game right before
I<00:00:20.910> evolved<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.750> turns<00:00:22.230> out<00:00:22.380> he<00:00:22.470> didn't

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
I evolved it and turns out he didn't

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.170 
I evolved it and turns out he didn't
lose<00:00:22.800> his<00:00:22.949> shininess<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.730> happy<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
lose his shininess so I was happy and
