so<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> more<00:02:23.250> harpoon<00:02:23.849> guns<00:02:24.709> ammunition<00:02:25.709> can

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
so a more harpoon guns ammunition can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.369 
so a more harpoon guns ammunition can
amount<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.640> much<00:02:26.940> ammunition<00:02:27.860> aids<00:02:30.379> never

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
amount to much ammunition aids never

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.960 
amount to much ammunition aids never
leave<00:02:31.620> never<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.160> too<00:02:32.340> many<00:02:32.459> hoe<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> think

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
leave never have too many hoe I think

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:44.360 
leave never have too many hoe I think
about<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.480> hydrogenic<00:02:34.140> atom<00:02:40.819> purchase<00:02:43.220> 10<00:02:44.220> of

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
about the hydrogenic atom purchase 10 of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.039 
about the hydrogenic atom purchase 10 of
them<00:02:44.549> because<00:02:44.910> there's<00:02:45.120> an<00:02:45.239> amazingly<00:02:45.959> high

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
them because there's an amazingly high

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.240 
them because there's an amazingly high
turnover<00:02:46.500> rate<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.190> atoms<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:47.970> game<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
turnover rate of atoms in this game you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.789 
turnover rate of atoms in this game you
really<00:02:50.489> cannot<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.299> enough<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.410> tie

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
really cannot have enough you tie

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.400 
really cannot have enough you tie
amazingly<00:02:53.790> easily<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:55.200> quite

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
amazingly easily and it's quite

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.069 
amazingly easily and it's quite
depressing<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:56.130> be<00:02:56.160> honest<00:02:56.459> there<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.360> bloody

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
depressing to be honest there is bloody

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.490 
depressing to be honest there is bloody
difficulties<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:59.010> places<00:02:59.579> of<00:03:00.390> most<00:03:00.780> artistic

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
difficulties in places of most artistic

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.190 
difficulties in places of most artistic
so<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.459> am<00:03:02.730> simply<00:03:03.299> just<00:03:03.480> going<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.750> stocking

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
so I am simply just going to be stocking

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.380 
so I am simply just going to be stocking
up<00:03:04.349> during<00:03:04.739> everything<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
aliens that we bump into in this game

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.259 
aliens that we bump into in this game
hopefully<00:03:10.190> survive<00:03:11.190> for<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.549> while<00:03:11.610> at<00:03:12.090> any

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
game is that you've got to do that with

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.300 
game is that you've got to do that with

have our barracudas and they shoot down

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.069 
have our barracudas and they shoot down
aliens<00:03:43.889> southern<00:03:44.310> safe<00:03:44.609> we<00:03:45.299> managed<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.780> get

aliens southern safe we managed to get

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.839 
aliens southern safe we managed to get
them<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.319> time<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:47.160> one<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.430> problems

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
them in time and one of the problems

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.860 
them in time and one of the problems
where<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.420> come<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.609> sometimes<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:51.329> can't

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
where that come is sometimes you can't

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.500 
where that come is sometimes you can't
shoot<00:03:52.230> down<00:03:52.530> subsc<00:03:53.489> as<00:03:53.579> they<00:03:53.730> move<00:03:54.060> far<00:03:54.329> too

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
shoot down subsc as they move far too

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.449 
shoot down subsc as they move far too
fast<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:55.109> they're<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.319> out<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:55.859> shots<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
fast or they're just out of shots and

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.280 
fast or they're just out of shots and
you're<00:03:56.579> barracudas<00:03:57.180> run<00:03:57.389> out<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.569> fuel<00:03:57.870> far

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
you're barracudas run out of fuel far

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.270 
you're barracudas run out of fuel far
too<00:03:58.530> quickly

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
too quickly

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.690 
too quickly
so<00:04:00.090> I'm<00:04:01.020> anticipating<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:02.820> lot<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.290> well<00:04:04.700> things

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
so I'm anticipating a lot of well things

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.140 
so I'm anticipating a lot of well things
going<00:04:06.090> wrong<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:06.750> game<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.500> think<00:04:08.280> just

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
going wrong in this game I think just

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.920 
going wrong in this game I think just
build<00:04:10.190> didn't<00:04:11.190> realize<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.880> earth<00:04:12.270> moved<00:04:12.570> so

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
build didn't realize the earth moved so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.120 
build didn't realize the earth moved so
fast

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.240 

let's<00:04:17.130> put<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.750> South<00:04:18.959> Pacific

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
let's put that in the South Pacific

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.610 
let's put that in the South Pacific
I've<00:04:20.609> done<00:04:20.790> squadron<00:04:21.209> UK<00:04:21.510> cos<00:04:21.720> if<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.230> picked

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
I've done squadron UK cos if you picked

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.130 
I've done squadron UK cos if you picked
up<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.070> role-playing<00:04:23.970> reference<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.840> one

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
up the role-playing reference this one

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.410 
up the role-playing reference this one
that<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.500> water

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:37.430 

squadron<00:04:33.890> Oceano<00:04:35.450> our<00:04:36.450> garage<00:04:37.050> is<00:04:37.200> called

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
squadron Oceano our garage is called

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.110 
squadron Oceano our garage is called
Pacific<00:04:38.070> base<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.950> airlock<00:04:41.490> we<00:04:41.910> should

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
Pacific base and the airlock we should

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.860 
Pacific base and the airlock we should
be<00:04:43.040> there<00:04:44.040> why<00:04:44.340> not<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:45.419> we're<00:04:45.600> going<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.750> need

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
be there why not and we're going to need

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.290 
be there why not and we're going to need
to<00:04:45.990> build<00:04:46.140> some<00:04:46.320> facilities<00:04:46.919> so<00:04:47.430> let's<00:04:47.820> build

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
to build some facilities so let's build

00:04:48.300 --> 00:05:00.850 
to build some facilities so let's build
a<00:04:50.600> sub<00:04:51.600> pen

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.990 

why<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.920> race<00:05:04.400> well<00:05:05.400> looks<00:05:05.640> like<00:05:05.700> we're<00:05:05.880> going

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
why the race well looks like we're going

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.770 
why the race well looks like we're going
to<00:05:06.060> have<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.330> go<00:05:06.450> on<00:05:06.480> a<00:05:06.930> mission<00:05:07.820> so<00:05:11.660> what<00:05:12.660> we

can do is send our barracudas out a fair
or<00:05:15.510> distance<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.290> hopefully<00:05:17.040> bump<00:05:17.310> into

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
or distance and hopefully bump into

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.990 
or distance and hopefully bump into
something<00:05:18.120> interesting<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:20.130> risk<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.640> doing

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
something interesting the risk of doing

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.850 
something interesting the risk of doing
this<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.240> course<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:22.050> they<00:05:22.320> will<00:05:22.380> notice

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
this of course is that they will notice

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.590 
this of course is that they will notice
something<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.610> then<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.910> run<00:05:24.090> out<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.240> fuel

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
something and then the run out of fuel

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.730 
something and then the run out of fuel
as<00:05:25.260> they<00:05:25.710> often<00:05:26.010> bloody<00:05:26.550> do<00:05:27.200> so<00:05:28.200> really<00:05:28.470> we're

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
as they often bloody do so really we're

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.220 
as they often bloody do so really we're
going<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:28.920> hope<00:05:29.100> for<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.310> best<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:30.230> sometimes

what<00:05:32.010> happens<00:05:32.430> in<00:05:32.820> XCOM<00:05:33.390> is<00:05:33.510> unfortunately<00:05:34.170> it

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
what happens in XCOM is unfortunately it

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.740 
what happens in XCOM is unfortunately it
just<00:05:34.290> does<00:05:34.680> take<00:05:35.040> absolutely<00:05:35.850> ages<00:05:36.210> for<00:05:36.660> you

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
just does take absolutely ages for you

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.810 
just does take absolutely ages for you
to<00:05:36.870> bump<00:05:37.080> into<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:38.930> enemy<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:40.260> just

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
to bump into the enemy is just

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.450 
to bump into the enemy is just
unfortunate<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:42.390> way<00:05:42.630> so<00:05:43.620> like<00:05:43.890> I<00:05:43.920> hope<00:05:44.250> this

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
unfortunate that way so like I hope this

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.400 
unfortunate that way so like I hope this
would<00:05:44.820> be<00:05:44.940> too<00:05:45.150> boring<00:05:45.420> for<00:05:45.780> you<00:05:48.170> and<00:05:49.170> I<00:05:49.230> said

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
would be too boring for you and I said

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.690 
would be too boring for you and I said
the<00:05:49.470> try<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.890> Triton<00:05:50.250> doesn't<00:05:50.490> have<00:05:50.580> any

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
the try to the Triton doesn't have any

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.160 
the try to the Triton doesn't have any
weapons<00:05:50.910> on<00:05:51.330> his<00:05:51.570> buns<00:05:52.170> I'm<00:05:53.100> hoping<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:54.360> they

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
weapons on his buns I'm hoping that they

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.930 
weapons on his buns I'm hoping that they
might<00:05:55.200> spot<00:05:55.770> something<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.490> then<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.640> can<00:05:56.790> set

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
might spot something and then I can set

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.410 
might spot something and then I can set
a<00:05:56.970> barricade<00:05:57.480> around<00:05:59.510> see

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
a barricade around see

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.830 
a barricade around see
probably<00:06:03.200> not

that's how catch up to him stay within

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.580 
that's how catch up to him stay within
shot<00:06:29.560> it's<00:06:30.009> coming<00:06:30.219> towards<00:06:30.430> my<00:06:30.550> face<00:06:30.759> I<00:06:31.590> have

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
shot it's coming towards my face I have

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.379 
shot it's coming towards my face I have
heard<00:06:32.770> that<00:06:32.919> aliens<00:06:33.219> can<00:06:33.430> attack<00:06:33.699> your<00:06:33.879> bases

and now we're going to kill the bastard
from<00:06:38.800> our<00:06:39.039> battle<00:06:39.699> substations<00:06:40.449> now<00:06:41.199> I<00:06:41.650> think

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
from our battle substations now I think

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.279 
from our battle substations now I think
we'll<00:06:42.279> go<00:06:42.490> for<00:06:42.520> I<00:06:43.180> think<00:06:43.240> that's<00:06:43.599> cautious

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289 
we'll go for I think that's cautious

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.350 
we'll go for I think that's cautious
attack<00:06:44.680> because<00:06:45.430> we<00:06:45.669> don't<00:06:45.879> want<00:06:46.029> to<00:06:46.120> do<00:06:46.210> much

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360

attack because we don't want to do much
damage<00:06:46.419> to<00:06:47.110> what<00:06:47.319> guessing<00:06:47.800> is<00:06:48.659> Ibis<00:06:49.659> for<00:06:49.900> sure

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
damage to what guessing is Ibis for sure

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.390 
damage to what guessing is Ibis for sure
because<00:06:51.159> the<00:06:51.610> more<00:06:51.849> intact<00:06:52.689> it<00:06:52.930> is<00:06:53.110> the<00:06:53.949> more

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
because the more intact it is the more

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.649 
because the more intact it is the more
don't<00:06:54.939> go<00:06:55.449> down<00:06:55.990> it<00:06:56.169> as<00:06:56.289> buddy<00:06:57.449> the<00:06:58.449> more

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
don't go down it as buddy the more

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.719 
don't go down it as buddy the more
intact<00:06:59.289> it<00:06:59.469> is<00:06:59.589> the<00:06:59.800> more<00:06:59.979> equipment<00:07:00.310> we<00:07:00.550> can

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
intact it is the more equipment we can

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.800 
intact it is the more equipment we can
salvage<00:07:00.969> from<00:07:01.270> so<00:07:01.960> now<00:07:01.990> I<00:07:02.169> can<00:07:02.469> send<00:07:02.740> my<00:07:02.889> Triton
