00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
BYU's offensive game plan I really think

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
BYU's offensive game plan I really think
that<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> big<00:01:09.720> loss<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.260> BYU<00:01:11.100> he

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that this is a big loss for BYU he

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.070 
that this is a big loss for BYU he
improved<00:01:11.729> their<00:01:11.880> sack<00:01:12.210> total<00:01:12.630> over<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
improved their sack total over the

course of the three years he was here to
where<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.580> finished<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.390> 14th<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
where they finished I think 14th in the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.950 
where they finished I think 14th in the
country<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> year<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.890> sacks<00:01:17.400> allowed<00:01:17.960> he's

he they like to make fun up to
occasionally<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.189> he's<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> good<00:01:26.549> sense

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
occasionally but he's got a good sense

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
occasionally but he's got a good sense
of<00:01:26.820> humor<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.540> us<00:01:27.720> he's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> great

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of humor and for us he's a great

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
of humor and for us he's a great
interview<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.400> we're<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> miss<00:01:29.880> him

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
interview and so we're going to miss him
too<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.320> talked<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
too but I think you talked about the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
too but I think you talked about the
reasons<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.400> go<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.880> money<00:01:33.479> and
