 before debate always first you get off 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.019
 for tea we use the nap kettle 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.950
 then there are other materials for tea 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.950
 green 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.150
 for flowers 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.019
 it's a clay 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.960
 of better quality than what is clay 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.970
 our 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.020
 it is always cast from below 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.020
 this tea so you do not 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.800
 It has a color with a stone 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.150
 now if there is already has 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.150
 a taste and we remove them again 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.080
 it changes for what 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.200
 Do not take more flavor than you have to 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.200
 to have 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.090
 now we serve in 3-d 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.000
 as you see in the tc 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 it is served 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.010
 in three times 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.580
 if we leave 70% for 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.039
 and the other one is 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.039
 for harmony to forward to 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.529
 with the is with the small cup is 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.579
 let's go the glass 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.579
 retain its aroma 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.200
 the next gesture that we are going to make 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.200
 it is a symbol of what 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.969
 the fish 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.699
 jump dragon 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:00.230
 and he wishes us luck is with us 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.270
 subtracting luck 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.930
 to all of us who are having tea 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.780

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.290
 for business but there's no 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.520
 distinctions we are all of the same level 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.919

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.910
 tea is offered overhead to the head to 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.240
 others 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.540
