00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.500
 ae 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.509
 hello friends are you all very welcome 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.220
 again today with another video about 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.650
 financial education 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.089
 addressing the issue of personal finance and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.489
 more specifically the portfolio is 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.629
 keep the wallet organized 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.780
 for sure 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.910
 including this topic discussed has many 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 people who have a wallet 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.699
 extremely thick full of things that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.260
 do not need and end up losing 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.270
 documents ends up collecting vouchers 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 a myriad of things that do not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 they should be there 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 this helps to save with certainty if 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.340
 you know exactly what you put in a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.199
 coffee maker and will make a great 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 difference when it comes to helping 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.379
 personal finances 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.000
 Let's begin the first step to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.550
 people take the wallet is the first 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.350
 step for any cleaning done well 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.840
 That is take everything to speak 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.819
 we had everything out clean 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.649
 portfolio leave pretty cute 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.030
 Let's get all six types 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.250
 credit and debit cards 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
 documents business cards take everything 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.119
 wallet 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.039
 leaves there with nothing and the window nepad 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.119
 then we'll start by choosing the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.700
 documents 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.590
 If you drive your driver's license 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.229
 housing is enough already because everything 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 the country also as the wheel 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.530
 your rg and also the cpf number 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 if you do not drive just the rg is already the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.300
 enough many people usually 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.440
 including only a certified copy 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 of the original non rg is the planet card 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.229
 health and nothing more 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.119
 of documents is enough the cards 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.979
 credit 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.690
 always use at most two do not have a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.520
 infinity of cards 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.190
 always look for multiple cards already 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 also to do - I go in that wallet 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.080
 are those that were once so much for the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.569
 credit as an adept and to move 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.420
 your bank account also tells about 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.650
 exemptions from your 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.660
 and credit programs. 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.760
 fidelity ends up saving a lot 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.250
 so it is also important not to do 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.690
 people's cards have only one 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 card flags 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.640
 credits are accepted in all 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 merchant cards 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 credit and store usually have a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 hidden tariffs has the task to 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.890
 you have the card and end up offering 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.870
 a great advantage for you that a 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.820
 another well-studied card will not bring 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.320
 such as loyalty programs 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.060
 it is important to avoid costs 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.930
 unnecessary here the cards 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.630
 credit 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.460
 the next step is never checks 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.890
 I carried the whole bead 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.920
 always carry a single sheet and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.030
 crusade because they stand out do not 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.100
 a lightning-fast kidnapping 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.500
 You can even fire the boss, but until 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.200
 that this check compensates you can call 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.870
 to the bank and cancel this check 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.270
 oh I do not like chirac either 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.590
 already thought if you're in the restaurant 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.880
 no money how much or pay on the card 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.400
 and lack of light in the restaurant 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.060
 how do you make the machine will 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.670
 It's important to have a top chef. 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.340
 in case of emergencies the fifth step 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.860
 are the other cards I never carried 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.140
 Third-party business cards should 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.180
 only your business cards 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.980
 after all the first impression is that it counts 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.900
 You do not want the time that you go. 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.640
 give your business card to me I think 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.920
 that you are a correct organized person 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.980
 should at most 5 you can not either 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.780
 have a door cards at the entrance of your 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.450
 Wallet 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.010
 save credit cards and food 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.390
 always in the same place 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 in fact this is an important thing 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.360
 however that you carry within the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.850
 because if you create a routine 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.830
 the time you meet your eyes and see what 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.989
 the document is not clean and certainly 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.190
 It is automatically will remember 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.880
 search for it 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.489
 and the sooner you feel for lack 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.100
 of something more more chances of 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.750
 find if you have you will get another tip 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.989
 important is to leave the health card 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.480
 always in sight in a moment of urgency 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.990
 the person opened for his wallet to 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.289
 see who you are 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.910
 see a phone if you have a 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.560
 bad health state could not 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.000
 communicate and have the health card 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.789
 they will probably call your 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.680
 health plan also or proprime 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.419
 your non- direct health care agency 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.160
 with public services, which increases 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.630
 chances of success in the rescue 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.539
 the money is the most 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.970
 important for any ever cart 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:53.599
 more than one hundred reais in the portfolio of 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.160
 preferably a single note because the 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.710
 people think so and if you have two 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.720
 real in June come out I'm going to buy one 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.909
 dossier that will not be missing 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.509
 and this is something that ends up escaping from the 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.090
 control the main reason people 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.050
 not regular in finance assets is lack 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.180
 of control 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.490
 when you see these two is two 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.979
 dogs over a week are already 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.449
 ten reais that you ended up spending without 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.280
 need 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.620
 always search used credit card 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.319
 because this will prevent you from spending 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.120
 this single note at high value and also 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.830
 a way to inhibit spending 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.259
 unnecessary because many people have 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.020
 Shame over there in the diner pass. 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.500
 two reais in the credit card and also 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.449
 will give you other benefits like me 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.490
 I spoke before in the mileage programs 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.250
 program your company's loyalty 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.789
 credit card including help and 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.909
 the tasks that the card has 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.949
 plus get a few days to pay for 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.289
 finalize that our video lesson I in which 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.300
 some things you should not carry 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.190
 in the wallet 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.740
 any kind of proof 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.169
 carry no voucher in the wallet 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.419
 much less those who had the 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.009
 credit card though in your pocket and 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.289
 you will probably get along 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.330
 of the custom time to clean the pockets 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.729
 before washing the clothes and will finish 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.250
 awaiting proof in the ideal place 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.280
 the car document is in or in 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.229
 of the car or kept at home the cards 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.440
 loyalty should also not be 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.389
 loaded checkbooks much less 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.440
 business cards 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.539
 It will look like you're a person. 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.819
 disorganized 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.969
 always keep everything in the same 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.489
 place like that sneakers 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.279
 To make it easier, you missed a 

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:40.569
 thing that helps you find the most 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.569
 fast as possible 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.769
