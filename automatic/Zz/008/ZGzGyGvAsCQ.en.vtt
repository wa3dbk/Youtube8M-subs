that<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> digging<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> motor<00:01:04.379> too

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that for it digging in this motor too

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:13.340

deeply<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.510> pretty<00:01:10.170> loose<00:01:12.350> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
deeply so there's a pretty loose and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.429 
deeply so there's a pretty loose and
you've<00:01:13.470> got<00:01:14.299> one<00:01:15.299> radiator<00:01:15.780> hose<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you've got one radiator hose on the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
you've got one radiator hose on the
other<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> knee<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> undo<00:01:17.880> we're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
other side of the knee to the undo we're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.130 
other side of the knee to the undo we're
gonna<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> undo<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.320> bolt<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.140> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
gonna have to undo this bolt here and I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.160 
gonna have to undo this bolt here and I
believe<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:54.580 

that<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> 12<00:01:34.310> millimeter<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:54.290> can<00:01:54.440> use<00:01:54.560> a

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
that is a 12 millimeter you can use a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.320 
that is a 12 millimeter you can use a
socket<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.250> it's<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.460> little<00:01:55.670> awkward<00:01:55.790> angle

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
socket but it's a little awkward angle

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:07.109 
socket but it's a little awkward angle
so<00:02:04.930> I'm<00:02:05.930> gonna<00:02:06.050> go<00:02:06.140> ahead<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.350> remove<00:02:06.530> these

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
so I'm gonna go ahead and remove these

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.479 
so I'm gonna go ahead and remove these
and<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:08.539> I'll<00:02:09.050> show<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.500> next<00:02:09.649> steps<00:02:10.039> in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
and then I'll show you the next steps in

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.540 
and then I'll show you the next steps in
the<00:02:10.789> same<00:02:11.030> video<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:13.100> next<00:02:13.310> step<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.489> have

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
the same video on the next step you have

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.780 
the same video on the next step you have
to<00:02:13.670> do<00:02:13.820> as<00:02:14.090> far<00:02:14.150> as<00:02:14.739> things<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.980> remove<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
to do as far as things to remove and the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
the radiator hose and whatnot so stay

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.660 
the radiator hose and whatnot so stay
tuned<00:02:19.370> okay<00:02:21.100> now<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.220> we've<00:02:22.340> got<00:02:22.370> all<00:02:22.489> the
