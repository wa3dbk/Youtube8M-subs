00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
random generator and whatever number

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.370 
random generator and whatever number
comes<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> winner<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.450> 56<00:01:22.110> might

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
comes up that's the winner so 56 might

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830 
comes up that's the winner so 56 might
be<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> winner<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.400> 70<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.659> means

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
be the winner out of 70 and that means

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.410 
be the winner out of 70 and that means

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the 56th comment is the winner I go and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
the 56th comment is the winner I go and
scroll<00:01:27.689> through<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.590> harder<00:01:28.920> when

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
scroll through it and that's harder when

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.130 
scroll through it and that's harder when
it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.310> chosen<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.299> enter<00:01:30.720> it's
