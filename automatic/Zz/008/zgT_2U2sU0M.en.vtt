 decayed and collapsed 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.060

 pointed to the place where it is hidden 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.350
 honest head 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.570
 the monks went to that very place 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.960
 dug a shrine put it in a bag of 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.670
 camel wool and went to his house

 his potter has potters without even knowing 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.459
 what a precious burden carries quietly 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.950
 continued on with the monks, but by 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.680
 On the way a potter appeared at the holy forerunner 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.100
 pious christians 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.170
 not until she was in the hands of 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.620
 priest and paste and 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.840
 who contracted the Arian heresy he 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.750
 shamelessly enjoyed miracles 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.930
 of those who walked from an honest chapter giving them away 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.690
 for the grace of arianism but soon his 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.209
 blasphemy opened he hid and you don't 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.720
 in a cave near m and in the hope that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.819

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.310
 allowed 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.810
 later that same cave settled 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.239
 pious monks 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.239
