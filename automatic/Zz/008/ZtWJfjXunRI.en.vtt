go<00:00:00.390> so<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.530> Siemens<00:00:02.280> norm<00:00:02.580> or<00:00:02.760> 352

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
go so this is the Siemens norm or 352

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.240 
go so this is the Siemens norm or 352
controller<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.259> more<00:00:04.440> micro<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.130> it's

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
controller the more micro and it's

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.010 
controller the more micro and it's
purchased<00:00:05.580> later<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:05.910> by<00:00:06.060> Siemens<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.810> may

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
purchased later on by Siemens so it may

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.960 
purchased later on by Siemens so it may
refer<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.649> Siemens<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.490> book<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:08.910> it

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
refer to it as Siemens the book for it

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.580 
refer to it as Siemens the book for it
is<00:00:09.059> right<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.809> single<00:00:09.960> loop<00:00:10.200> controller

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
is right here the single loop controller

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.350 
is right here the single loop controller
and<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.400> gonna<00:00:11.550> step<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.940> through<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
and I'm gonna step you through how to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.950 
and I'm gonna step you through how to
set<00:00:12.480> some<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> basic<00:00:13.230> parameters<00:00:14.870> in<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.680 
set some of the basic parameters in the
back<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.440> handbook<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> loop

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
back of this handbook you have a loop

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.029 
back of this handbook you have a loop
they<00:00:18.810> call<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> loop<00:00:19.320> diagram<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:19.949> it's

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
they call it a loop diagram but it's

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.220 
they call it a loop diagram but it's

bottoms out at 50 it's actually 46.67

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.230 
bottoms out at 50 it's actually 46.67

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
because it's under range it will top out
