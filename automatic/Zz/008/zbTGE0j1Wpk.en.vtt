I've<00:00:22.890> worked<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> molecular<00:00:23.670> physics

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

thing<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.150> say<00:00:27.360> about<00:00:27.690> applied<00:00:28.680> physics

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
thing I can say about applied physics

thing I can say about applied physics
program<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.180> you<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.020> opportunity

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
program is that you have the opportunity

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to do what you want which is wonderful

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
to do what you want which is wonderful
gives<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> independence<00:00:35.699> it<00:00:36.300> gives<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> the

and<00:01:40.550> what<00:01:41.550> attracted<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.810> applied

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
and what attracted me to the applied

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.350 
and what attracted me to the applied
physics<00:01:43.290> program<00:01:43.910> here<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:45.330> just<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
physics program here was just the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.970 
physics program here was just the
breadth<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.660> research<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> University

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
very helpful and though you know they'll

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.370 
very helpful and though you know they'll
do<00:02:07.590> anything<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:08.460> just<00:02:08.790> feels<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:10.350> know

enjoy your time you at school and these

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.480 
enjoy your time you at school and these
are<00:02:15.360> people<00:02:15.600> who<00:02:15.630> successfully<00:02:16.410> even<00:02:17.190> gone

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
are people who successfully even gone

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.210 
are people who successfully even gone
into<00:02:17.640> academia<00:02:17.970> or<00:02:18.210> gone<00:02:18.540> into<00:02:18.780> industry<00:02:19.220> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
into academia or gone into industry I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.060 
into academia or gone into industry I
think<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:21.030> are<00:02:21.060> very<00:02:21.510> very<00:02:21.630> into<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
think that there are very very into the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.670 
think that there are very very into the
needs<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.400> bread<00:02:23.940> recipes<00:02:24.380> we're<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:25.500> very

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
needs of bread recipes we're all very

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.390
