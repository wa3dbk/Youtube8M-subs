 And there are many houses that do not have a router, and this time, 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.670

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.920
 This is very transferable because it's more direct than going through 2062

 Even though this is a very high quality video 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.210
 Oh, but I can get out without breaking. 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.909
