 Talk about beauty here. Who's there? 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.450
 talking is a phillipe and today we are going 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 to make a very nice pâté to make in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 house to galley 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.750
 he is very nutritious there I call pate 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 pump and it will help a lot in the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.480
 growth and fingerlings and strengthen the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.340
 your beckham with loops here my 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.019
 blast up to subway coordinate has 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
 the one that is the biggest that way but I 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.969
 I will not tell you why it's going to be a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.910
 subject for another video and I gave it here 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.739
 but it's not for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.020
 they you can use for them also 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.750
 reason but the reason will be especially 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 where the betas 14 clove garlic us 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.320
 will need it in shell and we will all go 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 aim at half a cup of rice cooked rice 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 already without oil is without salt and preferably 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 of the integral and integral galley he has 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 more fiber than the common is an egg with 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.909
 all bark and also here we have a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.010
 piece of liver to a fish that in my 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.830
 case is the shrimp 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.530
 you can use any other type of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.049
 fish has no problem and here too the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.380
 People have a little piece of carrot too. 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 Well, cool carrot, guys, this herb that is 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.229
 very good is an antibactericidal herb such as 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 It helps a lot in beta to call this 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.409
 and shica want to look for the fish 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.119
 We'll use it too, it's the reason I go. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.619
 use my here that until the glue 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.810
 you can use any reason that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.700
 there have also not not need to be 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 in the glue and I'll use a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 vitamin that the vital gold a vitamin 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 for animals, I also use it if the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.229
 my reasons 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 guys let's cut the liver into strips 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.270
 plays in the blender 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.430
 You also play the fish in the case of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.930
 shrimp and let's hit the first two 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 people do not tell you anything, it's not 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.849
 very powerful I do not want to burn it, right? 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590
 so let's hit at no speed 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.720
 It does not need to be mass they will hit only the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.720
 two is hitting the two well 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.530
 fought the two well guys can already 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.489
 play the ingredients already played 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.819
 half a cup of rice 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:41.040
 There's a cup and we're going to play. 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.099
 The game of our reason is if it is of 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.610
 balls and mash it like playing a the 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.160
 a pinch of fish from our grass and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.609
 Let's put three drops of our 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.670
 vitamin vita load to put three drop is 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:01.470
 you can see who yellow means 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:06.329
 cup of water and you're done now 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.209
 closes and hits her and maximum speed was 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.920
 mass speed lets you down until you 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.579

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.780
 cup of the blender in the form of 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.430

 I came back here and now it 's all already 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.060
 spread in the form and that we will 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.829
 do let us put in the preheat oven 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.129
 already heated to the ideal temperature 180graus 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.389
 180 people we put people and people 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.970

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.120
 we will not leave more than 15 minutes 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:14.010
 can not spend more than 15 minutes she feels 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:15.690
 8 o'clock the 15 minutes let's leave it is good 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 spent 15 minutes it will stay 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.620
 looking like a cake dough, right? 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.060
 but it is not ready yet so the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.280
 what are we going to do lets 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.280
 cool for about 40 minutes at 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.150
 cooled it we can see with texture 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.580
 his 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.660
 a nice person does not seem to do 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.210
 same 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.520
 Let's put it in the fridge now. 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.320

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.139

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.350
 Let's leave him there for a couple of 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.350
 hours 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 good guys spent two hours arises 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.600
 it can not rt their preference and 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.550
 remembering that it only lasts a week 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.889
 cover when you have protection in 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.470
 put some holes is ventilating 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.139
 illegal is when you focus on the court you 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.970
 take a small piece and play at 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.160
 Sometimes fish will not want to eat then 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.470
 You're cool, you leave him one day. 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.020
 days without eating because it will end 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.580
 eating our work in our 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.380
 Father, this is what we want. 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.210
 You can use any type of fish 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.610
