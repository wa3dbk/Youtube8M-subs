00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.640
 Neutron stars are one of the most extreme things in the universe. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.180
 They are like giant atom cores, how many in diameter. Incredibly dense, and violent. 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 But how could such a thing even exist? 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:28.260
 The life of a star dominated by two forces being in balance - its own attractiveness, the pressure of radiation from the interaction of fusion. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.380
 In the heart of the stars, hydrogen fuses into helium. Eventually, the hydrogen in the heart is exhausted. 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.720
 If the star is massive enough, helium is now fused to carbon. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.620
 The cores of these massive stars become layers like onions. As the nuclei heavier and heavier accumulate in the center. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:58.660
 Carbon is fused into neon, which leads to oxygen, leading to silicon. Eventually, the fusion reaction hits the iron, which can not merge into another element. 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.380
 When the fusion stops, the radiation pressure decreases rapidly. The star is no longer in equilibrium. 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 If the basic mass exceeds 1.4 solar masses, catastrophic collapse occurs. 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.880
 The outer part of the core reaches speeds of up to 70,000 km / s as it collapses towards the center of the star. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.440
 Now, the core forces within the atom are left only to fight the collapse of gravity. 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.120
 And overcome quantum mechanical dissonance of electrons, electrons and protons to neutrons valves, packed packed as an atomic nucleus. 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.620
 The outer layers of the star jumped into space, in the violent supernova explosion. 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 So, now we have a neutron star. Its mass is between 1 and 3 Suns, but its compression to an object is about 25 km wide. 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.420
 And 500,000 times the mass of the earth in this small ball. This is almost the diameter of Manhattan. 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.380
 It is so dense that one cubic centimeter of the neutron star contains the same cubic iron mass 700 meters wide. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.960
 This is approximately 1 billion tons, as extensive as Mount Everest, in the space of sugar cube size. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:31.880
 The gravity of the neutron star is very impressive, too. If you were to drop an object from 1 meter above the surface, it would hit the star at 1 microseconds, accelerating up to 7.2 million km / h. 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.720
 The surface is super flat, with irregularities of 5 mm maximum, with a thin atmosphere of hot plasma. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.460
 The surface temperature of the earth is about 1 million Kelvin, compared with our 5800 Kelvin sun. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:57.220
 Let's look inside the neutron star. The veneer is extremely hard, and most likely made of iron-nucleus lattice atom with a sea of ​​electrons flowing through it. 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:06.300
 The closer we get to the core, the more neutrons and fewer protons we see, so there is just an incredibly thick soup of neutrons that can be distinguished. 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:22.220
 The nuclei of the neutron stars are very, very strange. We are not sure what their possessions are, but our closest guess is super-degenerative neutron matter or some sort of super-dense quark question, called quark-gluon plasma. 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.560
 This does not make any sense in the traditional way, and can exist only in such an ultra-extreme environment. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.880
 In many ways, a neutron star is similar to the nucleus of a giant atom. The most important difference is that the atomic nuclei were held together by a strong interaction, 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120
 And neutron stars, by gravity. 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.760
 As if all of these were not severe enough, let's take a look at some other characteristics. Neutron stars spin very, very fast. 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.080
 Young people, several times per second. 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.380
 If there is a poor star nearby to feed the neutron star, it can spin up to several hundred times per second. 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 I would love to object PSRJ1748-2446ad. It is about 252 million kilometers per hour. 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.880
 This is very fast, that the star has a rather strange shape. We call these pulsars objects because they emit strong radio signals. 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.260
 The magnetic field of the neutral star is approximately one trillion times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field. 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.300
 So strong that the atoms get bent when they enter their influence. 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:35.160
 Well, I guess we got a point across. Neutron stars are some of the most extreme, but also some of the coolest things in the universe. 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.380
 Hopefully, we'll one day send the space ships to learn more about them and take some neat pictures. 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.780
 But we should not get too close.
