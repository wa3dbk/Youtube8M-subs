00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.059
 to me, what I really like is the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.410
 beer but the world what is full 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 of water 75% of the planet is h2o well 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.310
 that to know it well, you have to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.980
 dive that's what I do in this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.710
 section I travel to dive in the best 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 seabeds from all over the planet one of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 the most unique trips I 've made 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 in my life he has been a new idea to Papua 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 he had say a trip to one of the good 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 sure you've all seen those 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 documentaries of tribes in loincloths that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.469
 they live almost in good prehistory 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.929
 yes papúa is surprising in surface 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.289
 you can not imagine what is below 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.289
 of the water 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.650
 so much 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.650
 for the greens 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.320
 if indeed they are whale sharks 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.770
 the largest fish on the planet arrive 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.930
 to measure 12 to 14 and 17 meters 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 alexis whales are larger than 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.670
 whales are smart mammals 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.259
 no no no 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 exists 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.780
 whale sharks are the big ones 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 sea ​​travelers spend their lives 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.700
 turning the oceans around 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.500
 that huge mouth to eat fractal but 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 only here at this particular point of the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.370
 island of papua new guinea has been 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.370
 documented a very special case 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.649
 and 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.730
 the fiber 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.080
 ayala 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.080
 and be clear 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 --results 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:16.350
 I do not want 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.819
 as you see here they have become accustomed to 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.190
 eat sucking from the networks of 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.870
 fishermen a very strange behavior 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.700
 it has not been documented in any other 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.650
 place of the world and I have the honor of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.040
 say that I was among the first to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.040
 to film 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.200
 anxiety 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.020
 Y 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.590
 do not 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.800
 and if the seabed was 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.910
 made of beer until next time 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.910
 soaking adventure
