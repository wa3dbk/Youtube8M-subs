00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 all right 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 yes 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.880
 for me 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.650
 a front shot that passes hardly 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.019
 proposals 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 and 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:39.079
 it is still seeing like that you hear but we 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.079
 can they say in twitter accounts 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.890
 alfonso grandson already has good road when 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.090
 we insist pumas is dangerous and tied 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 very clear ways of goal 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 why 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 i 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.530
 it is clear that the most dangerous player 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.530
 having pueblas Alústiza matías 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.990
 and how it weighs as up is the one that failed 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.680
 dante and the one that failed grandson only 22 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.680
 in front of the goalkeeper 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 here has cabrera go four against 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 four good of cabrera has cabrera that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.549
 he returns to try villalpando del 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.899
 rebound has daniel ludueña nobody 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.899
 then it already delays to see ranking 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.659
 good 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.070
 there was a hand that is not marked because the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.460
 referee says he brings it 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.470
 to sank in the footprints matters 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.470
 it seems that the poblano puts his hand 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.390
 goat walking 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.239
 the fans ask the goalkeeper for a penalty 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.940
 worked before lopez and only granted 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 kick-off you will say the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.239
 they saw 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.510
 here the test populates and saldívar dry 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.510
 with that value 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.030
 the source sources that are entered not 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.190
 reaches nobody has danny ramirez and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.400
 ramirez opens for cuts court is going to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400
 try out 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.569
 ludueña ludueña poke the center clears 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.310
 well the espinoza saga fights that ball 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.849
 espinoza can not earn it but he has it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.849
 Luis Fuentes 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.460
 he's missing Luis Fuentes and he's shooting 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.710
 free and there's corner shot going to charge 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.720
 by the band on the right Daniel 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.880
 ludueña ismael you know the first 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.740
 important participation that you have and the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.990
 first concrete comes the center 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.460
 for Luis source is the clear the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.870
 defense has it daniel ramírez is going to 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.710
 put the center and there's another shot of 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.710
 more corner q 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.150
 corner shot that charges the take out the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.319
 defense again daniel ramírez 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.319
 learn more 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.560
 do not 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.540
 when 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.420
 I tried the match and the fans instead 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.520
 of booing the players applaud them 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.060
 in this last game of cougars in the 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.060
 2013 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.660
 but he 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.180
 a good parameter of this match for 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.800
 which is coming next Sunday in 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.740
 university town and I think so 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.430
 let's know how to conjugate the town we are going to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740
 know their movements and this 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.390
 but we are well focused on what 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.850
 which is not to continue preparing to follow 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.240
 improving and good and ready for the 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.720
 Sunday we are at the point right now and 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:52.780
 with all the way 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:57.630
 then it is working that the 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:11.949
 we finish well different 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:13.780
 with the analyst marker tomorrow but 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.729
 simply the team has to see this 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.460
 what we have to do from above 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.340
 to be able to defend and good the base that 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.290
 we had had as a document while 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.910
 of goal that if we really put 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.130
 the macarons were not so tight 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.470
 like the games in cons as a favorite 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.660
 out there today we did not want to face 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.540
 with that because we played the first date 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.950
 so I hope all the matches are 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.360
 different no match is the same 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.370
 that this helps us to grab 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.960
 confidence to grab football rhythm and 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.920
 to draw conclusions when it 's true 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.980
 what 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.910
 despite the defeat of the team 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.910
 team team 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.030
 one 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.730
 and we are doing very well 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.420
 and this week we have to close my 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.170
 prepaid 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.170
 Sunday
