00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.539 

when<00:00:04.220> you<00:00:04.310> use<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:04.730> bun<00:00:04.940> for<00:00:06.250> by<00:00:07.250> the<00:00:07.310> way

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:07.549 
when you use the bun for by the way

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.430 
when you use the bun for by the way
sometimes<00:00:08.029> when<00:00:08.420> you<00:00:08.510> get<00:00:08.719> these<00:00:08.900> they're

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
sometimes when you get these they're

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.280 
sometimes when you get these they're
really<00:00:09.799> stiff<00:00:10.430> and<00:00:10.639> you<00:00:10.879> can't<00:00:11.180> get<00:00:11.570> them<00:00:11.780> over

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
really stiff and you can't get them over

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.350 
really stiff and you can't get them over
so<00:00:12.950> you<00:00:13.040> actually<00:00:13.280> just<00:00:13.580> stretch<00:00:14.059> them<00:00:14.240> out

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
so you actually just stretch them out

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.520 
so you actually just stretch them out
okay<00:00:15.110> and<00:00:15.320> that's<00:00:15.440> fine<00:00:15.740> to<00:00:15.980> do<00:00:16.130> okay

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.710 

from<00:00:22.250> here<00:00:22.700> you<00:00:23.210> center<00:00:23.690> that<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.200> you<00:00:24.620> go<00:00:24.830> up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
from here you center that and you go up

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.630 
from here you center that and you go up
probably<00:00:26.720> about<00:00:26.870> three<00:00:27.380> quarters<00:00:27.650> toward<00:00:28.520> the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
probably about three quarters toward the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.990 
probably about three quarters toward the
top<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:29.300> pulled<00:00:29.630> down<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.490> then<00:00:31.490> you<00:00:31.640> pin

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
top you pulled down and then you pin

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.820 
top you pulled down and then you pin
into<00:00:32.870> your<00:00:33.590> hair<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:34.580> toward<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.000> hair<00:00:35.180> binder

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
from here like earlier you go up into

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.830 
from here like earlier you go up into
the<00:02:28.209> hair<00:02:29.189> you<00:02:30.189> grab<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.939> hairnet<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.599> the

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
hair you pulled down and then you tuck

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.709 
hair you pulled down and then you tuck
it<00:02:34.120> into<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.719> base<00:02:35.079> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.709> bun<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.450> ones

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
it into the base of the bun the ones

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.360 
it into the base of the bun the ones
that<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.049> put<00:02:38.349> in<00:02:38.469> that<00:02:38.590> we're<00:02:38.739> loose<00:02:39.040> I'm

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
that I put in that we're loose I'm

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.479 
that I put in that we're loose I'm
actually<00:02:39.700> pulling<00:02:40.269> out<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.950> I'm<00:02:42.219> going

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
actually pulling out and as I'm going

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.629 
actually pulling out and as I'm going
around<00:02:42.639> and<00:02:43.269> working<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.840> shaping<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:45.370> bun

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
around and working on shaping the bun

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:56.069 
around and working on shaping the bun
into<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> nice<00:02:46.450> circle<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.959> would

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
into a nice circle and you would

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.159 
into a nice circle and you would
continue<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.769> all<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.189> way<00:02:57.310> around

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
continue that all the way around

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.690 
continue that all the way around
sometimes<00:02:59.169> I<00:02:59.349> see<00:02:59.590> people<00:02:59.620> forget<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.489> ones

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
sometimes I see people forget the ones

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.879 
sometimes I see people forget the ones
at<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.939> bottom<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.719> then<00:03:02.169> the<00:03:02.290> bun<00:03:02.500> starts

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
at the bottom and then the bun starts

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.800 
at the bottom and then the bun starts
pulling<00:03:03.310> away<00:03:03.459> from<00:03:03.790> their<00:03:03.969> head<00:03:04.209> after<00:03:04.719> you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
pulling away from their head after you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.530 
pulling away from their head after you
put<00:03:05.049> your<00:03:05.200> head<00:03:05.379> back<00:03:05.590> push<00:03:06.250> then<00:03:07.209> you're

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
put your head back push then you're

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.179 
put your head back push then you're
going<00:03:07.689> to<00:03:07.780> create<00:03:08.049> some<00:03:08.290> tension<00:03:08.739> so<00:03:08.919> that<00:03:08.950> you

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
going to create some tension so that you

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.849 
going to create some tension so that you
can<00:03:09.430> shape<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.389> bun<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.230> bit<00:03:11.349> more<00:03:11.650> and

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
can shape the bun a little bit more and

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.879 
can shape the bun a little bit more and
keep<00:03:12.219> it<00:03:12.400> closer<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.879> your<00:03:13.299> head<00:03:13.629> so<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.620> the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
keep it closer to your head so that the

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.220 
keep it closer to your head so that the
fun<00:03:15.159> is<00:03:15.459> close<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:16.150> your<00:03:16.269> head<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.629> attaches<00:03:16.989> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
fun is close to your head it attaches to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.690 
fun is close to your head it attaches to
your<00:03:17.379> head<00:03:17.590> as<00:03:17.709> opposed<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.069> just<00:03:18.129> being<00:03:18.280> loose

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
your head as opposed to just being loose

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.369 
your head as opposed to just being loose
out<00:03:18.969> there<00:03:19.000> because<00:03:19.329> when<00:03:19.569> it's<00:03:19.719> loose<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.230> can

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
out there because when it's loose it can

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.009 
out there because when it's loose it can
fall<00:03:20.680> out<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.879> would<00:03:22.090> continue<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.750> all

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
fall out so you would continue that all

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.559 
fall out so you would continue that all
the<00:03:23.199> way<00:03:23.290> around

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.780 

so<00:03:29.379> sometimes<00:03:29.620> as<00:03:29.950> you're<00:03:30.129> working<00:03:30.280> things

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
so sometimes as you're working things

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.550 
so sometimes as you're working things
start<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.120> get<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.329> little<00:03:31.420> frizzier<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.349> out

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
start to get a little frizzier so out

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.289 
start to get a little frizzier so out
comes<00:03:32.769> your<00:03:33.010> hairspray<00:03:33.280> I'm<00:03:33.609> going<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:33.969> spare

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
comes your hairspray I'm going to spare

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.209
