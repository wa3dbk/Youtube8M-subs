of<00:01:35.130> o<00:01:35.280> 9<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> increase

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
of o 9 you know that when you increase

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
of o 9 you know that when you increase
prices<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> lose<00:01:38.549> some

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.060 
prices that you're going to lose some
customers<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:41.450> calculated<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
customers and so we calculated that

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.499

Madison Metro has an elasticity model
and<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:46.259> predicted<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.860> even<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> fare

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and we predicted that even with the fare

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.499 
and we predicted that even with the fare
increase<00:01:49.040> we<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.310> continue<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> grow

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
increase we would continue to grow

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.550 
increase we would continue to grow
