00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.310 
and fatica Lee yes you will be at the
quarterback<00:04:10.490> position<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:11.420> so<00:04:11.990> after<00:04:12.290> that

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
quarterback position and so after that

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:25.400 
quarterback position and so after that
it's<00:04:12.860> been<00:04:13.130> smooth<00:04:13.640> sellings<00:04:14.120> ever<00:04:14.300> since

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.300 

while<00:04:26.010> Eric<00:04:26.400> Russell<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:27.590> obviously<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.980> great

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
while Eric Russell was obviously a great

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.210 
while Eric Russell was obviously a great
football<00:04:29.790> coach<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.510> as<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.680> get<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.010> play

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
football coach but as you get to play

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.280 
football coach but as you get to play
form<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.030> got<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.230> more<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.830> more<00:04:35.430> of

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
form and got to know more is more of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.080 
form and got to know more is more of
what<00:04:37.290> he<00:04:37.410> taught<00:04:37.680> us<00:04:37.860> about<00:04:38.070> pursuit<00:04:38.970> of

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
what he taught us about pursuit of

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.120 
what he taught us about pursuit of
greatness<00:04:39.360> that's<00:04:39.780> what<00:04:40.050> comes<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.710> mind<00:04:40.920> when

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
greatness that's what comes to mind when

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.550 
greatness that's what comes to mind when
I<00:04:41.160> think<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.580> Coach<00:04:41.760> Russell<00:04:42.270> was<00:04:42.440> what<00:04:43.440> it

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
I think of Coach Russell was what it

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.980 
I think of Coach Russell was what it
takes<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:43.980> pursue<00:04:44.340> greatness<00:04:44.640> he<00:04:45.540> paved<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
takes to pursue greatness he paved the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.210 
takes to pursue greatness he paved the
way<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:47.460> showed<00:04:48.210> us<00:04:48.450> what<00:04:48.720> greatness<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.890> what

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
way and showed us what greatness is what

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.980 
way and showed us what greatness is what
it<00:04:50.340> looks<00:04:50.520> like<00:04:50.700> on<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.210> off<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.450> field<00:04:51.660> I

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
it looks like on and off the field I

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.960 
it looks like on and off the field I
couldn't<00:04:52.680> think<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.890> just<00:04:53.070> one<00:04:53.400> word<00:04:53.700> that

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
couldn't think of just one word that

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.820 
couldn't think of just one word that
just<00:04:54.120> summed<00:04:54.690> up<00:04:54.780> coach<00:04:55.080> Russell<00:04:55.530> there's<00:04:55.680> too

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
just summed up coach Russell there's too

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.310 
just summed up coach Russell there's too
many<00:04:56.480> adjectives<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.540> describe<00:04:57.630> him<00:04:58.230> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
many adjectives that describe him the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.780 
many adjectives that describe him the
too<00:04:58.470> many<00:04:58.620> things<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:58.950> he's<00:04:59.160> done<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.430> people

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
too many things that he's done to people

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.840 
too many things that he's done to people
I<00:05:00.180> would<00:05:00.810> say<00:05:00.990> he's<00:05:01.170> a<00:05:01.200> leader<00:05:01.440> he's<00:05:01.620> a

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
I would say he's a leader he's a

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.880 
I would say he's a leader he's a
spiritual<00:05:02.850> leader<00:05:03.030> as<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.600> communicator<00:05:04.320> he's

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
spiritual leader as a communicator he's

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.680 
spiritual leader as a communicator he's
a<00:05:04.920> motivator<00:05:05.550> he's<00:05:05.790> all<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.090> those<00:05:06.180> things<00:05:06.480> and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
a motivator he's all of those things and

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.210 
a motivator he's all of those things and
I<00:05:06.780> think<00:05:06.960> that's<00:05:07.110> what<00:05:07.260> makes<00:05:07.470> people<00:05:07.740> makes

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
I think that's what makes people makes

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.730 
I think that's what makes people makes
make<00:05:08.700> people<00:05:09.150> great<00:05:09.360> is<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:10.200> know<00:05:10.260> he<00:05:10.410> was<00:05:10.530> all

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
make people great is you know he was all

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.170 
make people great is you know he was all
those<00:05:10.950> things<00:05:11.010> he<00:05:11.340> was<00:05:11.460> good<00:05:11.700> at<00:05:11.790> all<00:05:11.940> of<00:05:12.060> those

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
those things he was good at all of those

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.360 
those things he was good at all of those
things<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:13.050> I've<00:05:13.320> kind<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.560> separated<00:05:14.100> from

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
things and I've kind of separated from

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.190 
things and I've kind of separated from
the<00:05:14.610> average<00:05:14.820> coach<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.720> average<00:05:15.960> person

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
the average coach and the average person

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.470 
the average coach and the average person
but<00:05:17.010> it's<00:05:17.160> obviously<00:05:17.520> why<00:05:17.670> we're<00:05:17.910> having

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
but it's obviously why we're having

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.150 
but it's obviously why we're having
these<00:05:18.660> conversations<00:05:18.870> today<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.860> he's<00:05:20.130> been

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
these conversations today and he's been

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.520 
these conversations today and he's been
able<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.610> leave<00:05:21.000> his<00:05:21.150> legacy<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.690> in<00:05:22.050> his

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
able to leave his legacy that in his

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.720 
able to leave his legacy that in his
death<00:05:22.740> that<00:05:22.920> we're<00:05:23.100> still<00:05:23.280> talking<00:05:23.670> about

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
death that we're still talking about

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.220 
death that we're still talking about
coach<00:05:24.120> Russell<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.750> that's<00:05:24.870> what<00:05:25.050> makes

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
coach Russell and that's what makes

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.570 
coach Russell and that's what makes
people<00:05:25.320> special<00:05:25.980> that's<00:05:26.160> what<00:05:26.280> makes<00:05:26.400> him

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
people special that's what makes him

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.500 
people special that's what makes him
special<00:05:26.700> I<00:05:27.380> think<00:05:28.380> he<00:05:28.500> treated<00:05:28.890> everybody

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
special I think he treated everybody

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.390 
special I think he treated everybody
that<00:05:30.510> he<00:05:30.600> came<00:05:30.750> in<00:05:30.960> contact<00:05:31.170> with<00:05:31.530> right<00:05:32.250> they

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
that he came in contact with right they

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.030 
that he came in contact with right they
were<00:05:32.490> special<00:05:33.320> he<00:05:34.320> didn't<00:05:34.590> read<00:05:34.680> him<00:05:34.800> out<00:05:34.920> of
