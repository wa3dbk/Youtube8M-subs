00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:10.189
 so that's the tablet as it 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.189
 presents itself in its home format 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.120
 all in all quite nice 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.439
 find all that we are used to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.270
 find under android 1 for those who have 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 a little used to android 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.490
 so here we have several apps 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 so note something that is still 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.890
 not uninteresting of origin on this 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.960
 tablet have 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.070
 when we have established a wifi connection 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.220
 registered an account 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.750
 it has the strongest which is when 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.280
 even important since that means 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.440
 we can download all 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.720
 applications where everything because I'm going 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.850
 not lie to you i think that's 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 difficult to turn games 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.280
 state of the art like need for speed or end 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.559
 really games that claims a little bit of 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.680
 memory and a processor a little a 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.130
 little beefy but well here I am 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.140
 installed a gray bird and some apps 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.110
 which dino for what nanosaur for actually 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.420
 they know and something that steals 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.250
 so it happens to run and not 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.350
 too bad so that's so after the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.710
 internet browsing so here I'm not going 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.720
 to be able to talk about it too much because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.670
 I put a protection software 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.860
 minor since this tablet is addressing 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.929
 to a child and it turns out that you see 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.450
 there the small inset that light up 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.300
 this software is so good that they 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.939
 block all one so I only have access to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.310
 a junior page so they give me 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.570
 sites but in this case 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.759
 I wanted to make you see youtube 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.829
 to show you a little video demo 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.430
 but that's not going to be the case since we do not 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.890
 can not access it 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.680
 I will come back later with another 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.880
 tablet I bought that even there 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.350
 it will not be blocked I will make you 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.450
 have a little video quality on 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.299
 youtube right now is interested 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.759
 internet so I sailed a little it is 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.950
 pleasant we will go back to the page 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.509
 home the camera is fine 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.690
 as I wanted to say it's not a 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.970
 lightning is not it's not the goal 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.700
 see for example I'm in the dark 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.940
 we distinguish nothing at all so really 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.270
 a very weak sensor 0.3 it's 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.660
 really the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.130
 the minimum between brackets must 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.430
 not hope to make the photo with 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.900
 so what else then a little 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.020
 a nice little app there are my book 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.030
 so but book a little book app 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.450
 that will allow the child's bath to 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.820
 to read on the table is to read 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.290
 ebook formats comics things that you 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.130
 find on the internet or in the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.750
 playsport that's pretty nice 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.140
 you see for example well we're going 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.550
 pass to fable fable so me who 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.010
 own android and that's game it's 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.600
 plus a pretty enough booklet app 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.880
 known I will not quote any brand 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.450
 I find that this one is rather 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.110
 friendly that's okay see I turn then 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.150
 I have there the pages are happening in make the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.070
 of course see there reading is when 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.290
 even pretty well enough pretty friendly 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.030
 well here it is a machine after all 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.580
 for 60 euros 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.430
 you get what you pay for and I repeat 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.590
 always this capacitive screen then 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.600
 capacitive it's the screen like most 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.130
 of our incomparable mobile phones 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.110
 we're going to say an iphone is the most 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.459
 known 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.830
 unlike the resistive screen that him 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.709
 is a screen you know to touch 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.480
 supple soft tends a little this bar and 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.670
 under the fingers and not to be it's 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.830
 not very reactive what a there we have a 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.680
 resistive screen which allows to have 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.600
 several to the supports on the screen so of 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.590
 dispose of the method you know the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.020
 pincer method to make 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.050
 enlargements and and that's so I'm going 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.900
 to iron a little on the internet then you 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.030
 see the device passing landscape 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.670
 is automatically so who has 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.770
 gyroscopes there is everything you need 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.240
 I make you have the mode so that I 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.040
 you explained multipoint so the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.560
 multipoint that's it that's the fact 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.600
 to be able to touch the screen at 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.520
 several places and to make 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.470
 enlargements and it has many more 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.960
 applications among others for games 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.940
 so you can do almost anything 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.510
 with this tablet I find that 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.310
 it is rather a good product 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.710
 I was tempted by the sirens 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.340
 lexibook and children's brands 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.440
 but then frankly stop because it 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.660
 that sells products that lexibook 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.990
 does not give access to anything at all and that's 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.660
 blocked while there you had to android 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.210
 you have parental control possible 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.980
 and my faith it works well the child can 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.500
 do everything and it's quite nice 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.080
 so I can not wait to be at Christmas and see 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.590
 my children turned on it here I am 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.020
 thank you 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.090
 I wish you good purchases of 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.640
 good Christmas and see you soon 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.920
 android normandy for new 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.540
 trials of new smartphones and 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.600
 new tablets goodbye and to 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.600
 soon
