00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and I didn't think I was doing that as a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.729 
and I didn't think I was doing that as a
quarterback<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.900> made<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> switch

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
quarterback so I made the switch

justin<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.510> good<00:02:16.690> athlete<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.290> believe

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
justin is is a good athlete I do believe

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.949 
justin is is a good athlete I do believe
that<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.580> skill<00:02:19.060> set<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.360> he<00:02:19.569> offers

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
that the skill set that he offers

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.600 
that the skill set that he offers
probably<00:02:20.380> better<00:02:20.560> suited<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.040> receiver<00:02:21.430> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
probably better suited as a receiver and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.370 
probably better suited as a receiver and
it<00:02:21.700> would<00:02:21.819> be<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.599> quarterback<00:02:23.019> at<00:02:23.260> this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
it would be as a quarterback at this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.500 
it would be as a quarterback at this
level<00:02:23.560> whether<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.130> was<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.940> quarterback

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
level whether it was as a quarterback

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.270 
level whether it was as a quarterback
you<00:02:25.690> know<00:02:25.750> taking<00:02:26.230> big<00:02:26.470> hits<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.950> remember

the<00:02:42.220> day<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.549> he<00:02:43.090> had<00:02:43.209> high<00:02:43.360> expectations<00:02:43.930> of

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
the day and he had high expectations of

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:44.370 
the day and he had high expectations of
himself

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
himself

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.100 
himself
