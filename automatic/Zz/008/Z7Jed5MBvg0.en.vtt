been<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> first<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.780> they<00:02:09.899> felt

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
been in the first one I think they felt

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.089 
been in the first one I think they felt
like<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.470> was<00:02:10.560> an<00:02:10.649> out-of-body<00:02:11.039> experience

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
like it was an out-of-body experience

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.030 
like it was an out-of-body experience
those<00:02:11.940> first<00:02:12.209> couple<00:02:12.360> days<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.890> don't<00:02:14.010> even

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
those first couple days and I don't even

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.509 
those first couple days and I don't even
know<00:02:14.569> what<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.720> character<00:02:16.110> says<00:02:16.410> anymore<00:02:17.220> or

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
know what the character says anymore or

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.949 
know what the character says anymore or
how<00:02:17.730> they<00:02:17.879> talk<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.390> walk<00:02:18.599> or<00:02:18.660> move<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.940> I

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
how they talk or walk or move and I

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.940 
how they talk or walk or move and I
think<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.049> big<00:02:22.370> adjustment<00:02:23.370> period<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.950> yet

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
think a big adjustment period and yet

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
think a big adjustment period and yet
for<00:02:26.239> my<00:02:27.239> eyes<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.720> looked<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.019> everyone<00:02:28.410> just

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
for my eyes it looked like everyone just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
for my eyes it looked like everyone just
