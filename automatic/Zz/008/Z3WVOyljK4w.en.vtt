actually thought about it over the next

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.940 
actually thought about it over the next
couple<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.850> weeks<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.319> really<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.350> came<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
couple of weeks and really I came to the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.979 
couple of weeks and really I came to the
conclusion<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.120> definition<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.630> Bernie

really think it should be taken as an

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.770 
really think it should be taken as an
insult<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.190> feel<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> name<00:03:22.150> itself<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.750> a

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
insult I feel that the name itself is a

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.509 
insult I feel that the name itself is a
little<00:03:23.079> redundant<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.070> someone<00:03:24.340> were<00:03:24.459> to

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
little redundant but if someone were to

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.479 
little redundant but if someone were to
ask<00:03:24.640> me<00:03:25.090> are<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> brony<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:26.430> wouldn't<00:03:27.430> be
