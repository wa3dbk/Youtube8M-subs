00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
always love games board games i was

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.609 
always love games board games i was
always<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.360> competitive<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.530> was

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
always really competitive and i was

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.770 
always really competitive and i was
playing<00:01:49.829> online<00:01:49.979> poker<00:01:50.189> mostly<00:01:51.060> i<00:01:51.240> wasn't<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
playing online poker mostly i wasn't the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.149 
playing online poker mostly i wasn't the
best<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.619> still<00:01:54.380> winning<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.100> I

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
best but i was still winning so I

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
best but i was still winning so I
graduated<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.759> no.3<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> guess<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.200> started

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
graduated in no.3 so I guess I started

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
graduated in no.3 so I guess I started
playing<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.549> probably<00:01:59.790> 01<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.840> turns<00:02:01.049> out

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
playing and probably 01 as it turns out

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.760 
playing and probably 01 as it turns out
because<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.509> during<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> break<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.380> 0<00:02:04.590> 2

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
because I in the during the break of 0 2
