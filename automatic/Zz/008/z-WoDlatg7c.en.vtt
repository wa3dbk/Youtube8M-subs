00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
so back later hey I'm back it's been

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.910 
so back later hey I'm back it's been
about<00:02:32.120> half<00:02:32.270> an<00:02:32.450> hour<00:02:32.510> or<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:32.930> since<00:02:33.560> I've<00:02:33.800> had

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
about half an hour or so since I've had

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.680 
about half an hour or so since I've had
it<00:02:33.980> I've<00:02:34.400> had<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.760> rearrange<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.330> slightly

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it I've had to rearrange it slightly

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.200 
it I've had to rearrange it slightly
because<00:02:35.870> some<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> my<00:02:36.410> hair<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.680> falling<00:02:36.800> out

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
because some of my hair is falling out

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.330 
because some of my hair is falling out
okay<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.930> best<00:02:39.110> way<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.290> do<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:40.010> just

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
okay and the best way to do this is just

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.220 
okay and the best way to do this is just
to<00:02:40.670> pull<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.000> off<00:02:41.060> ready<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.900> talk<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.170> a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
to pull it off ready you just talk to a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.660 
to pull it off ready you just talk to a
bit<00:02:42.380> careful<00:02:42.740> because<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.980> course<00:02:43.250> your<00:02:43.430> hairs

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
bit careful because of course your hairs

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.850 
bit careful because of course your hairs
wrapped<00:02:43.940> around<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.440> as<00:02:45.650> you're

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
wrapped around it so just as you're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.980 
wrapped around it so just as you're
pulling<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.280> off<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:47.510> slowly<00:02:47.690> pull<00:02:47.930> your

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
pulling it off just slowly pull your

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.160 
pulling it off just slowly pull your
hair<00:02:48.230> out<00:02:48.940> now<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.330> only<00:02:50.480> being<00:02:50.720> for<00:02:51.020> half

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
hair out now this is only being for half

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.200 
hair out now this is only being for half
the<00:02:51.350> network<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.980> colors<00:02:52.340> aren't<00:02:52.550> really

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
the network so the colors aren't really

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.020 
the network so the colors aren't really
defined<00:02:53.540> yet<00:02:53.860> but<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.070> can<00:02:55.250> see<00:02:55.490> how<00:02:55.760> they're

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
defined yet but you can see how they're

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.780 
defined yet but you can see how they're
starting<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.990> go<00:02:57.380> they're<00:02:58.220> just<00:02:58.250> kind<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.610> more

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
starting to go they're just kind of more

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
starting to go they're just kind of more
waves<00:02:59.320> and<00:03:00.320> curls<00:03:00.680> I'd<00:03:00.950> say<00:03:01.220> but<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.090> really

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
waves and curls I'd say but I really

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.210 
waves and curls I'd say but I really
like<00:03:02.960> this<00:03:03.140> look<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.470> think<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.800> great<00:03:03.950> and

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
like this look I think it's great and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.700 
like this look I think it's great and
say<00:03:05.090> if<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.480> do<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:05.750> overnight<00:03:06.020> your<00:03:06.440> curls

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
say if you do this overnight your curls

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.770 
say if you do this overnight your curls
will<00:03:06.920> be<00:03:07.010> quite<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.580> they'll<00:03:08.330> be<00:03:08.450> quite<00:03:08.630> well

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
will be quite on they'll be quite well

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.300 
will be quite on they'll be quite well
defined<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.680> could<00:03:09.800> just<00:03:09.980> brush<00:03:10.160> them

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
defined and you could just brush them

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.670 
defined and you could just brush them
out<00:03:10.480> but<00:03:11.480> yet<00:03:11.660> all<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.990> need<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.380> start

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
out but yet all you need to do is start

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.070 
out but yet all you need to do is start
a<00:03:12.710> bit<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:13.010> hairspray<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:17.209> then<00:03:17.420> one<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:17.840> and

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
a bit of hairspray and then one up and

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.650 
a bit of hairspray and then one up and
the<00:03:18.920> top<00:03:19.130> bit<00:03:19.340> obviously<00:03:19.880> wasn't<00:03:20.120> caught<00:03:20.450> in

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
the top bit obviously wasn't caught in

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.170 
the top bit obviously wasn't caught in
so<00:03:20.930> when<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.470> do<00:03:21.740> it<00:03:21.890> just<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.820> note<00:03:23.000> make

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
so when you do it just like a note make

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.550 
so when you do it just like a note make
sure<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.480> get<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:23.840> bits<00:03:24.110> wrapped<00:03:24.380> around

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
sure you get these bits wrapped around

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.590 
sure you get these bits wrapped around
properly<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.370> probably<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.120> missed<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.480> by

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
properly I probably just missed it by

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.670 
properly I probably just missed it by
accident<00:03:27.020> so<00:03:27.290> all<00:03:28.010> right<00:03:28.100> enjoy
