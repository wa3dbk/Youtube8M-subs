00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I came back and today I came back with the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.930
 very interesting topic 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.900
 You can see us here on top of a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.750
 Fan and today I'll talk a little bit 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.320
 protection against their birds is a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 way to protect them in a way to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.300
 The first one I'll talk about is that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.119
 fans can see it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.180
 was up here but if you want 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.960
 keep a player on you places 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.969
 the lid that comes in it always comes that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.200
 that degrades and stops 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:48.379
 soft protection will not go to insecurity and 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.110
 even more this heat that is there 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.910
 You can enjoy your being and nothing. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.260
 without danger 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.850
 the second method that the window is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:10.430
 here super awesome on the screen 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:14.720
 I recommend until then because the screen because 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:19.439
 soft on the head not bare soft enjoys 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.479
 from a sun of natural light to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.299
 My life, we stay a long time, I'm 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.350
 Your head does not like to be too long. 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.990
 loose time and I also have time to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.430
 stay with them all the time loose but her 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.549
 end up not sunning then the screen that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 I use that one right here in plastic. 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.420
 because they do not stay that long 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.899
 in the room and it also does not stay on top 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.030
 screen to destroy but also sells 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.560
 those of wire and super also that makes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.530
 live these things 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 So they enjoy a sun they have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.049
 natural lighting and security 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.200
 even with the wings the stops that is not the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.290
 Noah 's case is safer. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.340
 You have a method of everything but what I 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:16.890
 I'm going to say that now it's also about the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:21.090
 places that they will take 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.430
 always so taken is not 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.459
 there is danger if you have 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.930
 of the type 'do not leave or not only this to 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:37.099
 trip was a victory just take one 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.170
 shock will be fatal 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.650
 I have always been keeping an eye on her. 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.650
 if I pick up 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.170
 The ball stayed with us. 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.390
 it her and further in is loose 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.930
 stabilizer here is such that part of the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.600
 take that skeeter dust is gets always 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.100
 turning it so that it faces the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.830
 singing that she does not reach and joking 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.800
 a little string and also what he looks at 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.250
 This is what I said here for you to see. 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.770
 pens what pointy things 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.990
 stay here and place themselves in the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.900
 lives on the island in a vase a little more 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.900
 little background he will not get hurt 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.600
 and not get hurt 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.690
 you scissors these have no tips 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.280
 but I think it has always counts action 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:47.600
 Scissor head down does not have 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.640
 restrictions only if you are to leave it 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.440
 loose in this space where the 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.800
 new products cleaning products 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.920
 everything is always well closed to them 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.570
 do not even have the risk of eating or 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.670
 ingestion of any cleaning agent 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.670
 end up going bad 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.080
 for this I believe that it has no risk 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.080
 none 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.080
 is 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:31.880
 My computer here is closed because 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:39.830
 the judge he knew 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:42.700
 He is closed and who votes. 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.700
 the company with 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.890
 play 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:57.710
 in a canoe when I leave work already 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.650
 and I do not really want my 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.599
 computer type only thinking of course 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:10.330
 I'd rather close it and go back with her. 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.330
 I will use is always done always watching 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.520
 in mesh of each pair of scissors the pencils 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:22.789
 tip of pencil needle woman not fatal 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.789
 leaves a needle then these were my 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.240
 tips 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:32.630
 in the case of the window you can stop the 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.060
 water of the clave sometimes I recommend 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:43.610
 Why is it that someday escapes I know that? 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:45.759
 He attacks does not attack mine. I got one. 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.759
 do it 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.820
 What happens here tomorrow? 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.770
 So these were my tips and 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.480
 I hope you liked it today. 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.050
 enjoy taking good care of your pets 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.050
 Short the page and that's it.
