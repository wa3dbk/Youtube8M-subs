00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 difficult visit to germany of the real 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.200
 madrid that, as we already know, does not 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.690
 he's very good at the westfalenstadion 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 one of the largest bleachers in the world 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 and there the hobby clothes and much to the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.690
 borussia to a borussia that surely 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.820
 until the last minute is not going to know is going to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 have a significant low that is the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.539
 second is the Turk who is the one who moves 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 the team that came to replace the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 Nuri Sahin has back problems 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.140
 and it is probably not low 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 important but still has good 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.360
 players has a couple of centrals that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.700
 The truth is that they are the best 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 for europe as are hummels the German 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.870
 that they finished a big team without a doubt and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 subotic two central ones that go well to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
 cut that are fast and little eyes 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 played at set pieces because both 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.670
 we go very well in the head and then three 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.329
 court rooms forward have 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.070
 fantasy 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.560
 they have 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.530
 something different from what the rest has 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.480
 of equipment that are mario götze that 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.580
 usually part on the right but not 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.250
 it's a pure end because it starts with the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.810
 right but you get also by the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.119
 center dribbling dribbler 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.369
 skillful difficult to pull and that you're going to 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.380
 create much danger as we say let's say 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.119
 if this is the area outside the area 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.910
 always always outside the area and 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.320
 looking inside and in case it was little 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.360
 with a goal they have put a net this year 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.340
 also part usually from the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 left but it also moves around 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.170
 the three quarters of court looking for the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.630
 rival area two different players two 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.759
 players to keep in mind and to 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.860
 that fantasy can take advantage 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.830
 of the team of jürgen klopp has 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.470
 lewandowski to Polish 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.590
 is a type forward saving the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.570
 distances mario gómez typical 9 like 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 I usually say the old one that you fix 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.670
 Central is that it is powerful that goes well 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.950
 of head so these are the dangers 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.190
 Borussia eye ball plays 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.990
 stopped and eye with giving a lot of space to 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.990
 götze and vice versa
