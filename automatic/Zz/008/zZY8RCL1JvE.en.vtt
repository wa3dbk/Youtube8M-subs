that a constant incoming flow rate fills
the<00:00:32.279> pond<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> hydraulic

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the pond what would be the hydraulic

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.889 
the pond what would be the hydraulic
loading<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.940> pond<00:00:36.210> system

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
loading on this pond system

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
loading on this pond system
well<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.500> always<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:38.010> want<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> pull<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.550> our

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
well like always we want to pull out our

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
well like always we want to pull out our
known<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> our<00:00:39.270> unknown<00:00:39.690> information<00:00:40.340> they

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
known and our unknown information they

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220 
known and our unknown information they
want<00:00:41.550> us<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> find<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> hydraulic<00:00:42.719> loading<00:00:42.989> on

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
want us to find the hydraulic loading on

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
want us to find the hydraulic loading on
this<00:00:43.410> pond<00:00:43.649> system

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
this pond system

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
this pond system
well<00:00:44.670> hydraulic<00:00:45.149> loading<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.690> ponds<00:00:46.200> has<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
well hydraulic loading for ponds has the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.670 
well hydraulic loading for ponds has the
units<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.730> inches<00:00:48.270> per<00:00:48.539> day<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.050> inches<00:00:49.469> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
units of inches per day or inches of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.729 
units of inches per day or inches of
rise<00:00:49.920> per<00:00:50.820> day<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.120> hydraulic<00:00:51.840> loading<00:00:52.079> inches

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
rise per day so hydraulic loading inches

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.490 
rise per day so hydraulic loading inches
per<00:00:52.980> day<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.910> tell<00:00:54.180> us<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.840> took<00:00:55.050> 35

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
per day they tell us that it took 35

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
per day they tell us that it took 35
days<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.699> bring<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> its<00:00:57.270> operational

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
days to bring it to its operational

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.459 
days to bring it to its operational
depth<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:59.309> our<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> problem<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.600> 35

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
depth so our time for this problem is 35

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.429 
depth so our time for this problem is 35
days<00:01:01.820> they<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:02.969> tell<00:01:03.329> us<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.229> at

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
days they also tell us that it was at

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
days they also tell us that it was at
has<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> depth<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.280> 3.5<00:01:06.000> feet<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
has a depth of 3.5 feet so the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.469 
has a depth of 3.5 feet so the
operational<00:01:07.229> depth<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.740> 3.5<00:01:08.490> feet<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.390> we

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
operational depth is 3.5 feet so we

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.500 
operational depth is 3.5 feet so we
write<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.150> when<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:12.299> dealing

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
write that down and when you're dealing

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.190 
write that down and when you're dealing
with<00:01:13.010> inches<00:01:14.010> per<00:01:14.310> day<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> obviously

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
with inches per day we want to obviously

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
with inches per day we want to obviously
convert<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.950> three<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> half<00:01:17.490> feet<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
convert our three and a half feet to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.890 
convert our three and a half feet to
inches<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.200> by<00:01:19.350> multiplying<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.159> 3.5<00:01:21.060> times

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
inches so by multiplying the 3.5 times

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.300 
inches so by multiplying the 3.5 times
12<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:23.100> 42<00:01:23.520> inches<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.990> 35<00:01:25.530> days<00:01:25.830> we

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
12 you get 42 inches so in 35 days we

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.910 
12 you get 42 inches so in 35 days we
came<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> an<00:01:26.939> operational<00:01:27.600> level<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.140> 42

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
came up to an operational level of 42

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
came up to an operational level of 42
inches<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> pond<00:01:30.570> hydraulic<00:01:31.290> loading

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
inches so the pond hydraulic loading

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.730 
inches so the pond hydraulic loading
formula<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.880> follows<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:34.110> inches<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
formula is as follows your inches of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.609 
formula is as follows your inches of
rise<00:01:34.950> divided<00:01:35.640> by<00:01:35.820> days<00:01:36.630> required<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
rise divided by days required for the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.740 
rise divided by days required for the
rise<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.970> we've<00:01:39.240> pulled<00:01:39.479> all<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
rise so now that we've pulled all the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.899 
rise so now that we've pulled all the
information<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.799> calculated<00:01:41.430> our<00:01:41.549> total

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
information out and calculated our total

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.539 
information out and calculated our total
inches<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> pond<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.500> simply<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
inches in the pond we simply take the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.870 
inches in the pond we simply take the
inches<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.299> rise<00:01:45.479> which<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.020> 42<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.490> divide

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
inches of rise which is 42 and we divide

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270 
inches of rise which is 42 and we divide
it<00:01:48.060> by<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:48.630> long<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.079> took<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it by how long it took to get that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.560 
it by how long it took to get that
increase<00:01:51.270> 35<00:01:52.229> days<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.579> divide<00:01:53.909> 42

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
increase 35 days so when we divide 42

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
increase 35 days so when we divide 42
inches<00:01:54.990> by<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> 35<00:01:56.070> days<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:57.299> find<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:58.439> our

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
inches by the 35 days we find that our

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
inches by the 35 days we find that our
answer<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.950> 1<00:01:59.340> point<00:01:59.700> 2<00:01:59.969> inches<00:02:00.780> per<00:02:01.079> day<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
answer is 1 point 2 inches per day and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.249 
answer is 1 point 2 inches per day and
that<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:02.340> friend<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.850> how<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.570> problem<00:02:04.079> is

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that my friend is how this problem is

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:16.240 
that my friend is how this problem is
solved

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
