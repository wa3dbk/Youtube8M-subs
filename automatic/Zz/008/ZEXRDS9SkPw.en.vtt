00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.590
 All the time we talked about transforming into 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.170
 transform this world and improve 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 something something in this world for generations 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
 future 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 and this everything as I have always said 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.240
 for you hit the education front 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.550
 and when will we observe education at omd 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 that knowledge is transmitted 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 in those physical spaces that we know 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.969
 like schools 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.829
 we all go through them only with 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.309
 sadness we observe how schools 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.559
 buildings that are obsolete will be under 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.530
 full of toxins 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.480
 teachers demotivated students 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.949
 disinterested today no longer exists 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 respect for nothing 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.379
 the famous parent- teacher associations 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 today there is almost neither the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 support and encouragement from parents for this 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.790
 I already had a teacher phase and I'm tired 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.030
 to hold parent-teacher conferences where 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 we were teachers and a minority of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.920
 peace 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.189
 this all made with that added to other 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.229
 so many problems due to lack of resources 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.560
 schools to become what they are 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.100
 today the environments completely 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 poorly placed unhealthy 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.869
 pass the knowledge as the student 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.140
 will learn something by studying a 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.150
 room that is 40 degrees inside the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 classroom without the fan without 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.299
 chairs a balanced then 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.399
 always have to have the enlightened ones 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.520
 always play with you have to have the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.140
 illuminated a group of illuminated 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 thinkers belonging to organizations 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 how green building formed in the states 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.579
 united a center for green schools without 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 take a break at schoorl 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.049
 there are several actions 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.960
 happening all over the world 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.140
 We here in Brazil engage us. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.680
 Let's pamper ourselves and do two actions. 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.990
 important ones already last year and this year 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.819
 involving companies so that we can 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.520
 do something for these schools 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.239
 any improvement any small 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.530
 thing that you can do the function of 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.190
 this center was to produce're like 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.319
 it was a prescription to produce 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.280
 foundations for how the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.160
 teachers the managers of these schools 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.100
 could pass on this knowledge and are 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.900
 three main pillars you first 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.600
 have to have a sustainable school 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.300
 you have to have a physical building with 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.250
 good school supplies and jada using 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.739
 energy efficiency by taking care of your 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.290
 water and do not be sad here in 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.580
 Brazil we already have two schools one on the river 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 january one in sÃ£o paulo in 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.080
 Brazil then this awareness 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.150
 is already occurring 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.000
 otherwise it solved the space 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.480
 physique- free environment 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.100
 healthy so that knowledge is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.880
 conveyed that you will do number 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.430
 the stimulus to behavioral change 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.070
 through event promotion and 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.320
 sustainable practices within the school 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.489
 you involve the student the teacher 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.260
 worker 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.690
 all who are involved in that 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.030
 environment and this is a snowball 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.320
 The student is going to take him home. 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.510
 pass this to the parents and the 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.130
 family that is going to spend 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.000
 to the community to the neighbors and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.160
 everything else 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 workers involved in school 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.180
 also with this we make a great 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.709
 jail 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.220
 let's use the famous three erres 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.470
 reuse recycle reduce and I studied 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.150
 books of my brothers and then the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.790
 my children every year that went from 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.489
 find new books because that 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.530
 they are adaptable 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.459
 but the main concept it does not change 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.320
 It does not change then we parents have to 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.230
 get involved in our children's school 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.720
 and we make and promote this change 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.840
 our goal is bigger 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.930
 improvement of these indicators. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.690
 sustainability in the communities is 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.410
 with which this chain increases and you are 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.300
 heard 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.360
 you have to listen to your voice, it has to be 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.610
 heard by politicians 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.880
 our cities because the goal is that the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.580
 education this education with the 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.560
 sustainability fundamentals it has 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.530
 incorporated into projects 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.170
 pedagogical policies of municipalities and 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.040
 of governments 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:52.470
 this is the only way we can change and 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.620
 transforming future generations is 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.340
 through education if you like this 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.800
 idea 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.960
 join us try to get interested 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.420
 more on this subject come and help us 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.900
 to transform our relations 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.900
 future
