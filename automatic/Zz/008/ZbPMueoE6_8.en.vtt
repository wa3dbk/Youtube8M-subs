this
and<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.860> come<00:01:33.100> back<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.520> little<00:01:33.790> one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
and you come back to the little one

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.910 

and<00:01:44.470> in<00:01:44.770> slight<00:01:45.100> index<00:01:45.580> one<00:01:45.760> over<00:01:45.940> here

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.270 

you

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.960 

and<00:01:51.820> then<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.060> last<00:01:52.270> quarters<00:01:52.750> on<00:01:52.930> here

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.670 

so<00:02:00.970> basically<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.720> court<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.170> four<00:02:02.380> cores

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
so basically the court the four cores

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.780 
so basically the court the four cores
are

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.229 

there<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.630> when<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.260> part

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.510 

that<00:02:18.239> part<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:19.380> should<00:02:19.590> end<00:02:19.739> up<00:02:19.920> coming<00:02:20.310> over

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
that part you should end up coming over

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.839 
that part you should end up coming over
here<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.590> then<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.980> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.640> same

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
here and then it's kind of like the same

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.960 
here and then it's kind of like the same
course<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.500> it's<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.130> backward<00:02:26.640> orders

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
course but then it's and backward orders

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.430 
course but then it's and backward orders
because<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.810> how<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:27.959> plant<00:02:28.350> like

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
because like you know how you plant like

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.870 
because like you know how you plant like
this<00:02:31.940> that's<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.060> regular<00:02:33.239> order<00:02:33.660> but<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:33.989> uh

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
this that's a regular order but then uh

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.120 
this that's a regular order but then uh
instead<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.300> pay<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.569> backwards

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:50.370 

like<00:02:42.130> that<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:44.320> it's<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.770> how<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.010> play

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.630 

and<00:02:51.380> then

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.210 

that's<00:02:57.540> only<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.590> third<00:02:58.770> time<00:02:58.800> when

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
that's only for that the third time when

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.140 
that's only for that the third time when
you're<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.550> go<00:02:59.760> to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.700 

that<00:03:08.150> part<00:03:08.450> now<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.720> pay<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.230> one<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.410> nice
