00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
just going to my deoxy speed go with the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.380 
just going to my deoxy speed go with the
ice<00:01:53.579> beam<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.450> comes<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> genesect<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
ice beam in in comes the genesect and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
ice beam in in comes the genesect and
you<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.960> release<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.799> know

do because I have never really faced

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.850 
do because I have never really faced
that<00:02:09.580> thing<00:02:09.849> so<00:02:10.119> I'm<00:02:10.300> just<00:02:10.509> gonna<00:02:10.660> stay<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.020> lay

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
that thing so I'm just gonna stay in lay

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.740 
that thing so I'm just gonna stay in lay
up<00:02:12.010> some<00:02:12.220> spikes<00:02:12.550> he's<00:02:12.819> gonna<00:02:12.970> use<00:02:13.300> her<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.660> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
up some spikes he's gonna use her in a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.440 
up some spikes he's gonna use her in a
way<00:02:13.930> kind<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.010> thing<00:02:15.160> he<00:02:15.340> might<00:02:15.489> be<00:02:15.760> scarfed

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
way kind of thing he might be scarfed

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.089 
way kind of thing he might be scarfed
although<00:02:17.110> I'm<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.349> really<00:02:17.410> sure<00:02:17.769> if<00:02:17.950> he's

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
although I'm not really sure if he's

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.040 
although I'm not really sure if he's
gonna<00:02:18.250> be<00:02:18.459> faster<00:02:18.910> than<00:02:19.030> deoxys<00:02:19.540> speed<00:02:19.840> off

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
gonna be faster than deoxys speed off

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.059 
gonna be faster than deoxys speed off
the<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.090> boost<00:02:22.569> by<00:02:22.720> scarf<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.500> anyways<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
the the boost by scarf but anyways I

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.979 
the the boost by scarf but anyways I
digress<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.849> comes<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.180> dragon<00:02:25.360> eyes<00:02:25.630> again

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
digress in comes the dragon eyes again

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.440 
digress in comes the dragon eyes again
and<00:02:26.280> extreme<00:02:27.280> speed<00:02:27.519> here<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.970> pretty<00:02:28.269> obvious

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
and extreme speed here is pretty obvious

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.570 
and extreme speed here is pretty obvious
so<00:02:28.750> I'm<00:02:29.140> pretty<00:02:29.260> sure<00:02:29.860> he's<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.099> gonna<00:02:30.370> go

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
so I'm pretty sure he's just gonna go

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460 
so I'm pretty sure he's just gonna go
for<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.120> I'm<00:02:31.239> going<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.390> switch<00:02:31.599> out<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.170> go

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
for it so I'm going to switch out and go

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.340 
for it so I'm going to switch out and go
into<00:02:32.680> my<00:02:32.860> spirit<00:02:33.220> room<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:34.330> absorb<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.140> head

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
into my spirit room to absorb the head

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.449 
into my spirit room to absorb the head
and<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.310> exactly<00:02:36.549> what<00:02:37.000> he<00:02:37.180> does<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:39.100> at

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
and that is exactly what he does so at

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.220 
and that is exactly what he does so at
least<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.940> predicted<00:02:40.269> something<00:02:40.750> right<00:02:40.959> here

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
least I predicted something right here

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.460 
least I predicted something right here
so<00:02:41.890> uh<00:02:41.920> I'm<00:02:42.700> gonna<00:02:42.850> just<00:02:42.970> go<00:02:43.299> with<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.690> Shadow

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
so uh I'm gonna just go with the Shadow

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.280 
so uh I'm gonna just go with the Shadow
Ball<00:02:44.709> cuz<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.190> know<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:45.489> pretty<00:02:45.670> much<00:02:45.790> my

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
Ball cuz you know that's pretty much my

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.600 
Ball cuz you know that's pretty much my
best<00:02:47.290> option<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.920> he's<00:02:48.069> gonna<00:02:48.190> go<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.489> his

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
best option but he's gonna go in his

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.830 
best option but he's gonna go in his
bronzong<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.549> pretty<00:02:51.549> much<00:02:51.670> spawns<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.660> head

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
bronzong and pretty much spawns the head

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.740 
bronzong and pretty much spawns the head
really<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.819> don't<00:02:55.269> really<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.480> any

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
really well but I don't really have any

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.660 
really well but I don't really have any
better<00:02:56.110> options<00:02:56.620> against<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.130> thing<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.549> I'm

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
better options against this thing so I'm

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.580 
better options against this thing so I'm
just<00:02:57.790> gonna<00:02:57.940> stay<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.209> and<00:02:58.540> try<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.319> rack<00:02:59.560> up

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
just gonna stay in and try to rack up

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.920 
just gonna stay in and try to rack up
the<00:02:59.860> damage<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:01.030> best<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.480> but<00:03:01.870> you

chance to set up his cell frogs which is
you<00:03:08.140> know<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.739> doesn't<00:03:08.980> really<00:03:09.070> hinder<00:03:09.280> my

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579

it's it has pretty much already served
his<00:03:21.569> purpose<00:03:22.569> by<00:03:22.810> pretty<00:03:23.500> much<00:03:23.650> breaking

his purpose by pretty much breaking
holes<00:03:24.940> through<00:03:25.660> my<00:03:25.840> team<00:03:26.140> taking<00:03:26.709> out<00:03:26.859> two<00:03:27.160> of

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
holes through my team taking out two of

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.090 
holes through my team taking out two of
my<00:03:27.760> guys<00:03:27.940> already<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.139> now<00:03:29.410> he's<00:03:29.590> also<00:03:29.769> going

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
my guys already so now he's also going

my guys already so now he's also going
to<00:03:30.190> get<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.400> say<00:03:30.609> switch<00:03:30.850> into<00:03:31.180> his<00:03:31.389> weight

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
because it's pretty random so he

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.510 
because it's pretty random so he
actually<00:06:07.270> we<00:06:07.390> did<00:06:07.630> have<00:06:07.930> a<00:06:07.960> rematch<00:06:08.560> where
