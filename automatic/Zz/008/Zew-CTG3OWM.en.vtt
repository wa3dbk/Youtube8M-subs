 hello everyone welcome to the first video 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 of this channel I will use loquendo for reasons 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 of time I promise you that in the next 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.739
 video will already appreciate my voice as such 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 in this video we will talk about a controversy 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.470
 emerged in marvel comics the death of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.710
 The pool is mainly fundamental 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.659
 clarify comes from actor bud and wilson was 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 an international murderer who had 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.640
 worked for several governments when 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.100
 developed an aggressive cancer in a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.860
 effort to find a cure joined 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.320
 to the program called the weapon x which is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.600
 developed in Canada what gave it a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.180
 healing factor originally from 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.159
 wolverine after this he got to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 work for them as a killer to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 an involuntary massacre until the in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 a desperate action to killed a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 member of the team was expelled from 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 program and was sent to be eliminated 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.479
 because of their high risk of skills and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 knowledge that he got but before 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.200
 that took him to a place where he 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.329
 experimented with him and his factor of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 mutant healing that was granted by 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.540
 the program 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 the results of his stay had 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.440
 left an instrumental a bit 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 decreased and a healing factor that 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.690
 He could not fix his cancer or cure his 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 scars then gra and it was decided 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.280
 work as elmer with lake that which 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 he had been left with the nickname for his 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 high sense of humor heavy album 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.149
 light and comedy for the moment 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.640
 to dislike him that name he called himself 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.590
 as of current so to work killing 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.330
 as the mercenary himself under his 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 own rules and have a good time 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.009
 doing it after several 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.050
 events was requested by nick 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.840
 fury to be recruited asier de 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.580
 work for them he accepted under his 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.350
 own conditions and started to work 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.739
 for them and settled in him 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.170
 helitransport the sky this character 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.989
 was created by the artist oak the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.730
 Fabian writer and party made his first 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.890
 appearance in the pages of the new 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.720
 many February 98 , 1991 commonly 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.220
 he is always found in an environment 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.040
 violent not moderate but already 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.590
 characteristic of said character 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.780
 already returning to the main theme to this 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.319
 character is seen to die very often and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.209
 almost always but it is always regenerated 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.609
 for its healing factor which 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.469
 It means that you can never die but more 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.019
 he took this very seriously this has already 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:59.069
 announced his final death this we 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.300
 leave a question because then this is 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.850
 raises for the guilty franchise photos 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.640
 This has three common aspects 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.220
 which are wolverine 'and x-men the four 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.140
 fantastic and that's why they are 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.880
 cinematographic and rights 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.950
 knowing that the income of the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.200
 next movies after the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.540
 four fantastic will go to the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.970
 marvel fox pockets has decided 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.060
 cut all kinds of promotion from the already 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.860
 mentioned franchises this had already been 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.740
 hinted at with the announcement that the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.710
 Franchise of the 'Fantastic Four' 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.750
 would find its end in 2015 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.330
 in summary marvel does not have any 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.280
 interest in promoting characters whose 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.740
 adaptations do not leave you revenue 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.050
 economic and has already entered the subject 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.730
 as a curious fact the same Wilson of the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.770
 first film and balvorÃ­n to 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.050
 played by Ryan Reynolds too 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.200
 will interpret it as current for 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.770
 the expected next movie what do you 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.140
 it seems all this you think that marvel has 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.090
 some play to recover all his 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.420
 rights that he lived when almost the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.989
 bankruptcy will return to our mercenary 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.660
 loudmouth to the comics leave your answer 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.630
