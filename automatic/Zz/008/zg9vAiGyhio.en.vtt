00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
matter like Oh what I grind on it just

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.910 
matter like Oh what I grind on it just
like<00:00:35.710> works<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.219> well<00:00:37.659> like<00:00:38.659> there's<00:00:38.989> nowhere

like works so well like there's nowhere
at<00:00:40.339> all<00:00:40.370> anywhere<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.480> just<00:00:42.339> doesn't<00:00:43.339> get

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
at all anywhere it just doesn't get

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.520 
at all anywhere it just doesn't get
damaged<00:00:44.059> at<00:00:44.149> all<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:44.690> there's<00:00:44.960> extreme

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
damaged at all so there's extreme

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.110 
damaged at all so there's extreme
quality<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> deck<00:00:47.019> deck<00:00:48.789> you<00:00:49.789> can<00:00:49.969> only

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
quality on the deck deck you can only

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.380 
quality on the deck deck you can only
get<00:00:50.420> um<00:00:50.859> exotic<00:00:51.859> wood<00:00:52.249> with<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:52.640> HC<00:00:53.179> mode

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
get um exotic wood with the HC mode

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.139 
get um exotic wood with the HC mode
which<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.409> really<00:00:54.829> don't<00:00:55.010> care<00:00:55.069> because<00:00:55.429> HC

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
which I really don't care because HC

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.869 
which I really don't care because HC
mold<00:00:56.390> is<00:00:56.539> actually<00:00:56.929> better<00:00:57.199> in<00:00:57.559> my<00:00:58.309> preference

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
mold is actually better in my preference

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.989 
mold is actually better in my preference
than<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.269> JK<00:00:59.690> mold<00:01:00.170> because<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:01.460> kicks<00:01:01.789> are

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
than the JK mold because the kicks are

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.170 
than the JK mold because the kicks are
higher<00:01:02.210> up<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.899> it<00:01:03.170> makes<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:03.589> easier<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.180> do

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
higher up so it makes it easier to do

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
higher up so it makes it easier to do
any<00:01:05.390> kind<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.750> tricks<00:01:06.549> and<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.360> nose<00:01:08.630> is

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
any kind of tricks and the nose is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.840 
any kind of tricks and the nose is
higher<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.920> longer<00:01:11.530> noses<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:13.159> right<00:01:13.610> here

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
higher and longer noses this right here

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.529 
higher and longer noses this right here
system<00:01:14.810> knows<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:16.490> little<00:01:16.880> bit<00:01:17.000> higher<00:01:17.240> up

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
system knows it's a little bit higher up

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.190 
system knows it's a little bit higher up
and<00:01:17.810> longer<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:18.860> it's<00:01:19.479> since<00:01:20.479> it's<00:01:20.719> longer

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
and longer but it's since it's longer

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.310 
and longer but it's since it's longer
it's<00:01:21.439> kind<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.860> like<00:01:22.960> less<00:01:24.880> less<00:01:25.880> steep<00:01:26.320> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's kind of like less less steep the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.950 
it's kind of like less less steep the
tail<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.640> little<00:01:28.909> bit<00:01:29.030> steeper<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.439> that's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
tail and a little bit steeper so that's

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.749 
tail and a little bit steeper so that's
I<00:01:32.960> guess<00:01:33.229> it's<00:01:33.469> better<00:01:33.740> something<00:01:34.640> Matt<00:01:34.729> er

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
I guess it's better something Matt er

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.929 
I guess it's better something Matt er
but<00:01:35.420> for<00:01:35.600> me<00:01:35.750> since<00:01:36.140> i<00:01:36.500> started<00:01:37.100> off<00:01:37.340> when<00:01:37.820> i'll

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
but for me since i started off when i'll

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.969 
but for me since i started off when i'll
using<00:01:38.299> tech<00:01:38.509> decks<00:01:38.750> since<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.170> skate<00:01:39.469> regular

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
using tech decks since I skate regular

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.890 
using tech decks since I skate regular
and<00:01:40.729> I'm<00:01:40.850> left-handed<00:01:42.039> um

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
and I'm left-handed um

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.770 
and I'm left-handed um
I<00:01:47.890> just<00:01:48.890> did<00:01:49.100> nollie<00:01:49.400> so<00:01:49.820> basically<00:01:50.390> right<00:01:50.630> now

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
I just did nollie so basically right now

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.380 
I just did nollie so basically right now
I'm<00:01:50.960> better'n<00:01:51.320> nollie<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.890> switch<00:01:52.190> so<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.210> have

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
I'm better'n nollie and switch so I have

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.830 
I'm better'n nollie and switch so I have
to<00:01:53.510> use<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.690> nose<00:01:54.080> as<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.620> tail<00:01:55.150> but<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.390> guess

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to use the nose as the tail but I guess

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.800 
to use the nose as the tail but I guess
I<00:01:57.290> don't<00:01:57.740> know<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.610> just<00:01:58.730> me<00:01:59.090> something

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
I don't know that's just me something

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.200 
I don't know that's just me something
wrong<00:02:00.020> with<00:02:00.230> me<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.380> guess<00:02:00.850> there's<00:02:01.850> something

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
wrong with me I guess there's something

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.080 
wrong with me I guess there's something
wrong<00:02:02.330> with<00:02:02.570> everybody<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.310> whatever<00:02:04.780> but<00:02:05.780> um

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
wrong with everybody so whatever but um

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.460 
wrong with everybody so whatever but um
so<00:02:08.090> yeah<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.600> trucks<00:02:09.020> are<00:02:09.440> gold<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:11.470> they've

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
so yeah the trucks are gold and they've

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.360 
so yeah the trucks are gold and they've
lasted<00:02:12.800> forever<00:02:13.250> they<00:02:14.090> don't<00:02:14.270> grind<00:02:14.510> off<00:02:14.780> i

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
lasted forever they don't grind off i

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
lasted forever they don't grind off i
guess<00:02:16.370> i<00:02:16.550> would<00:02:16.610> get<00:02:17.480> chewed<00:02:17.810> up<00:02:17.990> if<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.410> use

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
guess i would get chewed up if you use

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.610 
guess i would get chewed up if you use
like<00:02:19.390> some<00:02:20.390> messed-up<00:02:20.690> surface<00:02:21.440> that's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
like some messed-up surface that's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.490 
like some messed-up surface that's
really<00:02:21.950> bad<00:02:22.130> but<00:02:22.430> i<00:02:22.730> chose<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.660> take<00:02:23.840> sandpaper

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
really bad but i chose to take sandpaper

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.130 
really bad but i chose to take sandpaper
and<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:26.780> down<00:02:27.140> any<00:02:27.590> like<00:02:28.900> obstacle<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and like what down any like obstacle the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.290 
and like what down any like obstacle the
corner<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> obstacle<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.370> then<00:02:32.030> just

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
corner of the obstacle and then just

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:42.640 
corner of the obstacle and then just
stand<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:32.840> crazy<00:02:33.320> on<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:39.640> now<00:02:40.640> i<00:02:41.380> do<00:02:42.380> that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
stand like crazy on it and now i do that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.140 
stand like crazy on it and now i do that
to<00:02:42.770> every<00:02:43.010> obstacle<00:02:43.310> ass<00:02:43.610> kicked<00:02:43.970> by<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
to every obstacle ass kicked by a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.550 
to every obstacle ass kicked by a
fingerboard<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.760> that's<00:02:46.760> probably<00:02:47.000> why

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
fingerboard with and that's probably why

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.320 
fingerboard with and that's probably why
the<00:02:48.560> trucks<00:02:48.890> aren't<00:02:49.130> super<00:02:49.610> good<00:02:49.790> condition

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
the trucks aren't super good condition

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.660 
the trucks aren't super good condition
so<00:02:50.360> if<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.440> want<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.650> save<00:02:51.890> your<00:02:51.920> truck's<00:02:52.310> keep

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
so if you want to save your truck's keep

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.540 
so if you want to save your truck's keep

should buy those cheap little 99-cent
candles<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.820> then<00:03:02.209> like<00:03:02.860> just<00:03:03.860> wax<00:03:04.100> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310

corner and then put it in the freezer

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.610 
corner and then put it in the freezer
and<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:07.070> works<00:03:07.340> like<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.720> wax<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.110> basically

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
and it works like the wax is basically

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.320 
and it works like the wax is basically
like<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:10.070> there<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.940> kind<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.209> like

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
like on there and it's kind of like

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.430 
like on there and it's kind of like
lacquered<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.080> little<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:17.000> won't<00:03:17.440> scrape

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
lacquered a little and it won't scrape

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.240 
lacquered a little and it won't scrape
up<00:03:18.680> anything<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.019> deck<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> gave<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.800> 10<00:03:22.130> out

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.770 
of 10 and on the trucks a 9 out of 10
because<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.300> quality<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:27.110> little<00:03:27.440> bad

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780

are box shape there's a difference and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.830 
are box shape there's a difference and
skate<00:05:05.270> wheels<00:05:05.539> there's<00:05:06.669> sgf<00:05:07.669> box<00:05:08.180> cut<00:05:08.570> wheels

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
which and then there's the normal ones

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.510 
which and then there's the normal ones
which<00:05:12.050> are<00:05:12.260> curved<00:05:12.680> off<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.280> have<00:05:13.460> less<00:05:15.520> less

substance<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.600> be<00:05:17.750> rolling<00:05:18.110> on<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.350> ground<00:05:18.789> so

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
substance to be rolling on the ground so

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.740 
substance to be rolling on the ground so
box<00:05:20.210> boxy<00:05:20.870> wheels<00:05:21.080> are<00:05:21.350> kind<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.650> are<00:05:21.860> smoother

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
box boxy wheels are kind of are smoother

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.900 
box boxy wheels are kind of are smoother
because<00:05:23.750> they<00:05:24.229> have<00:05:24.380> more<00:05:24.590> substance<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.460> on

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
because they have more substance and on

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.360 
because they have more substance and on
the<00:05:26.510> ground<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:28.120> they<00:05:30.039> they<00:05:31.039> don't<00:05:31.160> move

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the ground and they they don't move

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.219 
the ground and they they don't move
