00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.680
 here in this video I present you 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.700
 well a really the seven circles 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.940
 harmonics for the guitar that we can 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.870
 know here 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.640
 for two 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:25.810
 we're going to have 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.500
 the first chord is going to be higher the lower 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.000
 re minor 'and alone 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.670
 for the network circle 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.820
 we are going to have the network 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.820
 yes minor and minor and the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.610
 for me 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.020
 we're going to have 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 to the tone of my as main 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.250
 C sharp minor 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.199
 then for sustained minor and if 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.199
 we continue with fa 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.800
 we go to who we have to fa 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.620
 the king held lower 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.040
 a minor sun caught 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.250
 and we continue to come back in a circle 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 that's why they call it circles 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.369
 for sun we will have sun and my minor 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 the youngest and re and then we return to sun 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.009
 again in circle truth 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.540
 like the snakes that bite the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.540
 tail shape circle 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.790
 we started with the go to false sharp 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.350
 minor and so I 'll do it myself too I want 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.350
 take advantage also to give them the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:52.649
 the chords of the basses and in this case 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.649
 for the primary bass we are going to have this way 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.100
 the secondary bass is going to be sustained 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.770
 and under primary is going to be two jobs 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.290
 school is going to be sun primary work 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.500
 it's going to be sun and the secondary bass goes to 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.500
 be 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.470
 we lack the primary bass 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.930
 when it is fa 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.930
 the secondary bass is do 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.460
 when the primary vago 2000 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.460
 the secondary bass is 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.380
 when the primary bass is the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.380
 the secondary bass is 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 m 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.460
 and finally when the primary bass is 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.460
 the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.670
 the secondary bass is the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.110
 very well 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.640
 good 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.960
 but in the next video we're going to 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.069
 start practicing the chords 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.360
 starting with do 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.890
 I was missing the circle of yes true 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.569
 what are we going to do yes 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.520
 sun sustained minor do sharp minor 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.230
 forgiveness and sustained fa 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.570
 then summarizing the tones 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.560
 principals will be according to the 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:24.040
 notes of our scale do do re 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 me 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.760
 and yes 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.670
 true 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.770
 so here we include everything 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:43.319
 circles and chords dot 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.060
 for the primary and secondary basses 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.799
 in the next video we're going to start 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.799
 with the agreed finger
