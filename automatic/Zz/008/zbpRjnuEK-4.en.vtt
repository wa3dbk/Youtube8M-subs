00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
you'll see that your model has two flaps

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.900 
you'll see that your model has two flaps
here<00:00:05.120> and<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:07.309> we<00:00:08.309> need<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.490> get<00:00:08.670> rid<00:00:08.880> of

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
here and here we need to get rid of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.379 
here and here we need to get rid of
these<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:10.230> do<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.639> we're<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> open<00:00:12.150> up

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
these to do so we're going to open up

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.839 
these to do so we're going to open up
one<00:00:12.900> flap<00:00:13.230> with<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> model<00:00:13.860> again<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.700> like

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
one flap with the model again just like

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.900 
one flap with the model again just like
that<00:00:15.260> but<00:00:16.260> instead<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.830> reverse<00:00:17.460> fold<00:00:17.760> here

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
that but instead of reverse fold here

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.300 
that but instead of reverse fold here
going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> fold<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> flap<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:22.100> it<00:00:23.100> goes

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
going to fold this flap so that it goes

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.970 
going to fold this flap so that it goes
inside<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.500> if<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.590> didn't<00:00:25.800> catch<00:00:25.920> that

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
inside of here if you didn't catch that

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.609 
inside of here if you didn't catch that
are<00:00:26.400> dirt<00:00:26.580> again<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:27.170> we're<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.439> open

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
are dirt again here we're going to open

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.120 
are dirt again here we're going to open
up<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:31.080> model<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.460> remember<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.630> flap

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
up the model like so remember this flap

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.430 
up the model like so remember this flap
going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> slowly<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:37.430> side<00:00:39.290> of<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
going to slowly put it in side of the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.830 
going to slowly put it in side of the
open<00:00:40.800> model<00:00:44.059> your<00:00:45.059> model<00:00:45.360> should<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.690> look

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
open model your model should now look

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.240 
open model your model should now look
like<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.550> okay<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.610> far<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.059> good

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
like this okay so far so good

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.619 
like this okay so far so good
unfortunately<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> next<00:00:50.730> step<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> turn

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
unfortunately the next step is to turn

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.160 
unfortunately the next step is to turn
the<00:00:51.750> model<00:00:51.899> around<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.510> do<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> what

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the model around and do all of what

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
the model around and do all of what
we've<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.320> done<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.160> side<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
we've just done on the other side so

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
we've just done on the other side so
that's<00:00:57.719> starting<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.620> opening<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> flaps

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that's starting from opening the flaps

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.470 
that's starting from opening the flaps
out<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.629> fingers<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.359> squashing<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
out with your fingers and squashing it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.640 
out with your fingers and squashing it
and<00:01:04.610> all<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.090> turn<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> statue<00:01:07.320> just

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and all the way turn the statue just

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.460 
and all the way turn the statue just
done<00:01:11.119> now<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.330> we've<00:01:12.450> done<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.810> steps<00:01:13.170> on

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
done now that we've done these steps on

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.620 
done now that we've done these steps on
both<00:01:13.770> sides<00:01:14.100> we're<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> unfold<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
both sides we're going to unfold the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
both sides we're going to unfold the
model<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.080> I've<00:01:19.290> outlined<00:01:19.860> these

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
model as you can see I've outlined these

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.810 
model as you can see I've outlined these
three<00:01:20.729> creases<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.479> black<00:01:21.960> pen<00:01:22.670> this<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
three creases in black pen this is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
three creases in black pen this is
because<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.840> will<00:01:24.990> make<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.650> lot<00:01:26.549> easier

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
because this will make it a lot easier

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.469 
because this will make it a lot easier
for<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> next<00:01:27.509> step<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:31.130> along<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.880> edge<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
for the next step for along one edge of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.210 
for the next step for along one edge of
the<00:01:33.570> diagonal<00:01:34.049> crease<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.320> then<00:01:37.320> fold

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the diagonal crease like so then fold

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.910 
the diagonal crease like so then fold
along<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:39.329> horizontal<00:01:39.600> crease<00:01:40.970> like<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
along this horizontal crease like so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.480 
along this horizontal crease like so
this<00:01:43.920> should<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:45.500> an<00:01:46.500> almost<00:01:46.890> heart<00:01:47.159> shape

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this should make an almost heart shape

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.380 
this should make an almost heart shape
to<00:01:48.090> complete<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.659> fold<00:01:49.409> along<00:01:49.590> again<00:01:50.100> this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
to complete this fold along again this

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
to complete this fold along again this
diagonal<00:01:51.390> line<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.950> now<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
diagonal line like so now I'm going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.450 
diagonal line like so now I'm going to
turn<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> model<00:01:56.969> around<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.979> an<00:01:58.979> almost

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
turn the model around and do an almost

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.929 
turn the model around and do an almost
identical<00:01:59.640> our<00:02:00.509> fault<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> open<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
identical our fault going to open up the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.029 
identical our fault going to open up the
model<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:04.770> purchase<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.799> same

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
model and to purchase it in the same

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.180 
model and to purchase it in the same
thing<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.819> different<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.890> your<00:02:10.890> model

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
thing just in different way your model

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100 
thing just in different way your model
should<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:11.520> look<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.970> heart<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.780> very

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
should now look like a heart and is very

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.730 
should now look like a heart and is very
nearly

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
nearly

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.000 
nearly
eat<00:02:14.120> all<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.360> remains<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.350> open<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
eat all that remains is to open the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.380 
eat all that remains is to open the
model<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.600> you'll<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.470> bit<00:02:19.800> and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
model up you'll see that this bit and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.010 
model up you'll see that this bit and
this<00:02:21.390> bit<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:22.140> two<00:02:22.380> flaps<00:02:23.660> what<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.780> need<00:02:24.930> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
this bit for two flaps what we need to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
this bit for two flaps what we need to
do<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.680> take<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.670> flap<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.560> put<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
do is take one flap and put it so that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.860 
do is take one flap and put it so that
it<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.300> top<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.540> these<00:02:30.870> two<00:02:31.170> layers<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:32.250> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
it is on top of these two layers like so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.500 
it is on top of these two layers like so
then<00:02:33.870> turn<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> model<00:02:34.410> around<00:02:35.390> take<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
then turn the model around take the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.530 
then turn the model around take the
other<00:02:36.540> flap<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.980> put<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.340> top<00:02:38.550> these<00:02:39.120> two

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
other flap and put it on top these two

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.490 
other flap and put it on top these two
sides<00:02:39.840> again<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:44.780> can<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:45.990> be<00:02:46.170> squashed

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
sides again like so can not be squashed

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.590 
sides again like so can not be squashed
is<00:02:46.830> now<00:02:47.040> complete<00:02:48.230> our<00:02:49.230> squash<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.520> model<00:02:50.600> by
