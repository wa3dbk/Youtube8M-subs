00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so this one is and as far as how this

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490 
so this one is and as far as how this
mascara<00:00:47.550> works<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.210> think<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.200> really

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
mascara works I think that it's really

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
mascara works I think that it's really
good<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.920> gives<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.460> natural<00:00:50.820> look

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
like really natural and i think that the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.170 
like really natural and i think that the
second<00:00:53.489> coat<00:00:53.699> makes<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> difference<00:00:55.110> um

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
second coat makes all the difference um

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
second coat makes all the difference um
unless<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:58.559> natural

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
unless you like like really natural

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.400 
unless you like like really natural
lashes<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.879> need<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> second<00:01:00.449> coat<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
lashes you do need a second coat it is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
lashes you do need a second coat it is
gel<00:01:01.710> formulated<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:03.180> quite<00:01:03.449> sure

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
gel formulated and I'm not quite sure

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
gel formulated and I'm not quite sure
how<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.930> changes<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> mascara<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.820> don't

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
how that changes the mascara but I don't

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
how that changes the mascara but I don't
know<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.869> pretty<00:01:07.020> cool<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.860> gel

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

kind of in the middle more toward the
wet<00:02:14.849> side<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:16.230> doesn't<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.650> thick<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.069> my

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.580 
wet side it doesn't really thick in my
lashes<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.540> doesn't<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.019> give<00:02:19.260> them<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.190 
lashes and it doesn't really give them a
lot<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.920> volume<00:02:20.250> does<00:02:20.700> lengthen<00:02:21.239> them<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.690> i'm

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200

lashes so um i think that's good for
that<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.310> good<00:02:29.459> layering<00:02:29.760> mascara<00:02:30.360> as

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that it's a good layering mascara as

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.539 
that it's a good layering mascara as
well<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.049> if<00:02:31.200> you're<00:02:31.319> gonna<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.709> maybe<00:02:32.340> your
