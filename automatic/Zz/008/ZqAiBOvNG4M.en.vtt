00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
draws 340 brake horse power by 50

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.430 
draws 340 brake horse power by 50
horsepower<00:00:22.410> engine<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.510> they're<00:00:24.510> extreme<00:00:25.230> in

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
horsepower engine and they're extreme in

the<00:00:25.530> sir

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.940 

but<00:00:35.020> it's<00:00:35.170> not<00:00:35.320> all<00:00:35.440> about<00:00:35.470> speed<00:00:35.920> and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
but it's not all about speed and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.400 
but it's not all about speed and
maneuverability<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.300> thing<00:00:37.930> that<00:00:38.080> gives<00:00:38.230> it

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
maneuverability the thing that gives it

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.530 
maneuverability the thing that gives it
the<00:00:38.440> maneuverability<00:00:39.340> with<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.970> hijackers

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
the maneuverability with the hijackers

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.070 
the maneuverability with the hijackers
it<00:00:40.930> basically<00:00:41.230> gives<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.620> right<00:00:41.860> angle<00:00:43.080> so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
it basically gives it a right angle so

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.350 
it basically gives it a right angle so
that<00:00:44.290> when<00:00:44.470> you're<00:00:44.620> turning<00:00:44.920> you<00:00:45.910> literally

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
that when you're turning you literally

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.840 
that when you're turning you literally
turn<00:00:46.600> on<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.840> six<00:00:47.080> months<00:00:47.440> you'll<00:00:48.430> notice

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
turn on the six months you'll notice

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.720 
turn on the six months you'll notice
that<00:00:49.120> my<00:00:49.660> boats<00:00:50.020> got<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.530> four<00:00:51.010> blade<00:00:51.220> prop<00:00:51.550> on

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
that my boats got a four blade prop on

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.479 
that my boats got a four blade prop on
it<00:00:51.900> which<00:00:52.900> is<00:00:53.080> designed<00:00:53.470> for<00:00:53.800> torque

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
it which is designed for torque

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:02.689 
it which is designed for torque
acceleration<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:56.470> for<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.770> surf

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.929 

oh<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:03.269> god<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.899> never<00:01:04.049> held<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> anything<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
oh my god I never held on to anything so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
oh my god I never held on to anything so
tight<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.479> my<00:01:06.509> home<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.920> speed

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
tight in my home when they do speed

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.730 
tight in my home when they do speed
trials<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:09.060> 120<00:01:09.659> kilometers<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.259> hour<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
trials over 120 kilometers an hour and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
trials over 120 kilometers an hour and
you<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.549> far<00:01:11.820> off<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> water<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
you are that far off the water so you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200 
you are that far off the water so you
think<00:01:13.590> about<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.770> ghost<00:01:14.040> car<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.610> water

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
think about a ghost car on water

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.260 
think about a ghost car on water
this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> go-kart<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.649> water

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.330 

obviously<00:01:21.270> too<00:01:21.540> much<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> massive<00:01:22.590> lad<00:01:22.830> say

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
obviously too much of a massive lad say

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.510 
obviously too much of a massive lad say
stop<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.960> keep<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.350> even<00:01:29.040> faster

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
stop just like keep going even faster

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:51.330 
stop just like keep going even faster
over<00:01:35.840> telephones<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:37.020> though<00:01:37.260> nothing

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:02.020
