receiver<00:00:21.689> right<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.490> vehicle<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910

but it does have the benefit of having

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
but it does have the benefit of having
tier<00:00:28.050> 10<00:00:28.230> heels<00:00:28.500> which<00:00:28.800> means<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.400> it's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
tier 10 heels which means that it's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
people and the reason I kept it within

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.139 
people and the reason I kept it within
t8<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.710> because<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.640> friends<00:00:35.880> who<00:00:35.969> also

maneuverability<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> also<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.729> better<00:01:42.090> for

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
maneuverability and also it's better for

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.460 
maneuverability and also it's better for
driving<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.630> hills<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> should
