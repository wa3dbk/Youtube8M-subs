holder<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:23.359> one<00:00:24.359> holder<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:24.990> top<00:00:25.230> but

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
holder and one holder up on top but

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
holder and one holder up on top but
we're<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> replace<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> bottom<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.759 
we're going to replace the bottom and
the<00:00:27.329> reason<00:00:27.630> being<00:00:27.659> is<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.619> get

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the reason being is because they get

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.150 
the reason being is because they get
dingy<00:00:29.220> looking<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:30.060> get<00:00:30.269> bent<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.160> even

actually<00:00:32.430> start<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> fall<00:00:32.850> apart<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
actually start to fall apart and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.910 
actually start to fall apart and
deteriorate<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.620> gives<00:00:34.680> your

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
