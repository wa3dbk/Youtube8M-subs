into<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.290> spoon<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.799> then<00:03:26.430> slowly<00:03:26.700> erosion<00:03:27.450> cut

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630

grooves into the end and turned it into

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.360 
grooves into the end and turned it into
a<00:03:29.190> fork<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:30.590> knew<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.799> on<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.950> something<00:03:32.100> here

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
a fork I knew I was on to something here

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.810 
a fork I knew I was on to something here
but<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.670> felt<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.060> had<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> missing<00:03:33.600> link

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
but I felt like I had a missing link

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.620 
but I felt like I had a missing link
particularly<00:03:35.820> between<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.269> spoon<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
particularly between the spoon and the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.590 
particularly between the spoon and the
fork<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.130> just<00:03:38.130> couldn't<00:03:38.310> find<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.730> till<00:03:39.450> one

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
fork I just couldn't find it till one

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.750 
fork I just couldn't find it till one
day<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.750> was<00:03:39.930> flying<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.350> Connecticut<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:40.950> usair

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
day I was flying to Connecticut on usair

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.020 
day I was flying to Connecticut on usair
I<00:03:41.970> was<00:03:42.720> 30,000<00:03:43.590> feet<00:03:43.680> off<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.890> ground<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
I was 30,000 feet off the ground and the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.490 
I was 30,000 feet off the ground and the
stewardess<00:03:45.390> walked<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.049> aisle<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
stewardess walked down the aisle and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.390 
stewardess walked down the aisle and
just<00:03:47.010> handed<00:03:47.670> me<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.940> missing<00:03:48.209> link<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:49.400> don't

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
just handed me the missing link I don't

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.180 
just handed me the missing link I don't
think<00:03:50.609> she<00:03:50.790> knew<00:03:50.940> what<00:03:50.970> she<00:03:51.150> had<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.769> my<00:03:52.920> train

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
think she knew what she had but my train

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.039 
think she knew what she had but my train
scientific<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.880> picked<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.390> up<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:54.660> away<00:03:54.780> I

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
scientific I picked it up right away I

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.009 
scientific I picked it up right away I
said<00:03:55.260> wow<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.310> I've<00:03:56.970> got<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.600> stuck

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
said wow this is it I've got it I stuck

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.259 
said wow this is it I've got it I stuck
it<00:03:58.049> in<00:03:58.200> my<00:03:58.230> pocket<00:03:58.519> later<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.640> day<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.000> went<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
it in my pocket later that day I went to

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.979 
it in my pocket later that day I went to
popeyes<00:04:00.420> chicken<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.140> found<00:04:01.380> another<00:04:01.709> one

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
popeyes chicken and found another one

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.449 
popeyes chicken and found another one
there<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.109> are<00:04:04.140> folks<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.769> missing<00:04:05.130> links

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
there they are folks the missing links

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.580 
there they are folks the missing links
so<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.390> evolution<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.840> silverware<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.410> nearly

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
so the evolution of silverware is nearly

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.479 
so the evolution of silverware is nearly
complete<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:10.620> course<00:04:10.799> we<00:04:10.920> got<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.069> few<00:04:11.190> Mouton

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
complete of course we got a few Mouton

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.800 
complete of course we got a few Mouton
mutants<00:04:11.880> along<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.180> way<00:04:12.299> didn't<00:04:12.660> quite

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
mutants along the way didn't quite

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.750 
mutants along the way didn't quite
survive<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.380> some<00:04:13.500> reason<00:04:13.799> you<00:04:13.889> know<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.250> of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
survive for some reason you know and of

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.129 
survive for some reason you know and of
course<00:04:14.970> people<00:04:15.389> found<00:04:15.660> out<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.810> was<00:04:15.989> doing

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
course people found out I was doing

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.479 
course people found out I was doing
research<00:04:16.169> on<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.919> all<00:04:17.010> wanted<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.340> be

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
research on this they all wanted to be

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.949 
research on this they all wanted to be
famous<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.910> know<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.389> they<00:04:18.479> tried<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:18.840> in

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
famous you know so they tried to get in

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.259 
famous you know so they tried to get in
on<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.169> glory<00:04:19.560> they<00:04:20.340> sent<00:04:20.579> me<00:04:20.639> their<00:04:20.850> research

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
on the glory they sent me their research

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.860 
on the glory they sent me their research
this<00:04:22.080> one<00:04:22.289> was<00:04:22.680> an<00:04:22.800> obvious<00:04:23.180> fork<00:04:24.180> head<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:24.840> a

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
this one was an obvious fork head on a

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.910 
this one was an obvious fork head on a
spoon<00:04:25.320> handle<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.979> mean<00:04:26.099> look

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
spoon handle I mean look

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.620 
spoon handle I mean look
it<00:04:27.160> didn't<00:04:27.490> get<00:04:27.580> by<00:04:27.730> me<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> caught<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.420> right

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
it didn't get by me I caught it right

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.300 
it didn't get by me I caught it right
away<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:28.930> know<00:04:29.230> they<00:04:29.470> don't<00:04:29.500> good<00:04:29.890> stuff<00:04:30.130> I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
away you know they don't good stuff I

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.530 
away you know they don't good stuff I
don't<00:04:30.490> get<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.760> don't<00:04:31.000> fall<00:04:31.150> for<00:04:31.300> stuff<00:04:31.450> like

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
don't get I don't fall for stuff like

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.420 
don't get I don't fall for stuff like
that<00:04:31.660> even<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.470> races<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.800> course<00:04:33.010> evolved

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
that even the races of course evolved

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.580 
that even the races of course evolved
over<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.700> long<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.000> ways<00:04:34.120> but<00:04:34.380> look<00:04:35.380> if<00:04:35.500> you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
over the long the ways but look if you

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.690 
over the long the ways but look if you
want<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.800> arrange<00:04:35.980> things<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.400> can<00:04:36.550> turn<00:04:36.640> a

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
want to arrange things you can turn a

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.490 
want to arrange things you can turn a

changing one letter at a time you can

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.450 
changing one letter at a time you can

play with this for a while turn yourself

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.600 
play with this for a while turn yourself
into<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.670> fool<00:04:42.940> when<00:04:43.240> you're<00:04:43.390> done
