it all in here you see how it would be
it's<00:06:21.469> so<00:06:21.589> thick<00:06:21.919> it<00:06:22.669> adds<00:06:22.849> air<00:06:23.359> infiltration

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
it's so thick it adds air infiltration

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.109 
it's so thick it adds air infiltration
to<00:06:24.259> the<00:06:24.349> compost<00:06:24.679> also<00:06:25.069> so<00:06:25.579> you<00:06:25.639> get<00:06:25.789> a<00:06:25.819> lot<00:06:25.999> of

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:26.119 
to the compost also so you get a lot of

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.229 
to the compost also so you get a lot of
good<00:06:26.269> reasons<00:06:26.599> to<00:06:26.659> use<00:06:27.699> cardboard<00:06:28.699> as<00:06:29.059> your

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:29.239 
good reasons to use cardboard as your

Brown if you can get leaves go for it
there's<00:06:31.639> just<00:06:31.789> extra<00:06:32.059> nutrients<00:06:32.479> but<00:06:32.689> if<00:06:33.169> you

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289

mixing was he just thrown a little

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:47.439 
mixing was he just thrown a little
compost<00:06:44.059> on<00:06:44.360> top<00:06:44.389> and<00:06:45.489> it's<00:06:46.489> still<00:06:46.789> you<00:06:47.360> know

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:47.449 
compost on top and it's still you know

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.959 
compost on top and it's still you know
the<00:06:47.539> combos<00:06:47.869> not<00:06:48.049> finished<00:06:48.349> yet<00:06:48.469> of<00:06:48.589> course

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
the combos not finished yet of course

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.749 
the combos not finished yet of course
but<00:06:49.969> it's<00:06:50.569> getting<00:06:50.899> there<00:06:51.079> and<00:06:51.610> it<00:06:52.610> just

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
but it's getting there and it just

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.549 
but it's getting there and it just
incorporates<00:06:52.999> the<00:06:53.509> carbon<00:06:53.989> real<00:06:54.139> quick<00:06:54.319> and

00:06:54.549 --> 00:06:54.559 
incorporates the carbon real quick and

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.009 
incorporates the carbon real quick and
any<00:06:55.159> kind<00:06:55.459> of<00:06:55.579> green<00:06:56.029> nitrogenous<00:06:56.689> in<00:06:56.839> there

any kind of green nitrogenous in there

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:59.289 
any kind of green nitrogenous in there
will<00:06:57.649> mix<00:06:57.860> with<00:06:57.979> the<00:06:58.099> carbon<00:06:58.489> and<00:06:58.669> break<00:06:59.149> down

00:06:59.289 --> 00:06:59.299 
will mix with the carbon and break down

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:03.279 
will mix with the carbon and break down
that<00:06:59.509> much<00:06:59.659> faster<00:06:59.839> ready<00:07:00.739> for<00:07:00.919> next<00:07:01.069> year
