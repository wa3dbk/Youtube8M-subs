found in the utilities tab one of them

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.579 
found in the utilities tab one of them
is<00:00:06.089> called<00:00:06.270> snap<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> line<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> other<00:00:07.440> ones

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
is called snap a line and the other ones

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.610 
is called snap a line and the other ones
called<00:00:07.859> copy<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.280> support<00:00:09.260> first<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.410> all<00:00:10.530> I'm

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
called copy and support first of all I'm

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.049

going<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> show<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.040> snapping<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.519> line<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> snap

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
going to show you snapping a line a snap

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.169 
going to show you snapping a line a snap
a<00:00:12.090> line<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.620> how<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.679> actually<00:00:14.309> select<00:00:15.000> one

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
a line is how we actually select one

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.930 
a line is how we actually select one
object<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.870> step<00:00:16.170> along<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.619> another<00:00:16.940> in

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
object and step along it to another in

object and step along it to another in
this<00:00:18.119> particular<00:00:18.390> case<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.990> want<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.289> snap<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
this particular case I want to snap a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.150 
this particular case I want to snap a
line<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> petal<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:21.029> around<00:00:21.390> sphere<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.890> snap<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
line a petal to around sphere the snap a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.550 
line a petal to around sphere the snap a
line<00:00:23.369> works<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> basis<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.689> selecting

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
line works on the basis of selecting

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
line works on the basis of selecting
point<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.039> point<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.660> first<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.109> I've

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
point to point so first of all I've

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.710 
point to point so first of all I've
selected<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.160> actual<00:00:29.490> object<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.210> petal<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
selected the actual object the petal and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
selected the actual object the petal and
then<00:00:31.410> I'll<00:00:31.590> select<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> snap<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> line<00:00:32.489> from

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then I'll select the snap a line from

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
then I'll select the snap a line from
the<00:00:32.969> utilities<00:00:33.480> tab<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> next<00:00:39.690> thing<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
the utilities tab the next thing is is I
want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> look<00:00:40.980> specifically<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.000> point

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
want to look specifically to this point

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
want to look specifically to this point
to<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.110> simply<00:00:43.530> hold<00:00:43.680> down<00:00:43.890> the

to<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:58.020> locked<00:00:58.260> to<00:01:02.810> now<00:01:03.810> you<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.230> it's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to be locked to now you see that it's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
to be locked to now you see that it's
actually<00:01:04.650> snapped<00:01:05.160> aligned<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.910> actual

pointed upwards this is because we've

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.180 
pointed upwards this is because we've

you may want to go through these four

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
you may want to go through these four
different<00:02:39.120> types<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.780> repeat<00:02:40.080> patterns<00:02:40.410> in

different types of repeat patterns in

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.040 
different types of repeat patterns in
this<00:02:41.340> particular<00:02:41.700> case<00:02:42.090> number<00:02:42.540> Pfizer<00:02:42.780> won

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
this particular case number Pfizer won

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.580 
this particular case number Pfizer won
we<00:02:43.200> won<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.660> take<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> note<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.320> can

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
see in the properties area where it says

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.930 
see in the properties area where it says
Cologne<00:02:52.050> off<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.160> put<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> clone<00:02:53.700> on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
Cologne off if you put the clone on

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.580 
Cologne off if you put the clone on
you're<00:02:54.240> able<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.600> actually<00:02:54.990> manipulate<00:02:55.230> the

you're able to actually manipulate the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.100 
you're able to actually manipulate the
original<00:02:56.010> petal<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:56.940> automatic<00:02:57.540> by<00:02:57.870> all

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
original petal and it automatic by all

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.820 
original petal and it automatic by all
the<00:02:58.290> other<00:02:58.440> petals<00:02:58.710> with<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.130> edit<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:04.620> one

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
the other petals with that edit just one

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.080 
the other petals with that edit just one
more<00:03:04.950> thing<00:03:05.130> I'm<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.580> now<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.940> it's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
more thing I'm going to do now and it's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.520 
more thing I'm going to do now and it's
in<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.300> same<00:03:06.480> properties<00:03:06.959> area<00:03:07.110> I'm<00:03:07.350> going<00:03:07.470> to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
in the same properties area I'm going to

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.920 
in the same properties area I'm going to
change<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.860> rotation<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:09.390> bend<00:03:09.660> down

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
change the rotation just to bend down

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.180 
change the rotation just to bend down
these<00:03:10.200> petals<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.830> then<00:03:10.920> I'm<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.160> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
these petals and then I'm going to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.500 
these petals and then I'm going to
rotate<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> petals<00:03:12.330> around

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.030 

let's<00:03:15.510> bring<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> visibility<00:03:16.560> back<00:03:16.770> for<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
let's bring the visibility back for the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.690 
let's bring the visibility back for the
ball<00:03:18.560> put<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.590> into<00:03:19.830> place<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.280> then<00:03:20.340> apply

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
ball put it into place and then apply

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.240 
ball put it into place and then apply
some<00:03:20.730> moving
