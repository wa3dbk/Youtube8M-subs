it's the blue fire or the red fire make

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.780 
it's the blue fire or the red fire make
some<00:04:46.080> way<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.590> marking<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.190> just<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.580> know

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
some way of marking it just so you know

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.290 
some way of marking it just so you know
I<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.060> marked<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.200> blue<00:04:49.410> fire<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.300> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
I just marked for blue fire and the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.090 
I just marked for blue fire and the
reason<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:52.590> there<00:04:52.800> are<00:04:52.950> some

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
reason is because here there are some

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.700 
reason is because here there are some
torches<00:04:53.400> what<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.300> need<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.480> do<00:04:54.810> stand<00:04:55.470> in<00:04:55.620> the
