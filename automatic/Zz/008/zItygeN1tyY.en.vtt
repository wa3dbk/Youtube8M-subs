ordinary brick the sorts of bricks that
would<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.009> been<00:01:59.159> made<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.460> any<00:02:00.000> farm<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
would have been made on any farm in the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.190 
would have been made on any farm in the
19th<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.770> 18th<00:02:02.130> century<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.960> did

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
19th or 18th century and so what we did

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.190 
19th or 18th century and so what we did
is<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.829> give<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.430> sense<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.000> unity<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:07.020> make

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
is to give it a sense of unity to make

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.469 
is to give it a sense of unity to make
it<00:02:07.380> look<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> materials<00:02:08.520> are<00:02:08.729> actually

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it look like the materials are actually

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.330 
it look like the materials are actually
finer<00:02:09.840> than<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.410> are<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:11.250> did<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> lime<00:02:11.760> wash

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
finer than they are we did a lime wash

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.330 
finer than they are we did a lime wash
on<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:13.120> really<00:02:13.420> pale<00:02:13.870> butter<00:02:14.230> yellow<00:02:14.560> so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
on it that really pale butter yellow so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.390 
on it that really pale butter yellow so
there<00:02:15.849> we<00:02:16.450> used<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.840> faux<00:02:17.080> finish<00:02:17.500> as<00:02:17.650> well<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
there we used a faux finish as well to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
there we used a faux finish as well to
sort<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.700> project<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.420> give<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.870> certain

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
sort of project and give a certain

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.869 
sort of project and give a certain
feeling<00:02:20.739> just<00:02:21.099> as<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.340> see<00:02:21.550> here<00:02:21.790> at

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879
