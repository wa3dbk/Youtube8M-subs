in the turret so this turret is a type 5
turret<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.739> Cutlass<00:03:13.310> has<00:03:13.489> this<00:03:13.760> type<00:03:14.030> 5

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
turret the Cutlass has this type 5

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.330 
turret the Cutlass has this type 5
turret<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.049> also<00:03:15.200> has<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.709> tractor<00:03:16.160> beam

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
turret and it also has the tractor beam

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.430 
turret and it also has the tractor beam
on<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.730> bottom<00:03:17.120> those<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.750> only<00:03:17.810> two<00:03:17.989> weapons

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
on the bottom those the only two weapons

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.940 
on the bottom those the only two weapons
that'll<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.700> Cutlass<00:03:20.680> that's<00:03:21.680> about

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
that'll be on the Cutlass that's about

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.220 
that'll be on the Cutlass that's about
it<00:03:21.980> for<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:22.609> it<00:03:23.269> did<00:03:23.480> change<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.900> i<00:03:23.930> believe<00:03:23.959> it

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
it for now it did change it i believe it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.860 
it for now it did change it i believe it
was<00:03:24.290> another<00:03:24.530> type<00:03:24.769> tur<00:03:25.010> but<00:03:25.250> they<00:03:25.870> weren't

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
was another type tur but they weren't

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.270 
was another type tur but they weren't
gonna<00:03:27.019> go<00:03:27.139> through<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.500> with<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:28.040> i<00:03:28.069> think

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
gonna go through it with it i think

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.620 
gonna go through it with it i think
there's<00:03:28.549> going<00:03:28.639> to<00:03:28.730> be<00:03:28.760> another<00:03:29.060> gun<00:03:29.359> on<00:03:29.510> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
there's going to be another gun on it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.890 
there's going to be another gun on it
but<00:03:29.780> they<00:03:29.930> instead<00:03:30.500> change<00:03:30.889> that<00:03:31.280> as<00:03:32.209> far<00:03:32.569> as<00:03:32.630> i

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
but they instead change that as far as i

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.960 
but they instead change that as far as i
know<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.769> i'll<00:03:33.859> take<00:03:34.069> a<00:03:34.099> quick<00:03:34.400> seat<00:03:34.609> down<00:03:34.760> in

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970

here<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.319> believe<00:04:45.770> you<00:04:45.860> got<00:04:45.949> animations

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
here the I believe you got animations

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.570 
here the I believe you got animations
for<00:04:46.729> this<00:04:47.470> like<00:04:48.470> they<00:04:48.620> do<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.860> most<00:04:49.069> things<00:04:49.190> and

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
for this like they do of most things and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.129 
for this like they do of most things and
you're<00:04:50.120> out<00:04:50.270> in<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.389> wing<00:04:50.599> and<00:04:50.840> then<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:50.990> can

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
you're out in the wing and then you can

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.379 
you're out in the wing and then you can
shut<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.710> don't<00:04:52.550> know<00:04:52.699> if<00:04:52.849> there's<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.120> button

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
shut it I don't know if there's a button

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.430 
shut it I don't know if there's a button
actually<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.840> think<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:54.050> gotta<00:04:54.199> hit<00:04:54.349> the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
actually I think you gotta hit the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.430 
actually I think you gotta hit the
button<00:04:54.740> that's<00:04:55.099> down<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.759> the<00:04:56.270> landing<00:04:57.229> gear

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
button that's down on the landing gear

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.740 
button that's down on the landing gear
