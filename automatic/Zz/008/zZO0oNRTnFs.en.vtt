those valves on that blowout preventer I

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.990 
those valves on that blowout preventer I
mean<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.229> look<00:01:05.260> at<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.650> like<00:01:05.880> driving<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.970> car

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
mean you look at it like driving a car

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.750 
mean you look at it like driving a car
and<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:08.530> know<00:01:08.860> you're<00:01:09.040> losing<00:01:09.400> your<00:01:09.520> steering

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
and you know you're losing your steering

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.700 
and you know you're losing your steering
wheel<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.960> would<00:01:11.080> have<00:01:11.200> six<00:01:11.500> other

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
wheel and you would have six other

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.910 
wheel and you would have six other
options<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:13.030> drive<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.540> car<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.770> this

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
options to drive that car and in this

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.160 
options to drive that car and in this
case<00:01:15.159> all<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.760> them<00:01:15.850> would<00:01:16.000> fail<00:01:16.240> now<00:01:16.750> here's<00:01:17.080> a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
case all of them would fail now here's a

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.350 
case all of them would fail now here's a
look<00:01:17.380> at<00:01:17.500> two<00:01:17.770> examples<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.580> what<00:01:18.760> could<00:01:19.090> have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
look at two examples of what could have

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.430 
look at two examples of what could have
gone<00:01:19.390> wrong<00:01:19.950> shear<00:01:20.950> Ram<00:01:21.549> failure<00:01:22.510> if<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:23.170> pipe

gone wrong shear Ram failure if the pipe

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.770 
gone wrong shear Ram failure if the pipe
isn't<00:01:24.100> actually<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.880> there<00:01:25.119> straight<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
shears can't slice through just like a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.240 
shears can't slice through just like a
pair<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.090> scissors<00:01:28.119> or<00:01:28.720> if<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.799> look<00:01:29.979> at<00:01:30.130> this

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
pair of scissors or if you look at this

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.230 
pair of scissors or if you look at this
next<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:32.140> here<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.950> tool<00:01:33.340> joint<00:01:33.939> says

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
next one right here the tool joint says

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.469 
next one right here the tool joint says
they're<00:01:34.450> called<00:01:34.479> could<00:01:35.439> have<00:01:35.710> been<00:01:35.979> somehow

they're called could have been somehow

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.600 
they're called could have been somehow
obstructed<00:01:37.479> or<00:01:37.659> failed<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.439> some<00:01:39.040> other<00:01:39.280> way

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
obstructed or failed in some other way

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.359

again those shears not able to stop the
flow<00:01:42.580> now<00:01:43.150> I<00:01:43.180> want<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.840> see<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.170> one<00:01:44.409> as

flow now I want you to see this one as

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.530 
flow now I want you to see this one as
well<00:01:44.680> this<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.189> animation<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.270> dome

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
well this is the animation of the dome

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.330 
well this is the animation of the dome
this<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.049> what<00:01:47.200> BP<00:01:47.619> described<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.189> like

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
this is what BP described is like

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.780 
this is what BP described is like
lowering<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.150> four-story<00:01:49.750> high<00:01:50.020> building<00:01:50.530> onto

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
the head of a pin this effort failed

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.219 
the head of a pin this effort failed
when<00:01:54.490> crystals<00:01:54.939> built<00:01:55.240> up<00:01:55.450> inside<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:56.020> dome

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
when crystals built up inside the dome

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.980 
when crystals built up inside the dome
but<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:57.009> procedure<00:01:57.400> experts<00:01:58.180> say<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.420> BP

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
but it's a procedure experts say that BP
