00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 good guys today I will show you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.189
 how to create a partition within the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.730
 windows will also show you how to create 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.980
 a partition using virtual programs 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.020
 remember that to install programs 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.490
 we need a partition but it's not 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.650
 necessary to format all our equipment 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 it's enough for us to give him a partition 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
 additional to the partition that we have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 inside our hard drive remember 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 that a partition allows us to divide 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.260
 our hard drive in several segments 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.030
 without further ado I leave you with the video 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.980
 good guys we are inside 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.260
 windows 8 what we are going to do is create 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.930
 a physical partition partition to our 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.420
 hard drive in two without having to 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.890
 format according okay guys we 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.460
 we found in the windows desktop 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.339
 8 we enter the browser with the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.869
 guys and now what we 're going to do is 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.869
 in the team 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:09.250
 secondary click administer memory 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.350
 guys administer wait for me to load and 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 as you can see this is pressure other 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.909
 screen on this screen what we have 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.750
 what to select is administration of 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.820
 discs 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.110
 according to guys look for this 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.780
 Disk Management 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.450
 look for there there in the part of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.730
 below excellent we give you click and as 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.070
 can see we have appeared in the part 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.620
 from below as you see here has appeared 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.800
 of blue the original partition that is the 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.410
 disk will agree normally 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.000
 assigns the computer the pse since the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.880
 unit was the disc an old disc the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.710
 see also says are the disks and that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:57.990
 now they also have sata connection and already 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:59.790
 it's fine as you can see it has appeared 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.800
 the blue bar with the unit I know that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.500
 our main album what we're going 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.540
 to do is reduce let's reduce the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.149
 space the space that we are not using 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.760
 inside our hard drive so that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.550
 enable us to create another partition 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.860
 we hope as you can see the video what 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.930
 I'm going to move forward because this will take 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.440
 according to your computer and according to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.590
 hard disk that has 750 a giga 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.959
 or lesser memory guys 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.690
 well now what we think is a 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.730
 message show us the partition when 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.920
 is the original size that we have 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.459
 how much is the partition that we can 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.230
 assign and gives us the option to give a 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.140
 custom partition is to say 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.150
 we can assign the same 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.340
 amount of space that we want to use from 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
 our hard drive if we want we give it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.450
 the maximum as it is or if not what 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
 we reduce so that our disk 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.830
 original or conserve unit 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.829
 some files or spaces for over 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.440
 We wanted the boys to free him 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.959
 We give in following and as you can see what 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.480
 that has appeared to us is an option 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.000
 we have our unit of our unit 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.010
 I know it's blue and on the side we 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.720
 appeared one of black color that is the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.730
 new partition that we just created 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.250
 but nevertheless this partition does not have 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.680
 format so as you can see I'm going to 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.079
 give a format I recommend using the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.870
 ntfs system is the system 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.780
 files that we currently use there is the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.970
 file system for 32 that is used 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.450
 in some cases the people who want 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.360
 install windows xp or windows 98 be 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.040
 the case can use that option of what 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.040
 otherwise, I recommend that you use the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.239
 peace option 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.680
 the 32 but the ntfs that is the current 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.230
 alright guys we give you the following 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.299
 here in this combo box what we have is 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.120
 the allocated space we can select 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.080
 or we leave it as it is in the original 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.200
 we give in following 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.780
 well we can also assign our 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.360
 label name is the name 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.830
 that we are going to assign to our unit 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:12.020
 select the unit type cd and iu 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.840
 next accept as you can see already 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.180
 we have two partitions in my case as 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.269
 come is a very small partition since 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.950
 my hard drive is strong is full of 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.590
 agreement guys but in the case of 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.960
 you can not assign the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.200
 space that you want according to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.590
 each hard drive already remember the space 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.770
 that we assign this the whole total a 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.560
 percentage and of that percentage we can 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.170
 choose less but no more agree 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.880
 guys this would be all the video we closed 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.980
 our applications and how can you see 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.410
 in the browser we already see two 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.720
 units unit I know that's where I have 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.200
 installed my windows 8 and the unit that 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.050
 where I have tagged a name 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.020
 josÃ© de haro 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.270
 and good as you see the files are 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.210
 they keep I have not lost anything they are my 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.759
 documents my images my videos my 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.009
 music everything is according to this 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:11.020
 partition is a secure partition not 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.900
 We are going to damage any of our files 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.569
 the main desk everything conserves 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.479
 same good guys up here this video 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:23.590
 then I will show you how 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.629
 partition in a virtual way that is 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.210
 create a virtual machine to be able to 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.379
 install windows 8 good looks or 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.090
 any other windows 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.090
 good up here this video
