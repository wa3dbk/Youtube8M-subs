00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.600
 very good other kids that you are 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.330
 my mother the second video of the day m 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.610
 I'm getting over top of a power 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.389
 endorsements and distract again an advantage 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.530
 secret that has come out in transit mode 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.019
 from the last update I think that 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.640
 I started 3 normal tucked but you have me 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.109
 said the comments grew like that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.169
 update I say that's because you have 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.999
 ps3 always 7 because we got the 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.329
 update but good as this 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.099
 morning 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.749
 good until noon or has gone up the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.939
 of the red skull that killed the 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.340
 zombies only counted carlos as I say 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.830
 Well now I'm going up in the afternoon 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.990
 of the juggernaut pro or I call him yes 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.700
 the titan pro and I say how is 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.430
 related and tomorrow revolution is coming 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.300
 because as it is I am not going in the afternoon and 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.250
 it's so it's a trick for the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.200
 zombies have to give you more touches 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.360
 Now you will see how many touches you get 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.560
 is what you have to do, I think it's 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.550
 well or you've seen people explaining it 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.380
 in a way that I sincerely believe 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.630
 that is so I think that the only thing 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.220
 what to do is buy then remove 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.470
 there are the zombies been a touch you 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 You recover, I'm not getting 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.800
 a touch you apart I feel the time 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.080
 as done already 45 times 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.420
 here you see me let me kill pim pam left 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.450
 kill shot with with the gun to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.090
 I usually kill them some do this already 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 you know it 's buying you Kuwait they give you 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.820
 you recover and so the whole king all the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.070
 time you see how the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.920
 dust this mysterious green that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.800
 always comes out I buy now call me 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.910
 have I 'm not to get points for 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.970
 buy me opponents just in case 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.730
 killed but good with this trick the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.320
 zombies are going to kill you without you is 4 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.570
 doubles or four strokes you're going to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.920
 be on the ground then good here 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.220
 I was di is making points for 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.110
 buy me again that up and there they go 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.670
 I have been given two touches that 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.840
 they would normally kill but they have not 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.620
 killed there I think it looks a lot better 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.620
 I also go to see 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 now I think some two 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.469
 it's like killed four times 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.820
 try to kill four with touches in 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.250
 three clear the question you ask yourself is 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.069
 so I think if it's disturbing enough 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.379
 and four touches a titan and how many 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.769
 touches kill you because here I already had 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.910
 titan had helped electricity and 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.549
 let's check the truth that this is 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.080
 an exaggeration because that serves as a 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.879
 cheto the helps these that are us 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.959
 getting to look here one two three four 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.879
 five six touches to die for and 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.459
 when before there were three or one thing 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.989
 quite quite exaggerated this I 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.220
 I would like to show the map of tim rice is 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.590
 something impossible and that's why they are not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.590
 putting all these aids so nothing 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.319
 you know and so but the bait the key 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.819
 having thrown the sinaÃ­ seen served 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.220
 you have it up here and nothing 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.319
 quite handsome lads so it has 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.760
 Suicide here or anything expresses liked 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.470
 this advantage and now with the put in 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.720
 practice finally tomorrow is the big day 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.450
 Tuesday revolution is but it is the state 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.910
 the advantage of giving you extra favorites and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.239
 see you tomorrow with many goodbye videos 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.239
 kids
