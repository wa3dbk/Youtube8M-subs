00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
even then sir let's just upgrade the cpu

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
even then sir let's just upgrade the cpu
first<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> foremost<00:01:18.570> cause<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> most

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
first and foremost cause it's the most

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.440 
first and foremost cause it's the most
important<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:20.299> we're<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
important thing now we're going to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.160 
important thing now we're going to
upgrade<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.869> pentium<00:01:22.610> g2020<00:01:23.900> clock<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> two

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
upgrade to a pentium g2020 clock the two

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.190 
upgrade to a pentium g2020 clock the two
point<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.439> gigahertz<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.780> finally<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.049> can

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
point on gigahertz and finally you can

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
point on gigahertz and finally you can
use<00:01:28.380> Intel's<00:01:28.799> latest<00:01:28.890> nano<00:01:29.460> architecture

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
use Intel's latest nano architecture

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
use Intel's latest nano architecture
which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> 22<00:01:30.720> nanometers<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.130> think

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
which is 22 nanometers and I think

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.330 
which is 22 nanometers and I think
that's<00:01:32.549> an<00:01:32.670> epic<00:01:32.970> win<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.329> 59<00:01:33.750> bucks<00:01:34.189> maybe<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's an epic win at 59 bucks maybe you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's an epic win at 59 bucks maybe you
can<00:01:35.460> find<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.700> cheaper<00:01:36.030> although<00:01:36.540> i'm<00:01:37.220> guessing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
can find a cheaper although i'm guessing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.429 
can find a cheaper although i'm guessing
59<00:01:38.579> bucks<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.060> pretty<00:01:39.540> easy<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> find<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you're going to put into your build is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
you're going to put into your build is
the<00:01:48.240> motherboard<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.619> case<00:01:49.829> we're<00:01:49.979> going

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the motherboard in this case we're going

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.819 
the motherboard in this case we're going
to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.369> using<00:01:50.399> an<00:01:50.759> asus<00:01:51.439> p88<00:01:52.439> 61<00:01:53.399> m<00:01:53.960> LX<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.530> uses

to be using an asus p88 61 m LX so uses

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550 
to be using an asus p88 61 m LX so uses
a<00:01:55.860> h61<00:01:56.670> chipset<00:01:57.299> unfortunately<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.290> it's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
a h61 chipset unfortunately but it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.690 
a h61 chipset unfortunately but it's
really<00:01:58.950> cheap<00:01:59.460> at<00:02:00.390> 29<00:02:00.689> bucks<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:02.070> can't<00:02:02.430> beat

that kind of value for money although

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
that kind of value for money although
yes<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.520> perfect<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.210> mean<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.659> know

yes it's not perfect but I mean you know
that's<00:02:07.439> that's<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.979> how<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
that's that's just how it is

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
oil ram yeah we're still going to be

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.160 
oil ram yeah we're still going to be
using<00:02:11.920> two<00:02:12.340> gigabytes<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.480> triple<00:02:13.930> three

using two gigabytes of one triple three
megahertz<00:02:14.650> Ram<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.070> course<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.210> not<00:02:16.240> good

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
megahertz Ram of course this is not good

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.260 
megahertz Ram of course this is not good
it's<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.380> only<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.950> enough<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.850> would

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
it's it's only just enough so I would

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.610 
it's it's only just enough so I would
strongly<00:02:19.540> recommend<00:02:19.660> blowing<00:02:20.380> your<00:02:20.500> budget

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.530 
those in but for now we're using two
gigs<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.030> stick<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> budget

thing we're getting in this build and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.890 
thing we're getting in this build and
this<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.760> probably<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.270> best<00:02:43.450> part<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this is probably the best part of the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.030 
this is probably the best part of the
builds<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.470> know<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.680> probably<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
builds you know it's probably the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.150 
builds you know it's probably the
lifesaver<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.940> build<00:02:46.150> because<00:02:47.160> finally

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
lifesaver of this build because finally

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.860 
lifesaver of this build because finally
going<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> upgrade<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.090> graphics<00:02:49.120> card<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.840> a
