 body fat rate 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.010
 then start with bodybuilding because in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.110
 any physical activity we start 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.730
 as a source of energy, we have to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 reduce the risk rate the genius for 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.940
 and you live there around 15 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.280
 20 minutes 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.530
 this time you are already decreasing the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 fat ratio in weight that there 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.760
