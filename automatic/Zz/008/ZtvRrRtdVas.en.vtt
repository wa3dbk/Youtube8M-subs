00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
packages and that's the fact that you

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.759 
packages and that's the fact that you
cannot<00:00:20.070> open<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.789> get<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.769> CDA

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
of the specs so a to 22,000 frequency

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
of the specs so a to 22,000 frequency
range<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> quite<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> call<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
range is quite a call so that's the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
range is quite a call so that's the

now<00:02:13.670> physically<00:02:16.060> isolation<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.270> enigmas

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
now physically isolation on the enigmas

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.330 
now physically isolation on the enigmas
is<00:02:17.930> slightly<00:02:18.410> bear<00:02:18.740> just<00:02:18.980> clear<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.220> bit

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
is slightly bear just clear a bit

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.710 
is slightly bear just clear a bit
smaller<00:02:19.670> than<00:02:19.790> get<00:02:20.090> deeper<00:02:20.450> into<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.930> now<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
smaller than get deeper into it now I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.620 
smaller than get deeper into it now I
guess<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:23.960> bit<00:02:24.050> more<00:02:24.170> comfy<00:02:24.650> because

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
guess have a bit more comfy because

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.390 
guess have a bit more comfy because
these<00:02:26.630> are<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.440> heavier<00:02:27.800> side<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.370> I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
these are on the heavier side but I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.290 
these are on the heavier side but I
still<00:02:28.640> find<00:02:28.850> them<00:02:29.000> both<00:02:29.240> really<00:02:29.630> comfy

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300

important<00:03:08.540> factor<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.900> me<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.530> I'm<00:03:09.740> sure<00:03:09.770> it's

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
important factor to me and I'm sure it's

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.190 
important factor to me and I'm sure it's
the<00:03:10.160> most<00:03:10.310> important<00:03:10.700> fact<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the most important fact that you and the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.590 
the most important fact that you and the
little<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.350> mean<00:03:15.530> where<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.800> cables<00:03:16.600> silver

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
little I mean where the cables silver

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.970 
little I mean where the cables silver
bullets<00:03:17.990> are<00:03:19.510> an<00:03:20.510> incredible<00:03:21.140> specimen<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
bullets are an incredible specimen of

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.690 
bullets are an incredible specimen of
any<00:03:23.590> monitors<00:03:24.590> because<00:03:25.040> they<00:03:25.250> sound

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
any monitors because they sound

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.780 
any monitors because they sound
fantastic<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.340> sounded

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
fantastic and I think that sounded

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.090 
fantastic and I think that sounded
fantastic<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.360> partly<00:03:30.080> due<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.770> fact<00:03:30.980> that

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
fantastic is partly due to the fact that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.530 
fantastic is partly due to the fact that
they<00:03:31.280> sound<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> unique<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:33.770> I'm<00:03:34.520> different<00:03:35.420> to
