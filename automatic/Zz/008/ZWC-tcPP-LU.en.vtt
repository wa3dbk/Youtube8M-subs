00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
because of the way our knees fit

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.250 
because of the way our knees fit
together<00:00:58.340> in<00:00:58.550> dance<00:00:58.760> position<00:00:59.300> when<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.050> want

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
to close our feet our knees will not

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.219 
to close our feet our knees will not
interlock<00:01:03.519> instead<00:01:04.519> we<00:01:05.449> will<00:01:05.659> keep<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.020> knees

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
interlock instead we will keep the knees

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.800 
interlock instead we will keep the knees
in<00:01:06.619> front<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.250> each<00:01:07.369> other<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.000> right<00:01:08.240> knee<00:01:08.509> my

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
in front of each other the right knee my

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.480 
in front of each other the right knee my
right<00:01:09.079> knee<00:01:09.259> is<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.590> front<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.860> her<00:01:09.979> right<00:01:10.009> knee

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
right knee is in front of her right knee

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.399 
right knee is in front of her right knee
so<00:01:11.210> if<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.389> look<00:01:11.569> at<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:11.810> if<00:01:11.990> we<00:01:12.079> take<00:01:12.229> this

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
so if we look at this if we take this

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.719 
so if we look at this if we take this
from<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.649> forward<00:01:12.950> lunge<00:01:13.100> go<00:01:13.219> ahead<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.579> lunge

slightly<00:02:03.829> forward<00:02:04.189> for<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.429> lady<00:02:04.609> and<00:02:04.849> then

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
slightly forward for the lady and then

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.410 
slightly forward for the lady and then
instead<00:02:05.959> of<00:02:06.020> just<00:02:06.529> closing<00:02:06.919> the<00:02:07.009> foot<00:02:07.219> we<00:02:07.849> draw

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
instead of just closing the foot we draw

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.990 
instead of just closing the foot we draw
the<00:02:08.479> foot<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.080> part<00:02:09.470> way<00:02:09.649> now<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.490> reason<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
the foot in part way now the reason the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.030 
the foot in part way now the reason the
foot<00:02:11.209> only<00:02:11.300> draws<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:11.780> part<00:02:12.020> way<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.380> because

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
foot only draws in part way is because

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.210 
foot only draws in part way is because
in<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.970> particular<00:02:14.209> case<00:02:14.680> our<00:02:15.680> knees

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
in this particular case our knees

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.399 
in this particular case our knees
interlock<00:02:16.939> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.329> see<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.780> if<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.379> show

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
interlock you can see that if we show

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.900 
interlock you can see that if we show
this<00:02:18.799> from<00:02:19.129> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
this from the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.430 
this from the
back<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.690> my<00:02:20.870> knee<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.170> between

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
back you can see my knee is in between

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.530 
back you can see my knee is in between
her<00:02:21.920> knees<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.730> prevents<00:02:23.210> her<00:02:23.330> foot

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
her knees and that prevents her foot

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.540 
her knees and that prevents her foot
from<00:02:23.720> closing<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.260> while<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.220> could

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
from closing and while we could

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.760 
from closing and while we could
technically<00:02:26.090> close<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.600> foot<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.380> would

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
technically close the foot it would

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.250 
technically close the foot it would
leave<00:02:28.010> us<00:02:28.040> with<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:29.030> whole<00:02:29.270> lot<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.450> ugly<00:02:29.690> you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
leave us with a whole lot of ugly you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.350 
leave us with a whole lot of ugly you
can<00:02:30.410> see<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:31.130> if<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.880> make<00:02:32.030> space<00:02:32.300> for

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
can see that if I have to make space for

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
can see that if I have to make space for
a<00:02:32.600> knee<00:02:32.750> between<00:02:32.930> my<00:02:33.260> knees<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:33.800> close<00:02:34.100> my
