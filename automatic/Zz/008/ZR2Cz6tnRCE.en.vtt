your<00:00:36.690> rolling<00:00:36.809> pin<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:47.120> don't<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> go

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
your rolling pin you don't want to go

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
your rolling pin you don't want to go
too<00:00:48.450> thin<00:00:48.870> maybe<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.170> quarter<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.739> inch<00:00:49.829> is

okay and then we're going to cut a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
okay and then we're going to cut a
circle<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.219> to

you're going to start to smooth the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.230 
you're going to start to smooth the
coils<00:02:30.050> into<00:02:30.230> each<00:02:30.530> other<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.940> you're<00:02:32.060> going<00:02:32.209> to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
coils into each other so you're going to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.120 
coils into each other so you're going to
just<00:02:32.300> take<00:02:32.569> your<00:02:32.720> thumb<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.200> smooth<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.860> coil

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
your fingerprints and you can just start

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.210

that's going to smooth that out okay so

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.670 
that's going to smooth that out okay so
now<00:03:28.400> your<00:03:28.670> Bell<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.150> completely<00:03:29.959> smooth<00:03:30.350> it's

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
now your Bell is completely smooth it's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.949 
now your Bell is completely smooth it's
been<00:03:30.860> flared<00:03:31.250> out<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.820> you're<00:03:32.540> going<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.690> turn

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
it over so there it looks like the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.870 
it over so there it looks like the
Liberty<00:03:35.630> Bell<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.040> we're<00:03:37.040> going<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.310> add<00:03:37.489> the
