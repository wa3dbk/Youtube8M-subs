00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and clay let's see what else there is

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.970 
and clay let's see what else there is
some<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.140> mechanics<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.800> gonna

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
some of the mechanics that are gonna

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.940 
some of the mechanics that are gonna
change<00:02:44.340> hold<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.090> charge<00:02:45.269> bows<00:02:45.630> uh<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.709> think

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
change hold the charge bows uh I think

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.440 
change hold the charge bows uh I think
it's<00:02:47.040> kind<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.220> cool<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.820> was<00:02:48.150> used<00:02:48.390> to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it's kind of cool because I was used to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.120 
it's kind of cool because I was used to
that<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.780> pc<00:02:49.050> when<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> came<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.709> Xbox

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that on the pc when I came to the Xbox

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.820 
that on the pc when I came to the Xbox
when<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.940> actually<00:02:51.209> built<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.750> bow<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.410> was<00:02:52.739> like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
when I actually built a bow it was like

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.560 
when I actually built a bow it was like
an<00:02:52.920> automatic<00:02:53.400> weapon<00:02:53.670> was<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.850> an<00:02:53.940> m16<00:02:54.480> you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
an automatic weapon was like an m16 you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.470 
an automatic weapon was like an m16 you
like<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.870> I'd<00:02:54.989> edit<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.100> I'm<00:02:56.580> like<00:02:56.610> man<00:02:57.090> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
like that I'd edit it and I'm like man I

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.150 
like that I'd edit it and I'm like man I
want<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.989> hold<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.890> aim

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
want to go to hold it back you can aim

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.670 
want to go to hold it back you can aim
the<00:02:59.730> longer<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.420> press<00:03:00.810> down<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.290> button<00:03:01.500> i

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
the longer you press down the button i

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220 
the longer you press down the button i
assume<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> xbox<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:03.000> controller<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
assume on the xbox of controller the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.479 
assume on the xbox of controller the
further<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.830> go<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.100> more<00:03:05.250> powerful

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
further is going to go the more powerful

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.040 
further is going to go the more powerful
it's<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.850> be<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.750> kind<00:03:07.019> of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
it's going to be so if you just kind of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.479 
it's going to be so if you just kind of
tap<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.370> know

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
tap it it's just going to be you know

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.750 
tap it it's just going to be you know
very<00:03:08.670> close<00:03:08.910> very<00:03:09.150> quick<00:03:09.420> um<00:03:10.519> what<00:03:11.519> else<00:03:11.640> are

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
very close very quick um what else are

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.130 
very close very quick um what else are
they<00:03:11.819> bring<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.180> critical<00:03:12.660> hit<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:12.930> gonna<00:03:13.019> be

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
they bring in critical hit it's gonna be

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.840 
they bring in critical hit it's gonna be
cool<00:03:13.290> players<00:03:13.890> can<00:03:14.100> pair<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.430> with<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.580> sword

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
cool players can pair you with a sword

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.640 
cool players can pair you with a sword
parrying<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> sword<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.200> basically

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
parrying with the sword is basically

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.100 
parrying with the sword is basically
blocking<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.160> using<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.910> shield<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.959> let's

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
blocking and using as a shield so let's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.900 
blocking and using as a shield so let's
say<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> zombie<00:03:19.620> comes<00:03:19.769> up<00:03:19.890> here<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.280> parry<00:03:20.579> him

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
say a zombie comes up here you parry him

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.180 
say a zombie comes up here you parry him
and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.720> start<00:03:21.930> swinging<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.980> that's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
and then you start swinging so that's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.220 
and then you start swinging so that's
gonna<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.610> cool<00:03:23.760> even<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.209> PvP<00:03:24.900> vamps

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
gonna be kind of cool even for PvP vamps

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.319 
gonna be kind of cool even for PvP vamps
you<00:03:25.709> play<00:03:25.860> against<00:03:26.130> your<00:03:26.190> friends<00:03:26.760> or<00:03:27.269> if

you play against your friends or if

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.120 
you play against your friends or if
you're<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.480> messing<00:03:28.110> around<00:03:28.170> doing

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
you're just messing around doing

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.259 
you're just messing around doing
something<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.700> that'll<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.090> kind<00:03:30.239> of

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
something like that that'll be kind of

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.400 
something like that that'll be kind of
cool<00:03:30.590> let's<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.860> what<00:03:32.040> else<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:32.340> there

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
cool let's see what else is there

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.569 
cool let's see what else is there
experience<00:03:34.410> words<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.860> when<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.070> go<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.370> kill

experience words so when you go and kill

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.000 
experience words so when you go and kill
pigs<00:03:36.030> cow<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:37.019> typically<00:03:37.380> get<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.739> one

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
pigs cow you typically get like one
