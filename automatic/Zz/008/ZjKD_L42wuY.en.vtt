 who says dakar many unforeseen in 2005 the 7th stage will turn into 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.780
 nightmare for capricious weather competitors a dry out rescue 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.760
 by helicopter offer a cocktail of the day all sprinkled it is a good 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.820
 dose of sand 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.860
 it's well known the reader really starts when one crosses the 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.069
 Mauritanian border 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.089
 in 2005 the 7th stage between the player immediately 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.289
 or bring proof 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.120
 with 660 km of the longest special stage of the rally and the weather is bad 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.870
 with a strong sand wind 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.050
 consequence the reliefs and disappear the sand softens the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 on gasoline threat 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150
 in these tricky conditions many competitors in a hurry 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.149
 to reach resident tichitt before the night 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.520
 gone to fault 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 no 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.030
 ap 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 this applies to both amateurs and professionals 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.230
 in these conditions the bikers exhausted themselves constantly 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 machines when it's not about raising it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.130
 on a terrain become extremely tricky the crash falls the bomb gets 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.130
 multiply 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.730
 amateurs whose 40% dispute the test for the first time are obviously 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.730
 the first to suffer 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.900
 but especially with a very soft sand gas consumption exceeds all 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.670
 the forecasts 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.570
 and competitors scattered in the dunes goes out of the trees 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.150
 others 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
 while the best ones do not just have to come to the country 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.049
 most amateurs must therefore prepare to spend the night in the 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.769
 desert and group themselves in small groups 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.769
 you have to resist the cold sands while the storm does not weaken 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.309
 others prefer to go ahead even if every kilometer seems 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.339
 infinite whether in actions handled by assistance trucks like the 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.339
 believes Ari Vatanen quadruple winner of the event

 he's organizing the rescue while helicopters dog competitors 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.289
 in the end a third of them will give up in this step 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.039
 made possible by the weather 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.759
