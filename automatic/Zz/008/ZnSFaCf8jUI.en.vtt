00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:03.189 
all right so here's an experiment I

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.040 
all right so here's an experiment I
wanted<00:00:03.459> to<00:00:03.520> run<00:00:03.729> I've<00:00:04.030> got<00:00:04.210> the<00:00:05.020> car<00:00:05.290> here<00:00:05.529> and

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050 
wanted to run I've got the car here and

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:17.509 
wanted to run I've got the car here and
my<00:00:08.050> bag<00:00:08.770> of<00:00:10.470> it<00:00:11.470> used<00:00:13.200> half<00:00:14.200> used<00:00:15.029> charcoal<00:00:16.080> so

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:17.519 
my bag of it used half used charcoal so

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.169 
my bag of it used half used charcoal so
in<00:00:18.519> order<00:00:18.640> to<00:00:18.789> make<00:00:19.000> it<00:00:19.150> more<00:00:19.589> bioavailable

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
in order to make it more bioavailable

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.609 
in order to make it more bioavailable
for<00:00:22.179> the<00:00:22.210> garden<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:23.019> thought<00:00:23.230> I'd<00:00:23.380> just<00:00:23.499> run

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
for the garden I thought I'd just run

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.339 
for the garden I thought I'd just run
over<00:00:24.220> it<00:00:24.339> a<00:00:24.400> few<00:00:24.609> times<00:00:24.820> it's<00:00:25.720> about<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.140> size

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
over it a few times it's about the size

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.409 
over it a few times it's about the size
of<00:00:26.499> briquettes<00:00:26.980> right<00:00:27.310> now<00:00:27.490> summer<00:00:27.939> chunks

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
of briquettes right now summer chunks

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.010 
of briquettes right now summer chunks
are<00:00:28.570> bigger<00:00:28.779> than<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.199> but<00:00:30.070> anyway<00:00:31.029> let's

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
are bigger than that but anyway let's

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.200 
are bigger than that but anyway let's
give<00:00:32.200> it<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.380> whirl

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
give it a whirl

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680 
give it a whirl
all<00:00:34.210> right<00:00:34.510> ran<00:00:35.110> that<00:00:35.320> sucker<00:00:35.710> over<00:00:36.510> five<00:00:37.510> or

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
all right ran that sucker over five or

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.800 
all right ran that sucker over five or
six<00:00:37.960> maybe<00:00:38.380> ten<00:00:38.740> times<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.520> had<00:00:40.240> to<00:00:40.360> move<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.690> out

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
six maybe ten times I had to move it out

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.150 
six maybe ten times I had to move it out
on<00:00:40.990> a<00:00:41.020> surface<00:00:41.830> that<00:00:41.860> won't<00:00:42.190> slide<00:00:42.550> around<00:00:42.580> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
on a surface that won't slide around so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.850 
on a surface that won't slide around so
anyway<00:00:45.160> let's<00:00:46.090> take<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.450> to<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.570> garden<00:00:46.960> okay

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
anyway let's take it to the garden okay

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.800 
anyway let's take it to the garden okay
so<00:00:47.920> down<00:00:48.190> here<00:00:48.490> we<00:00:48.700> have<00:00:50.190> charcoal<00:00:51.190> that

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
so down here we have charcoal that

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.240 
so down here we have charcoal that
wasn't<00:00:52.810> beat-up<00:00:53.200> or<00:00:53.560> anything<00:00:53.800> that's<00:00:53.980> pretty

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
wasn't beat-up or anything that's pretty

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.670 
wasn't beat-up or anything that's pretty
much<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.670> size<00:00:54.910> of<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.270> smaller<00:00:56.050> stuff<00:00:56.440> like

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
much the size of it smaller stuff like

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.460 
much the size of it smaller stuff like
that<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.220> center<00:00:57.640> longer<00:00:58.210> stuff<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:59.350> know

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
that in the center longer stuff you know

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.710 
that in the center longer stuff you know
stuff<00:00:59.740> like<00:00:59.830> this<00:01:00.160> but<00:01:00.880> basically<00:01:01.060> it<00:01:01.450> says

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
stuff like this but basically it says

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.109 
stuff like this but basically it says
I'm<00:01:01.960> crunched<00:01:02.440> up<00:01:02.590> I<00:01:02.890> was<00:01:03.430> just<00:01:03.580> using<00:01:03.790> this

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
I'm crunched up I was just using this

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.859 
I'm crunched up I was just using this
stone<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.649> a<00:01:05.789> hammer<00:01:06.789> to<00:01:07.030> break<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.749> up

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
stone and and a hammer to break it up

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.109 
stone and and a hammer to break it up
but<00:01:08.109> it's<00:01:08.439> pretty<00:01:08.979> laborious<00:01:09.219> but<00:01:09.759> I<00:01:09.789> figured

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
but it's pretty laborious but I figured

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.889 
but it's pretty laborious but I figured
one<00:01:10.780> bag<00:01:11.640> it'll<00:01:12.640> be<00:01:12.789> pretty<00:01:13.060> short<00:01:13.299> work<00:01:13.570> but

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
one bag it'll be pretty short work but

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.859 
one bag it'll be pretty short work but
the<00:01:14.740> car<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.189> much<00:01:15.759> quicker<00:01:16.030> much<00:01:16.359> much

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
the car is much quicker much much

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.399 
the car is much quicker much much
quicker<00:01:17.579> all<00:01:18.579> right<00:01:18.850> there<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:19.299> go<00:01:19.509> I've

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
quicker all right there we go I've

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.849 
quicker all right there we go I've
poured<00:01:20.679> it<00:01:20.859> out<00:01:20.950> into<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:22.259> bucket<00:01:23.259> there<00:01:23.560> and

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
poured it out into the bucket there and

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.859 
poured it out into the bucket there and
as<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.880> can<00:01:25.030> see<00:01:26.069> we<00:01:27.069> get<00:01:27.219> some<00:01:27.670> pretty<00:01:28.569> fine

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
as you can see we get some pretty fine

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.069 
as you can see we get some pretty fine
stuff<00:01:29.319> get<00:01:30.130> some<00:01:30.340> chunky<00:01:30.759> stuff<00:01:31.060> here<00:01:31.450> still<00:01:31.780> I

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
stuff get some chunky stuff here still I

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.620 
stuff get some chunky stuff here still I
kind<00:01:32.829> of<00:01:32.859> ran<00:01:33.039> it<00:01:33.189> over<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.520> few<00:01:33.700> more<00:01:33.909> times<00:01:34.240> I

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
kind of ran it over a few more times I

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.889 
kind of ran it over a few more times I
got<00:01:35.229> got<00:01:35.439> this<00:01:35.649> down<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:35.950> some<00:01:36.639> pretty<00:01:36.939> pretty

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
got got this down to some pretty pretty

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.109 
got got this down to some pretty pretty
small<00:01:38.200> stuff<00:01:38.499> but<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.950> don't<00:01:39.399> know<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.700> for

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
small stuff but I don't know it just for

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.209 
small stuff but I don't know it just for
some<00:01:40.149> reason<00:01:40.509> I<00:01:40.810> figure<00:01:41.139> I<00:01:41.380> want<00:01:41.889> the<00:01:42.009> big

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
some reason I figure I want the big

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.309 
some reason I figure I want the big
stuff<00:01:42.520> along<00:01:42.789> with<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.090> little<00:01:43.240> stuff<00:01:43.569> it

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
stuff along with the little stuff it

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.919 
stuff along with the little stuff it
seems<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.679> be<00:01:44.770> working<00:01:44.979> no<00:01:45.340> matter<00:01:45.549> what<00:01:45.929> so

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
seems to be working no matter what so

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.800 
seems to be working no matter what so
over<00:01:47.889> the<00:01:48.009> years<00:01:48.039> I'm<00:01:48.579> sure<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:49.119> big<00:01:49.509> stuff

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
over the years I'm sure the big stuff

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.770 
over the years I'm sure the big stuff
will<00:01:49.990> end<00:01:50.409> up<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.770> be<00:01:50.920> little<00:01:51.219> or<00:01:51.340> anyway<00:01:51.780> but

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
will end up to be little or anyway but

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.999 
will end up to be little or anyway but
you<00:01:53.740> know<00:01:54.539> kind<00:01:55.539> of<00:01:55.569> want<00:01:55.719> some<00:01:55.929> bigger<00:01:56.499> chunks

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
you know kind of want some bigger chunks

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.120 
you know kind of want some bigger chunks
for<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.249> reservoirs<00:01:57.819> to<00:01:58.119> suck<00:01:58.329> up<00:01:59.130> whatever

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
for the reservoirs to suck up whatever

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.069 
for the reservoirs to suck up whatever
it<00:02:00.399> sucks<00:02:00.639> up<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:00.999> have<00:02:01.209> no<00:02:01.359> idea<00:02:01.630> what<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.929> to

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
it sucks up I have no idea what this to

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.389 
it sucks up I have no idea what this to
how<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.380> stuff<00:02:02.590> works<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:03.009> don't<00:02:03.189> know<00:02:03.279> if

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
how this stuff works I don't know if

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.889 
how this stuff works I don't know if
anybody<00:02:03.999> else<00:02:04.179> does<00:02:04.479> either

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
anybody else does either

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.279 
anybody else does either
I<00:02:05.049> know<00:02:05.889> it<00:02:06.009> works<00:02:06.420> put<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.509> on<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.689> garden<00:02:08.080> it

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
I know it works put it on the garden it

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.110 
I know it works put it on the garden it
grows<00:02:08.530> good<00:02:08.939> so<00:02:09.939> anyway

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.300 

go<00:02:13.299> back<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.569> my<00:02:13.690> garden<00:02:14.019> here<00:02:14.200> throw<00:02:15.099> some
