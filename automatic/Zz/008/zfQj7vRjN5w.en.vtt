00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.690
 do not 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.180
 Y 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.949
 since we were little they have taught us 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.779
 behave in a way like with the 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.369
 brothers 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.369
 what are they doing 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:43.120
 in the house of grandparents good this 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.120
 army at school 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.649
 neither do the ten plus 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.879
 beards 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 Assumption please is one for all 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.180
 soy 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.800
 and we are forming a way to 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.260
 act behave to speak for 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.570
 consequently we communicate react 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.850
 even get dressed as we are sensitive 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.950
 by our nature to influence us 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.350
 of the environment that surrounds us and here is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.970
 where this factor takes power because 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.070
 we do not have the willpower to 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.440
 avoid it and we have several levels to 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 be able to notice what we put as an example 1 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.810
 burgos I am and in Christian you are a 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.970
 guy who does not have vices does not have 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.619
 idioms is very well educated and always 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.720
 he fulfills his tasks and his duties 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.910
 but on a certain occasion you start to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.270
 relate to people because it is not 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.940
 gorrito natural environment where 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.640
 go so fast to the radio 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.430

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.100
 meat high well carnal the church and is 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.159
 all good but then go a little while 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.990
 with me to be a truth file 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.509
 this jointly if you are speaking in 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.840
 your life, I do not like to rule out how you think 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.399
 I can this when you bring carnal as soon as 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.770

 nothing more I bring my tithe also with 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 you want to spend with me not 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.030

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.280

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.330

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.200
 but we'll keep running 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.940
 quiet because idioms then I 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.769
 I arrived with the people who need 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.750

 I like to dress more daughter so that's the 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.900
 band of the day so the situation already 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:05.049
 T-shirt street 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.120

 calm and here we live as they came 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.909
 people treat you and after all these 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.980
 factors is when we should do the 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.470
 million question the environment where 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.720
 I am pablo is changing 1st of 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.099
 Corinthians 9 speaks more or less what 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.470
 I want to get to this point and the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.959
 chapter 20 to 23 in the see about 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.849
 certain changes or ways you had to 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.680
 dock for the place where I was with 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.780
 the people that were but they believe that the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.480
 environment did not pollute the in the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.159
 Chapter 23 he explains very well why 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.040
 is doing it do not read them the 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.870
 verses for you two to search 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.359
 and this is the most important question in 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.250
 what atmosphere are you relating to 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.079

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 early samples the fruits of what 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.950
 It is the place to feel and you realize that 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.379
 you are living a double or triple life 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.520

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.010
 in the church there 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.780
 the environment changes you and if you do not change the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.000
 environment where you are because we are 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.980
