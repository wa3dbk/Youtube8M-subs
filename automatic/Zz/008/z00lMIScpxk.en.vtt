this<00:01:15.869> time<00:01:16.109> around<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.679> inspiration<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
this time around my inspiration for the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.440 
this time around my inspiration for the
music<00:01:17.969> came<00:01:18.149> from<00:01:19.490> mainly<00:01:20.490> Chinese<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
music came from mainly Chinese and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.849 
music came from mainly Chinese and
Japanese<00:01:21.659> folk<00:01:22.649> music<00:01:23.750> for<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:24.990> been<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
Japanese folk music for me it's been a

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.160 
Japanese folk music for me it's been a
very<00:01:25.920> different<00:01:26.579> experience<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
very different experience and I think it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:41.260 
very different experience and I think it
can<00:01:28.319> be<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.469> very<00:01:28.530> interesting<00:01:28.979> school

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.870 

the<00:01:42.270> visuals<00:01:42.480> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> game<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.370> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the visuals of the game and the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.770 
the visuals of the game and the
storyline<00:01:45.450> has<00:01:45.780> played<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.410> huge<00:01:46.530> part<00:01:47.570> well<00:01:48.570> as

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
storyline has played a huge part well as

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.480 
storyline has played a huge part well as
an<00:01:48.930> inspirational<00:01:49.590> source<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.160> me<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
an inspirational source for me when I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
an inspirational source for me when I
write<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.910> music<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.720> many<00:01:51.840> things

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
write the music there are so many things

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.670 
write the music there are so many things
in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> game<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.010> really<00:01:53.340> evokes<00:01:54.240> feelings

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
in the game that really evokes feelings

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.600 
in the game that really evokes feelings
and<00:01:55.790> musical<00:01:56.870> ideas<00:01:58.100> perhaps<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.340> should<00:01:59.370> do

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and musical ideas perhaps we should do

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
and musical ideas perhaps we should do
this<00:01:59.760> one<00:01:59.970> test<00:02:00.210> okay<00:02:00.390> from<00:02:00.840> start<00:02:01.200> from<00:02:01.350> C<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
this one test okay from start from C and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:14.020 
this one test okay from start from C and
then<00:02:02.100> we'll<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.550> other<00:02:02.700> ones

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:25.650 

you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:40.180 

you

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.380 

one<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.340> things<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:41.700> really<00:02:41.940> wanted<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
one of the things we really wanted to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.699 
one of the things we really wanted to
capture<00:02:42.630> with<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.990> expansion<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.590> that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
capture with the expansion was that

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.040 
capture with the expansion was that
sense<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.190> exploration<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.810> time<00:02:45.990> around

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
sense of exploration so this time around

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.990 
sense of exploration so this time around
the<00:02:46.380> play<00:02:46.590> fields<00:02:46.980> are<00:02:47.100> much<00:02:47.370> more<00:02:47.670> open

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the play fields are much more open

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.090 
the play fields are much more open
they're<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.930> largest<00:02:49.230> playfields<00:02:49.980> that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
they're the largest playfields that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.130 
they're the largest playfields that
we've<00:02:50.250> created<00:02:50.490> yet<00:02:51.030> for<00:02:51.330> age<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.569> conan<00:02:51.750> so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
we've created yet for age of conan so

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.930 
we've created yet for age of conan so
the<00:02:52.230> player<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.280> able<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.640> get

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the player will really be able to get

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.540 
the player will really be able to get
that's<00:02:54.239> fat<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.810> sense<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.319> an<00:02:55.550> expansive

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
that's fat that sense of an expansive

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.490 
that's fat that sense of an expansive
location<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.270> they<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:57.720> spend<00:02:58.170> time

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
location that they can really spend time

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.710 
location that they can really spend time
exploring<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.850> while<00:03:00.090> some<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.569> play

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
exploring so while some of the play

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.050 
exploring so while some of the play
fields<00:03:01.080> in<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.230> original<00:03:01.470> game<00:03:02.000> they<00:03:03.000> were

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
fields in the original game they were

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
fields in the original game they were
more<00:03:03.420> linear<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:04.260> we've<00:03:04.410> tried<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.739> create<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
more linear here we've tried to create a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.890 
more linear here we've tried to create a
feeling<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.209> player<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.600> really

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
feeling that the player can really

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660 
feeling that the player can really
travel<00:03:07.170> from<00:03:07.440> one<00:03:07.590> end<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.950> guitar<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
travel from one end of guitar to the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.759 
travel from one end of guitar to the
other<00:03:08.819> through<00:03:09.420> these<00:03:09.570> massive<00:03:10.230> playfield

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
other through these massive playfield

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.890 
other through these massive playfield
regions<00:03:11.160> which<00:03:11.670> will<00:03:11.880> really<00:03:12.120> open<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
regions which will really open up the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.660 
regions which will really open up the
world<00:03:13.110> for<00:03:13.380> them<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.769> allow<00:03:14.190> them<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.519> get

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
world for them and allow them to get

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.460 
world for them and allow them to get
this<00:03:14.940> sense<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.480> they're<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:16.230> really

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
this sense that they're there really

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.090 
this sense that they're there really
exploring<00:03:16.920> these<00:03:17.220> strange<00:03:17.580> new<00:03:17.760> lands
