00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
rpoe built-in for this demonstration I'm

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.880 
rpoe built-in for this demonstration I'm
using<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.839> MBR<00:00:16.139> 32-channel<00:00:16.740> peña<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.890> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
using an MBR 32-channel peña and to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
using an MBR 32-channel peña and to
start<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.390> just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
start up what I'm have to do is just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.070 
start up what I'm have to do is just
connect<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> camera<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.640> PIO<00:00:23.880> II<00:00:24.080> once

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
connect the camera to the PIO II once

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.130 
connect the camera to the PIO II once
it's<00:00:25.289> connected<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.949> MBR<00:00:26.609> will<00:00:27.000> power<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it's connected the MBR will power up the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.279 
it's connected the MBR will power up the
camera<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.949> p<00:00:29.220> OE<00:00:29.750> enable<00:00:30.750> camera<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
camera if it's a p OE enable camera and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.450 
camera if it's a p OE enable camera and
it<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:32.070> assign<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.940> IP<00:00:33.059> address<00:00:34.460> randomly

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it will assign an IP address randomly

plugged in into the p OE are going to be

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
plugged in into the p OE are going to be

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
plugging into the p OE h side you will

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
plugging into the p OE h side you will
not<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.850> able<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.180> access<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.079> the

not be able to access it from the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980 
not be able to access it from the
network<00:02:04.549> instead<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.820> will<00:02:05.969> access<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> NVR

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
network instead you will access the NVR

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.249 
network instead you will access the NVR
and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.429> will<00:02:08.670> manage<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.810> camera

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and then you will manage the camera

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.470 
and then you will manage the camera
itself<00:02:10.500> from<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> MBR

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480
