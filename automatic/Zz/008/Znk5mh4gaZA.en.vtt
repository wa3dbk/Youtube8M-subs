 koblenzer oberwerth are long gone 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.639

 Season preparation with asterisks 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.880
 the fc, however, far from in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.900
 koblenz with a full squad 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.929
 aground 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.489

 cologne was presented 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.289
 just a few names of those not included 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.149
 the fc were still in the first 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 half-time and surprisingly little against 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.289
 a completely reformed tus eleven the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.180
 clearly better team but and that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.100
 either marvel or you arrange it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 in the category is just a test game 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.960
 1 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 the federal league made it in half 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 one did not make a hit 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 a well-stocked koblenzer knew that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.890
 schlussmann fabrice vollborn successful 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.740
 to prevent 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 in the second half, the 4600 hope 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 spectators at the first gates 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.600
 For comparison at the end of the season before 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.119
 lost against bayer leverkusen in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 a friendship game with 1 to 6 with 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.610
 But they were at this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.159
 economical evening 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 it should stay at 0 0 which is quite 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.509
 as an exclamation point from tus koblenz too 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 it is clear that you did not play the fc 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.869
 On the wall but you had with one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 very good defensive order 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.090
 at least one draw 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.610
 wrested 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.110
 tactically disciplined compact stood 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.000
 that also praised after the game 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.759
 tus-trainer evangelos net from the of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.390
 2002 to 2004 even played for the FC 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.820
 would have 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 But metsos also warned we have to 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 let church in the village 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.159

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.060
 organized regional league stÃ¶ger 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.799
 his team would have been in half 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.899
 One must take advantage of the opportunities 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.070
 For that he would have to play with his players 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.350
 Consequence in conclusion 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.969
 under the line also without gates 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 entertaining game for the spectators 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.500
 on the top and for both teams 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.149
 there are still some homework ahead 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.590
 it then for tus koblenz on the second 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.170
