00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the road and then you have the two best

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.479 
the road and then you have the two best
arguably<00:00:49.739> two<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.070> best<00:00:50.190> teams<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.429> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
arguably two of the best teams in the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.889 
arguably two of the best teams in the
big<00:00:50.640> ten<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> rest<00:00:51.089> of<00:00:51.179> the<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.359> so<00:00:51.660> who<00:00:51.780> knows

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
big ten the rest of the way so who knows

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.970 
big ten the rest of the way so who knows
if<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> slide<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.679> happen<00:00:52.920> again

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
if the slide is going to happen again

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
if the slide is going to happen again
and<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> slide<00:00:54.239> happens<00:00:54.539> again<00:00:54.719> who<00:00:54.929> knows

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and if a slide happens again who knows

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
and if a slide happens again who knows
what<00:00:55.230> happens<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.559> his<00:00:55.710> status<00:00:55.920> so

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
what happens with his status so

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.099 
what happens with his status so
therefore<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:57.210> why<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> most

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
therefore that's why i think is the most

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
therefore that's why i think is the most
credit<00:00:58.409> payment<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.800> tenure<00:00:59.100> he<00:00:59.280> has<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.519> win

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
credit payment is tenure he has to win

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
credit payment is tenure he has to win
to<00:00:59.699> show<00:00:59.879> he<00:00:59.999> can<00:01:00.089> right<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> ship<00:01:00.390> i<00:01:00.809> agree

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to show he can right the ship i agree

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
to show he can right the ship i agree
with<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.589> that<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.269> similar<00:01:03.269> setup<00:01:03.659> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
with you that this is a similar setup to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
with you that this is a similar setup to
last<00:01:04.320> year<00:01:04.589> where<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> Wolverines<00:01:05.309> went<00:01:05.550> on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
last year where the Wolverines went on

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
last year where the Wolverines went on
that<00:01:05.850> slide<00:01:06.689> thru<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.079> the<00:01:07.140> end<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.470> their<00:01:07.530> Big

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
that slide thru out the end of their Big

that slide thru out the end of their Big

critical<00:01:10.290> game<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.829> his<00:01:10.979> tenure<00:01:11.759> when<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.600> think

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
critical game of his tenure when I think

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
critical game of his tenure when I think
it's<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> very<00:01:13.530> difficult<00:01:13.770> task<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> bring<00:01:14.579> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's a very difficult task to bring a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's a very difficult task to bring a
young<00:01:14.850> team<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> Happy<00:01:15.720> Valley<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.140> expect

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

critical than than this week see that's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.499 
critical than than this week see that's
why<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.399> just<00:01:26.820> disagree<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> there

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.200 
defense is on giving up a ton of yards
against<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.009> team<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.460> shows<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.090> this

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
against this team that shows that this

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
against this team that shows that this
defense<00:01:48.509> isn't<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.810> able<00:01:48.960> stop<00:01:49.109> anybody<00:01:49.350> the

rest<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.859> year<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.490> don't<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
rest of the year well I don't think that

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.990 
rest of the year well I don't think that
there's<00:01:51.479> any<00:01:52.100> expectation<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.369> defense's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
there's any expectation of the defense's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
there's any expectation of the defense's
club<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.359> think<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.289> five<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
club I think well if they go five and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.700 
club I think well if they go five and
seven<00:01:55.979> again<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:57.049> think<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.259> looking<00:01:58.560> too

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
seven again I think you're looking too

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
seven again I think you're looking too
far<00:01:58.920> ahead<00:01:58.979> games<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.179> they're<00:02:00.359> not<00:02:00.509> even<00:02:00.750> at

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
far ahead games that they're not even at

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.569 
far ahead games that they're not even at
at<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:00.990> schedule<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.649> call<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
at the schedule to call this one of the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.849 
at the schedule to call this one of the
most<00:02:02.759> critical<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:03.929> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> have

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
most critical I think you know you have

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.609 
most critical I think you know you have
enough<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.579> number<00:02:06.060> ten<00:02:06.329> scoring<00:02:06.929> offense<00:02:07.320> in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
enough the number ten scoring offense in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
enough the number ten scoring offense in
the<00:02:07.829> big<00:02:07.979> ten<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.460> Penn<00:02:08.640> State<00:02:08.940> number<00:02:09.479> nine

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the big ten is Penn State number nine

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.490 
the big ten is Penn State number nine
scoring<00:02:11.130> defense<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.760> Michigan<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.390> think<00:02:12.900> it's

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
scoring defense is Michigan I think it's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010 
scoring defense is Michigan I think it's
a<00:02:13.620> very<00:02:13.740> even<00:02:14.220> battle<00:02:14.550> between<00:02:14.700> two<00:02:15.330> subpar

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
a very even battle between two subpar

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.470 
a very even battle between two subpar
unit

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
unit

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.860 
unit
in<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.959> respect<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.760> don't<00:02:19.540> think<00:02:19.750> that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
in that respect but I don't think that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.080 
in that respect but I don't think that
this<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.290> any<00:02:20.379> way<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.010> defining<00:02:21.519> moment<00:02:21.700> of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
this in any way is a defining moment of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.910 
this in any way is a defining moment of
riches<00:02:22.690> three<00:02:23.049> or<00:02:23.230> ten<00:02:23.379> year<00:02:23.560> here<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.769> think

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
riches three or ten year here I think

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.949 
riches three or ten year here I think
there's<00:02:24.190> already<00:02:24.310> been<00:02:24.580> more<00:02:24.970> key<00:02:25.569> moments

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
there's already been more key moments

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.960 
there's already been more key moments
than<00:02:26.110> whatever<00:02:26.319> happens<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.340> happy<00:02:27.549> value

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
sense that a Michigan win this week is

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.150 
sense that a Michigan win this week is
probably<00:02:56.260> more<00:02:56.500> important<00:02:57.010> than<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
probably more important than the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.740 
probably more important than the
Michigan<00:02:57.519> loss<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:57.970> far<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.269> whatever<00:02:58.450> it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
Michigan loss as far as whatever it

Michigan loss as far as whatever it
portends<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.500> future<00:02:59.829> but<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:00.700> I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
portends for the future but I think I

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.849 
portends for the future but I think I
still<00:03:01.480> say<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:01.780> michigan<00:03:02.109> state<00:03:02.230> game<00:03:02.379> from<00:03:02.799> a

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
still say the michigan state game from a

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.500 
still say the michigan state game from a
few<00:03:03.099> weeks<00:03:03.129> back<00:03:03.459> was<00:03:03.790> more<00:03:04.030> important<00:03:04.480> than

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
few weeks back was more important than

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.210 
few weeks back was more important than
whatever<00:03:04.720> happens<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.349> game<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.799> what

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
think there's many more games even this

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.699 
think there's many more games even this
season<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.389> are<00:03:22.510> more<00:03:22.630> important<00:03:23.139> in<00:03:23.260> the
