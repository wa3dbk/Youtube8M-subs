from the vehicle he can receive a text

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.770 
from the vehicle he can receive a text
then<00:01:52.610> he<00:01:52.729> knows<00:01:52.910> that<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> alarm<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.630> going

off
he<00:01:54.890> will<00:01:54.979> probably<00:01:55.100> get<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.670> later<00:01:55.940> but

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
he will probably get that on later but
