00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.470
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:10.260
 test a screen on an iphone 5 a screen 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.809
 for example, we bought on ebay 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 to be able to test it before mounting 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.139
 final 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 so we proceed to hold the two 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.150
 small screws on the iphone use me 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 I use friends his loves damn a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.820
 cutter but high school worked perfect so 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.680
 here we will see when we 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.570
 we gently lift the screen in a 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.270
 screen a small plate 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.270
 a small plate with 3 tennis 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.470
 then this one this one here the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.800
 first must know unfair that life 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.660
 it's not loving and so 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.149
 Always always enough 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 tricky to learn do all that 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.910
 not fall in the phone this is a 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.879
 third 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 so we will lift the plate it's this 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.070
 which protects the tablecloths 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 touch lcd 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.530
 camera too 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.240
 here 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.680
 so we access the three tablecloths 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 So when you have tested the screen 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.229
 be aware that there will be only 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.690
 two did to test the lcd tablecloth the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.580
 touch sheet since the tablecloth 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.320
 e 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.690
 2 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.110
 the camera's photo end of 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.760
 facetime you have the registry and then 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.990
 compared to your old screens 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.220
 national 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.950
 so here we are going to chain two 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.600
 tablecloths so think about good phone little 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.280
 lit but by cons when you 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.570
 remove the dance a screen he has to 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.350
 lock up tell themselves they have nothing to 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.259
 see on the screen ditto when you ride the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.259
 on the screen to test it 1 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.350
 always a little tricky to put 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.350
 my 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.960
 this is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 here 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.409
 its good 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.739
 so here we can unlock on the 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.739
 power button is tested and it's perfect 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.030
 everything is working 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.110
 thank you see you soon
