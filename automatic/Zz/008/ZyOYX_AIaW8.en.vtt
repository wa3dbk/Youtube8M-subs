now this eye is much more realistic even

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.920 
now this eye is much more realistic even
though<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.460> still<00:05:03.640> told<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.030> stores<00:05:04.420> it<00:05:04.660> tries

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
though it still told to stores it tries

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.020 
though it still told to stores it tries
to<00:05:04.960> give<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.290> more<00:05:05.590> as<00:05:05.980> you<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:06.610> see<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:06.820> more

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
to give a more as you can see a more

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.670 
to give a more as you can see a more
realistic<00:05:07.240> approach<00:05:07.660> oh<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.050> can<00:05:08.230> take<00:05:08.440> from

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
realistic approach oh we can take from

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.680 
realistic approach oh we can take from
it<00:05:08.830> that's<00:05:09.280> a<00:05:09.430> more<00:05:09.700> contemporary

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
it that's a more contemporary

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.630 
it that's a more contemporary
understanding<00:05:11.620> of<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.890> world<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.520> was

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
understanding of the world that was

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.000 
understanding of the world that was
around<00:05:12.940> them<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.750> for<00:05:13.840> example<00:05:14.260> when<00:05:15.240> the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
around them so for example when the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
around them so for example when the
Renaissance<00:05:18.010> painters<00:05:18.160> clad<00:05:18.580> painted

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
Renaissance painters clad painted

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.510 
Renaissance painters clad painted
classical<00:05:19.600> pieces<00:05:20.110> like<00:05:20.410> Rome<00:05:20.680> Greece<00:05:21.100> they

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
classical pieces like Rome Greece they

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.220 
classical pieces like Rome Greece they
painted<00:05:21.910> it<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:22.120> Renaissance<00:05:22.720> armor<00:05:23.080> even

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
painted it in Renaissance armor even

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.810 
painted it in Renaissance armor even
though<00:05:23.410> Greek<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:23.890> Roman<00:05:23.980> was<00:05:24.310> nothing<00:05:24.640> like

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
though Greek and Roman was nothing like

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.910 
though Greek and Roman was nothing like
that<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:25.600> what<00:05:25.810> you've<00:05:25.960> got<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.170> contemporary

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
that so what you've got is contemporary

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.400 
that so what you've got is contemporary
people<00:05:27.240> painting<00:05:28.240> what<00:05:28.480> they<00:05:28.630> think<00:05:29.080> the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
shinobi look like but where they should

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.180 
shinobi look like but where they should

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
course they were contemporary remember

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.550

the shinobi are active right until 1850s

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.500 
the shinobi are active right until 1850s
at<00:05:38.680> least<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.430> we<00:05:39.670> know<00:05:39.850> this<00:05:40.060> we<00:05:40.480> know

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
at least and we know this we know

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.580 
at least and we know this we know
they're<00:05:40.840> not<00:05:41.020> as<00:05:41.230> good<00:05:41.380> as<00:05:41.470> their

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
they're not as good as their

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.630 
they're not as good as their
counterparts<00:05:42.070> well<00:05:42.160> we<00:05:42.250> know<00:05:42.370> that<00:05:42.400> they

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
counterparts well we know that they

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.670 
counterparts well we know that they
change<00:05:43.060> but<00:05:43.540> we<00:05:43.630> do<00:05:43.810> know<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.170> shouldn't<00:05:44.620> all

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
change but we do know that shouldn't all

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.230 
change but we do know that shouldn't all
be<00:05:44.710> were<00:05:45.100> in<00:05:45.340> existence<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.910> we're<00:05:46.030> being

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
be were in existence and we're being

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.560 
be were in existence and we're being
used<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:47.200> when<00:05:47.410> they're<00:05:48.190> at<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.430> time<00:05:48.700> they're

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
used so when they're at the time they're

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.640 
used so when they're at the time they're
being<00:05:49.660> used<00:05:49.780> there<00:05:50.200> in<00:05:50.350> there

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.770 

so<00:05:55.650> what<00:05:55.950> can<00:05:56.070> we<00:05:56.130> conclude

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
so what can we conclude

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.990 
so what can we conclude
really<00:05:57.139> what<00:05:57.290> can<00:05:57.410> we<00:05:57.500> conclude<00:05:57.820> we<00:05:58.820> can

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
really what can we conclude we can

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.610 
really what can we conclude we can
conclude<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.420> in<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.660> Sengoku<00:05:59.930> period<00:06:00.110> we

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
conclude that in the Sengoku period we

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.340 
conclude that in the Sengoku period we
can<00:06:00.830> pretty<00:06:01.340> much<00:06:01.400> say<00:06:01.790> that<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.840> ninja<00:06:03.170> mask

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
can pretty much say that the ninja mask

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.570 
can pretty much say that the ninja mask
wasn't<00:06:03.710> known<00:06:03.860> or<00:06:04.040> which<00:06:04.160> couldn't<00:06:04.490> really

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
wasn't known or which couldn't really

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.510 
wasn't known or which couldn't really
come<00:06:04.760> across<00:06:04.880> him<00:06:05.440> we<00:06:06.440> can<00:06:06.650> say<00:06:06.889> in<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.190> adult

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
come across him we can say in the adult

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.070 
come across him we can say in the adult
period<00:06:07.970> that<00:06:08.300> there<00:06:08.540> exists<00:06:09.350> actual<00:06:10.250> Gammons

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
period that there exists actual Gammons

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.110 
period that there exists actual Gammons
actual<00:06:12.080> ninja<00:06:12.410> masks<00:06:12.710> in<00:06:12.800> various<00:06:13.220> forms<00:06:13.669> they

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
actual ninja masks in various forms they

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.430 
actual ninja masks in various forms they
were<00:06:14.210> not<00:06:14.330> called<00:06:14.630> ninja<00:06:14.900> masks<00:06:15.080> of<00:06:15.200> course

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
were not called ninja masks of course

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.650 
were not called ninja masks of course
they<00:06:15.530> were<00:06:15.590> just<00:06:15.770> masks<00:06:16.310> but<00:06:17.090> they<00:06:17.180> were<00:06:17.240> used

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
they were just masks but they were used

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.840 
they were just masks but they were used
and<00:06:17.870> they<00:06:17.930> were<00:06:18.050> used<00:06:18.230> by<00:06:18.410> people<00:06:18.470> who<00:06:19.400> didn't

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
and they were used by people who didn't

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.430 
and they were used by people who didn't
want<00:06:20.150> people<00:06:20.480> to<00:06:20.780> know<00:06:20.900> what<00:06:20.990> they<00:06:21.110> were<00:06:21.200> doing

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
want people to know what they were doing

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.190 
want people to know what they were doing
