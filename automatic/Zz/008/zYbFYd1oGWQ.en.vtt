my<00:00:15.769> name<00:00:15.950> is<00:00:16.039> dr.<00:00:16.309> Tammy<00:00:16.520> Miller<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.090> I<00:00:17.240> was

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
my name is dr. Tammy Miller and I was

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.510 
my name is dr. Tammy Miller and I was
here<00:00:17.570> evaluating<00:00:18.110> Zeus<00:00:18.380> he<00:00:18.949> was<00:00:19.099> rescued

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
here evaluating Zeus he was rescued

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.370 
here evaluating Zeus he was rescued
about<00:00:19.699> six<00:00:20.000> months<00:00:20.300> ago<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.720> we<00:00:20.779> knew<00:00:21.110> he<00:00:21.289> had

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
about six months ago and we knew he had

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.290 
about six months ago and we knew he had
an<00:00:21.529> eye<00:00:21.619> problem<00:00:22.039> at<00:00:22.189> that<00:00:22.310> point<00:00:22.610> we<00:00:23.180> were

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
an eye problem at that point we were

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.880 
an eye problem at that point we were
kind<00:00:23.329> of<00:00:23.599> we've<00:00:24.020> looked<00:00:24.230> into<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.470> few<00:00:24.529> times

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
kind of we've looked into a few times

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.950 
kind of we've looked into a few times
through<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.279> cage<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:25.939> I'm<00:00:26.360> determined<00:00:26.689> that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
through the cage and I'm determined that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.170 
through the cage and I'm determined that
he<00:00:27.200> had<00:00:27.410> multiple<00:00:28.340> problems<00:00:28.789> with<00:00:29.000> that<00:00:29.119> eye

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
he had multiple problems with that eye

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.120 
he had multiple problems with that eye
we<00:00:29.869> were<00:00:29.989> trying<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.380> see<00:00:30.680> what<00:00:31.009> was

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
we were trying to see what was

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.460 
we were trying to see what was
potentially<00:00:31.580> the<00:00:31.640> best<00:00:31.910> thing<00:00:32.150> to<00:00:32.180> remedy<00:00:33.170> him

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
potentially the best thing to remedy him

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.400 
potentially the best thing to remedy him
and<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.030> think<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.449> main<00:00:35.660> discomfort

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
and but we think the main discomfort

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.869 
and but we think the main discomfort
that<00:00:36.530> he's<00:00:36.680> experiencing<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.430> he<00:00:37.610> had<00:00:37.699> a<00:00:37.730> very

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
that he's experiencing is he had a very

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.270 
that he's experiencing is he had a very
large<00:00:38.210> corneal<00:00:38.900> ulcer<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.500> has<00:00:39.920> not<00:00:40.100> been

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
large corneal ulcer that has not been

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.500 
large corneal ulcer that has not been
healing<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.820> has<00:00:40.910> probably<00:00:41.180> been<00:00:41.300> sitting

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
healing it has probably been sitting

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.720 
healing it has probably been sitting
there<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:41.839> awhile<00:00:42.080> we<00:00:42.980> decided<00:00:43.370> just<00:00:43.400> to

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
there for awhile we decided just to

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.579 
there for awhile we decided just to
address<00:00:43.940> his<00:00:44.210> cornea<00:00:44.600> today<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.260> see<00:00:45.410> if<00:00:45.500> we

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
address his cornea today and see if we

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.439 
address his cornea today and see if we
can<00:00:45.710> get<00:00:45.829> it<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.010> heal<00:00:46.309> we<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:47.180> want<00:00:47.330> to<00:00:47.390> make

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
can get it to heal we just want to make

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.479 
can get it to heal we just want to make
sure<00:00:47.510> he's<00:00:47.780> not<00:00:47.900> in<00:00:48.049> any<00:00:48.199> pain<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.220> we<00:00:49.339> did

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
sure he's not in any pain and so we did

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.219 
sure he's not in any pain and so we did
a<00:00:49.519> special<00:00:49.790> procedure<00:00:50.059> where<00:00:50.449> we<00:00:50.600> bird<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
a special procedure where we bird the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.840 
a special procedure where we bird the
surface<00:00:51.559> of<00:00:51.710> his<00:00:51.769> cornea<00:00:52.190> with<00:00:52.339> a<00:00:52.369> diamond

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
surface of his cornea with a diamond

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.090 
surface of his cornea with a diamond
Burr<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.239> we're<00:00:54.140> hoping<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.710> will<00:00:54.860> get

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
Burr and we're hoping that that will get

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.680 
Burr and we're hoping that that will get
that<00:00:55.220> ulcer<00:00:55.519> to<00:00:55.640> heal<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.059> then<00:00:56.239> while<00:00:56.390> he<00:00:56.570> was

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
that ulcer to heal and then while he was

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.180 
that ulcer to heal and then while he was
under<00:00:56.869> anesthesia<00:00:57.229> he<00:00:57.409> obviously<00:00:57.559> had<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:57.920> full

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
under anesthesia he obviously had a full

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.520 
under anesthesia he obviously had a full
physical<00:00:58.369> exam<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.180> we<00:00:59.239> drew<00:00:59.420> blood<00:00:59.600> work<00:00:59.869> so

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
physical exam and we drew blood work so

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.869 
physical exam and we drew blood work so
we<00:01:00.650> know<00:01:00.799> how<00:01:00.979> his<00:01:01.070> kidneys<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.580> liver<00:01:01.820> and

want them to be attempting to breed
that's<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.510> main<00:01:23.660> reason<00:01:23.960> he<00:01:23.990> was<00:01:24.170> neutered

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
reason we're doing that is he has spent

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.260
