 Self-promotion we are on the upload 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.610
 point net left gone and are because 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530
 now the microserver h 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 17.53 mb is the big start 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.430
 easy on current waiting time 30 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.809
 seconds on the free download and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.670
 then he puts this after 30 seconds 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 get down and we get this file 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.770
 this detailed that is the zip file 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.810
 and you can now open it with winrar 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 and the link to the with land program we 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 which of course is free is below 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.890
 am nice video description we open 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.890
 all the time and you see we have 33 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.140
 files once the power once the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.600
 city file and once the eula we 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.509
 first create a new folder 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.340
 call it when the server and drag 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.950
 the three files quite simply in folder 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 so that in the park the zip file 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 go to the normal files so now 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.290
 Let's go to the aula you have to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.659
 namely agree because minecraft the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.729
 has changed that us something like agbs and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.439
 they would like to read through you first and 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.689
 then set up here still added 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.720
 and then we can use the server completely 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.759
 Just like that, I'm quite 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.740
 Just start with the city 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.670
 double-click on it we see that it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.820
 also a sportversion in the c so 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.340
 ie it is not an official powerhouse 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.869
 version and you can see the new items 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.759
 not yet use they are indeed in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.050
 the list when in game mode but 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.209
 you can not use either because 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.580
 it is not yet a quartet is it 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.700
 just because that on the 1 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.690
 point off 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.160
 you have to be mentioned again 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.080
 Now many folders will be here 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.120
 created a lot of files created something 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.410
 just a server so we go in 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.030
 my minecraft 1 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.390
 let's go to multiplayer and now 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.420
 you have to delete the server 10 times 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.810
 I have to say the two here again 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.310
 you enter your servers so your and 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.450
 that's on your server on the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.769
 Doppelhaus so the ip is local post 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.600
 that's just because the server 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.840
 hosted on your pc 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.769
 that is just the common the usual ip 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.940
 where he does that on this local 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.040
 ok we are lined and we see that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.080
 is the 1.8 we can now here for 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.220
 For example sometimes give the op order 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.380
 Everyone will see how it works 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.660
 Simply in the console op e mails 90,000 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.900
 enter so your name is then 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.540
 here also konsole en 590 then can us 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.709
 again give very short game mode and 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.690
 then I show you that it is the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.010
 new things but you can just 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.630
 do not use here for example rabbit 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.100
 with if I you down in the bar 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.040
 grabbed it disappears down here again 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.640
 immediately so the whole thing is still working 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.950
 not right 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.450
 but how could you be with the 1.8 and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.980
 that's something and this one 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.930
 Grief is for example in stone 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.310
 but it does not matter what you can do 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.620
 you can download the whole with 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.470
 your friends on the 1.8 play and 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.120
 if then the normal forces version 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.910
 Of course you can also go outside 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.470
 Use the new teams and that's it 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.090
 already with the video I'm out of the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.910
 whole lower left in the biological 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.569
 video description i am chaos to the 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.569
