going<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> show<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.299> how<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.750> make<00:03:16.260> my<00:03:16.680> solution

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
going to show you how I make my solution

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.410 
going to show you how I make my solution
of<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:19.769> my<00:03:19.920> rinse<00:03:20.160> now<00:03:20.489> one<00:03:21.000> thing<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.239> I

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
of for my rinse now one thing that I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.289 
of for my rinse now one thing that I
started<00:03:21.750> adding<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:23.430> my<00:03:23.910> solution<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:26.299> baking

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
started adding to my solution is baking

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.020 
started adding to my solution is baking
soda<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.290> reason<00:03:28.680> for<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.280> my

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
soda and the reason for that is my

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.830 
soda and the reason for that is my
dentist<00:03:30.510> told<00:03:30.720> me<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.579> you<00:03:32.579> know<00:03:32.840> what

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
dentist told me that you know what

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.910 
dentist told me that you know what
really<00:03:34.440> contributes<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.579> cavities<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.920> acid

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
really contributes to cavities is acid

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
really contributes to cavities is acid
in<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.760> mouth<00:03:38.940> because<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.750> know<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.170> a

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
in the mouth because you know I have a

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.319 
in the mouth because you know I have a
few<00:03:40.440> cavities<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.310> didn't<00:03:41.640> understand<00:03:42.090> why

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
few cavities and I didn't understand why

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.509 
few cavities and I didn't understand why
it<00:03:42.390> happened<00:03:42.900> because<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.410> don't<00:03:43.709> drink

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
it happened because I don't drink

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.569 
it happened because I don't drink
you<00:03:44.910> know<00:03:45.030> sugary<00:03:45.980> things<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.160> don't<00:03:47.370> drink

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
you know sugary things I don't drink

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.300 
you know sugary things I don't drink
sodas<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> don't<00:03:48.540> eat<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> lot<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.620> sweets<00:03:50.100> and

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
sodas I don't eat a lot of sweets and

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.180 
sodas I don't eat a lot of sweets and
things<00:03:50.609> like<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.109> but<00:03:52.109> still<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.500> have<00:03:52.829> you

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
things like that but still I have you

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.960 
things like that but still I have you
know<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> couple<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.820> cavities<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:55.700> it's<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
know a couple of cavities and it's the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.150 
know a couple of cavities and it's the
acid<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.780> we<00:03:57.930> all<00:03:58.049> have<00:03:58.260> bacteria<00:03:58.950> in

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
acid you know we all have bacteria in

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.610 
acid you know we all have bacteria in
our<00:03:59.549> mouths<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.420> bacteria<00:04:00.989> feed<00:04:01.290> on

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
our mouths and the bacteria feed on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.620 
our mouths and the bacteria feed on
carbohydrates<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:03.650> they<00:04:04.670> excrete<00:04:05.670> acid<00:04:06.450> and

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
carbohydrates and they excrete acid and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.759 
carbohydrates and they excrete acid and
it's<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.410> acid<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:08.870> erodes<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.140> enamel<00:04:10.620> in

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
it's the acid that erodes the enamel in

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.410 
it's the acid that erodes the enamel in
your<00:04:10.920> teeth<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.370> leads<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.880> cavities

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
your teeth that leads to cavities

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.949 
your teeth that leads to cavities
so<00:04:12.829> baking<00:04:13.829> soda<00:04:14.160> actually<00:04:14.959> neutralizes

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
so baking soda actually neutralizes

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.590 
so baking soda actually neutralizes
those<00:04:16.799> acids<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.669> after<00:04:18.180> every<00:04:18.510> meal<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:20.600> will

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
those acids so after every meal I will

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.320 
those acids so after every meal I will
rinse<00:04:22.079> with<00:04:22.530> some<00:04:22.830> baking<00:04:23.190> soda<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.760> water

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
rinse with some baking soda and water

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.630 
rinse with some baking soda and water
and<00:04:24.659> water<00:04:25.169> is<00:04:25.409> a<00:04:25.440> good<00:04:25.710> thing<00:04:25.860> also<00:04:26.130> just

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
and water is a good thing also just

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.280 
and water is a good thing also just
water<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:27.120> itself

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
water of itself

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.580 
water of itself
to<00:04:28.410> neutralize<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:30.240> acid<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:32.690> take<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
to neutralize the acid so I take just a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.310 
to neutralize the acid so I take just a
little<00:04:35.280> bit<00:04:37.280> maybe<00:04:38.280> like<00:04:38.750> quarter<00:04:39.750> teaspoon

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
little bit maybe like quarter teaspoon

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.280 
little bit maybe like quarter teaspoon
of<00:04:40.860> baking<00:04:41.850> soda<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:44.120> I'll<00:04:45.120> put<00:04:45.390> that<00:04:45.420> in<00:04:45.960> a

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
of baking soda and I'll put that in a

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.980 
of baking soda and I'll put that in a
container<00:04:46.980> usually<00:04:47.640> I<00:04:47.670> use<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.940> cup<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:48.930> you

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
container usually I use a cup but so you
