00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
sensor for the airflow sensor as you can

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.680 
sensor for the airflow sensor as you can
see<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.010> disconnect<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.940> shut<00:01:57.660> the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
see and it's disconnect it so shut the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.710 
see and it's disconnect it so shut the
ignition<00:01:58.080> off<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.530> can't<00:01:58.800> reset<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
ignition off in that can't reset it and

the light will be off you fix the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.460 
the light will be off you fix the
problem<00:02:02.540> that's<00:02:03.540> how<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.050> scanner

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
problem that's how you use the scanner

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.690 
problem that's how you use the scanner
by<00:02:04.920> testing<00:02:05.370> check<00:02:05.520> engine<00:02:05.760> codes<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.570> also

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
by testing check engine codes and also

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.460 
by testing check engine codes and also
go<00:02:08.700> descriptions<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.630> will<00:02:09.780> also<00:02:09.930> find<00:02:10.290> them
