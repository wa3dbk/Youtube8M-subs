00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the circuit city hand protector 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.269
 I recommend that you producers send 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.240
 50 and actor of the team in a cg 150 fans of him 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.099
 it's 2013 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 I got the bike zero and had to change 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.990
 the handlebars to be able to adapt and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.080
 support you know but he is very good 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.060
 very good adaptation is ball show 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.670
 there are other things I had put a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 yellow before our top of the line 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 only unfortunately he was coming off the bike 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.600
 I ended up discreet and I ended up breaking 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 I had to put a new pair in. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.890
 so he just had black in the store 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.719
 at the time of buying then but still 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.230
 I recommend this to you, here you avoid 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:48.079
 which is to protect a lot in relation to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 contaminants that you hold in your hand 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.920
 any pebble that flies in the car 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 front and truck will have any 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.059
 thing that comes directly to your 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.820
 Hand me, and you're the most protected in the world. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.640
 safety a motorcycle comes out winning is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.409
 Another thing I want to talk about is that if you 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.549
 For putting this one you have to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.960
 remember that you have to change the script 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.530
 original they come with weight here 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.659
 within the weight here in 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.700
 What is this, you can not go in there? 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.560
 inside you go in here is to take a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 super an adapter without it inside you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.570
 have to stick the fist discipline and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.009
 put the computer inside the script 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.790
 original does not allow it to have the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.710
 feet on the handlebars parallel to the tld 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.150
 are traveling here everything is the dgs sport 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 treatment I think there is a quality not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.380
 I do not like it but anyway it's 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.680
 it's a good thing 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 very very efficient it is only one 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.820
 detail for those people who like 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 to wear that shirt to protect 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.619
 the rain cold is not a shirt 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.380
 it goes here so that it comes here and 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.000
 put your hand in here so know if 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 Do you want to choose to put this here? 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.219
 and you will not be able to wear the shirt anymore 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.820
 once I tried to put it stayed 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.310
 pressed here in the south 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.690
 the commands here are not to the point of not 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.490
 get access with your finger understand 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.580
 because she has no more slack when she does not 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.700
 has this right ac adapter does not have the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.440
 producer demand tim circus there is that 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.910
 that shirt service erc understood to give 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.950
 certain to provide all things alone. 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.030
 What with the one who does not date just to warn 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.930
 for you huh 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.930
 It's what I have to say.
