00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.880
 and welcome people to one more 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.559
 video of laine cannabis in this video 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.440
 We are doing a review of one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.900
 sound card series rogue sonar 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.869
 asus fbolms 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 this from here the sound card itself as already 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.480
 I mentioned it's a hot zone it was 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 formalized with some to question a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 old series already asus 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.219
 only this is a zone of the rock series 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 so it's even better than what you 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.880
 already knew by sonar 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.250
 You can see she comes here with the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.230
 The rogue seal itself comes with a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.340
 cape all stylish participation and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.210
 interface can see the interface well 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 complete there of gatec 7.1 without any type 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 problem and all connectors with 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.859
 Except this one that I'm going to explain 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 For what they serve they are gold plated. 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:05.040
 touch connection of pci express better 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.060
 that temporal connection of today and as a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 her special feature is she comes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.820
 she needs is a feed of 6 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.869
 pins to be connected interestingly 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 huh 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.600
 It must be pretty strong, where it's good to be. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.820
 people start with the accessories part 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 it first of all this connection 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.000
 people are losing out here is a 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.360
 audio connection, it came as 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.909
 p2 because it comes with a zinho adapter 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 you're seeing that you go to the place he 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.979
 here and there it will give you the logical output 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 so you can call there in your view or 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.170
 from our TV or anywhere that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.180
 You have this type of connection and this 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.869
 here is the special controller that comes 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.270
 along with it is that plugin in p2 that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.700
 It was not as beautiful as I mentioned then 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.619
 her is exclusive to her too 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 so much so that it even different is not p 20 p 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.759
 Goodbye, for you to call the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 league controller nothing else there 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.590
 The controller here is pretty cool. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 that he does cool 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.500
 but nothing it is a microphone extender and 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.050
 Headset is right for you to leave 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.120
 he's on his desk and does not have to 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.640
 keep going all the time behind your pc 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.950
 to be able to connect yours was to pass 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.349
 all here that is with the symbol of the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.310
 rogue that rotates here is a control of 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.220
 volume 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.190
 're those who have no limit 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.500
 rotation is ok you control the volume 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.340
 it expensive and if you press it 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.510
 he leaves the microphone mute and comes back 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.849
 microphone to normal then someone from 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.540
 Other than that, you can tell 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.700
 but if he has 2 500 ac's he has that 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 control alone he has an adaptation 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.049
 special for noise cancellation cases 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 guarantees up to 50% of noise cancellation 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:11.310
 at the time you are using this 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.769
 I had to cry fbolms when you are 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.379
 using a microphone, you're right. 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.150
 in the head set you're with his microphone 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.049
 Will you be able to do what he's going to do? 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.209
 will create a certain area right around 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.540
 of your miki that he will create a 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.190
 insulation and with a well- 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.720
 smart he'll get out 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.060
 canceling and if these noises and how it is 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.450
 that he will know what your talking is 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.010
 what do you want and why are you here? 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.329
 microphones also exactly this here 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.400
 What are you going to do differently? 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.579
 differentiate what is your voice and what 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.099
 it's just the environment and if you have 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.019
 we speak into a microphone is without a 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.019
 Such a headset should be used only here 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.910
 he will use the two words to 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.450
 make this capture it creates a cone 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.930
 ensure that they work in a 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.389
 angle of 30 degrees where everything you have 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.299
 this year, 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.419
 he will capture and then he will capture only 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.669
 what's inside that icon and will 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.229
 cancel all the rest and that's it guys 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.510
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.430
