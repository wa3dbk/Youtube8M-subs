in middle finger up pull the middle two

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.019 
in middle finger up pull the middle two
chips<00:01:04.570> out<00:01:05.340> exactly<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.399> same<00:01:06.460> way<00:01:06.579> you<00:01:06.729> would

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:07.029 
chips out exactly the same way you would

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:09.599 
chips out exactly the same way you would
in<00:01:07.179> the<00:01:07.270> chip<00:01:07.420> 12<00:01:07.659> object<00:01:08.109> well<00:01:08.520> instead<00:01:09.520> of

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:09.609 
in the chip 12 object well instead of

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.129 
in the chip 12 object well instead of
catching<00:01:09.819> them<00:01:10.029> on<00:01:10.119> your<00:01:10.270> third<00:01:10.479> finger<00:01:10.689> we're

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.139 
catching them on your third finger we're

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:14.459 
catching them on your third finger we're
gonna<00:01:11.289> try<00:01:11.499> and<00:01:11.619> do<00:01:11.740> is<00:01:13.020> catch<00:01:14.020> them<00:01:14.289> between

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
gonna try and do is catch them between

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.480 
gonna try and do is catch them between
those<00:01:15.399> two<00:01:15.609> things<00:01:15.759> like<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:17.249> so<00:01:18.249> if<00:01:18.369> you

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
those two things like that so if you

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.260 
those two things like that so if you
just<00:01:18.639> watch<00:01:18.849> that<00:01:18.880> again<00:01:20.369> pull<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.490> two<00:01:21.939> chips

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
just watch that again pull the two chips

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.489 
just watch that again pull the two chips
out<00:01:22.979> catch<00:01:23.979> them<00:01:24.340> between<00:01:25.179> little<00:01:25.959> Pinky<00:01:26.319> and

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
out catch them between little Pinky and

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.129 
out catch them between little Pinky and
the<00:01:26.590> ring<00:01:26.799> finger<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.630> gonna<00:01:28.749> sail<00:01:28.990> for

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:29.139 
the ring finger this is gonna sail for

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.190 
the ring finger this is gonna sail for
the<00:01:29.170> chip<00:01:29.409> trick<00:01:29.679> so<00:01:30.419> it's<00:01:31.419> part<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.020> middle

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the chip trick so it's part the middle

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.709 
the chip trick so it's part the middle
to<00:01:32.520> catch<00:01:33.520> them<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.090> what<00:01:34.209> you<00:01:34.240> do<00:01:34.359> then<00:01:34.539> is

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
to catch them and what you do then is

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.449 
to catch them and what you do then is
you<00:01:34.749> pull<00:01:34.990> your<00:01:35.109> middle<00:01:35.259> finger<00:01:35.590> through<00:01:35.979> and

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
you pull your middle finger through and

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.179 
you pull your middle finger through and
let<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:36.969> chips<00:01:37.149> touch<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.829> named<00:01:38.979> middle

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
let the chips touch so named middle

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.059 
let the chips touch so named middle
fingers<00:01:39.429> on<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.669> side<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:41.679> reason<00:01:41.889> you<00:01:41.950> do

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
fingers on this side the reason you do

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.289 
fingers on this side the reason you do
this<00:01:42.099> is<00:01:42.249> the<00:01:42.520> middle<00:01:42.819> finger<00:01:42.999> is<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.209> do

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
this is the middle finger is going to do

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.379 
this is the middle finger is going to do
all<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.630> pulling<00:01:43.810> apart<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.139> chips<00:01:44.439> just

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
all the pulling apart the chips just

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
all the pulling apart the chips just
like<00:01:46.389> are<00:01:47.349> you<00:01:47.439> gonna<00:01:47.529> do<00:01:48.090> you're<00:01:49.090> gonna

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
like are you gonna do you're gonna

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.449 
like are you gonna do you're gonna
basically<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.739> middle<00:01:50.979> finger<00:01:51.189> comes<00:01:51.340> back

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
basically the middle finger comes back

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.209 
basically the middle finger comes back
through<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.729> pulls<00:01:51.969> that<00:01:52.209> chip<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:53.219> cause

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
through and pulls that chip out cause

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.999 
through and pulls that chip out cause
this<00:01:54.369> chip<00:01:54.609> out<00:01:54.729> I'll<00:01:55.299> go<00:01:55.479> out<00:01:55.829> whereas<00:01:56.829> your

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
this chip out I'll go out whereas your

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.669 
this chip out I'll go out whereas your
thumb<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.840> head<00:01:58.989> pull<00:01:59.200> them<00:01:59.289> touch<00:01:59.499> it

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
thumb go the head pull them touch it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.929 
thumb go the head pull them touch it
away<00:01:59.829> like<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.520> pull<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.819> back

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
away like that and then you pull it back

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.630 
away like that and then you pull it back
through

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
through

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.610 
through
they'll<00:02:06.540> problem<00:02:06.870> over<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> chip<00:02:07.320> trick<00:02:07.470> in

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
they'll problem over the chip trick in

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.600 
they'll problem over the chip trick in
account<00:02:07.890> Netherlands<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.490> together

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
account Netherlands go out together
