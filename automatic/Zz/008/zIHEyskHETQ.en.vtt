00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.940 
course which starts with a B minor and
there<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.180> play<00:05:18.390> in<00:05:18.450> strings<00:05:18.810> by<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.800> way

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
there you play in strings by the way

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.490 
there you play in strings by the way
it's<00:05:20.130> not<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.310> bar<00:05:20.790> at<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.120> time<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:22.140> you<00:05:22.170> have

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
it's not a bar at this time so you have

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.770 
it's not a bar at this time so you have
here<00:05:22.680> east<00:05:23.040> ring<00:05:23.340> open<00:05:23.790> so<00:05:23.940> actually<00:05:24.390> it's<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.570> B

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
here east ring open so actually it's a B

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.490 
here east ring open so actually it's a B
minor<00:05:25.080> at<00:05:25.320> 11<00:05:25.920> but<00:05:26.190> B<00:05:27.090> minor<00:05:27.360> sounds<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:28.020> whole

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
minor at 11 but B minor sounds a whole

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.100 
minor at 11 but B minor sounds a whole
lot<00:05:28.680> easier<00:05:28.710> so<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.940> have<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.480> open<00:05:30.930> E<00:05:31.080> string

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
lot easier so you have the open E string

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.440 
lot easier so you have the open E string
don't<00:05:31.650> forget<00:05:32.030> then<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.150> play<00:05:33.360> in<00:05:33.600> strings

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:51.250 

open<00:05:39.450> E<00:05:39.570> string<00:05:40.850> then<00:05:48.740> then<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.860> play<00:05:50.100> a

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
open E string then then you play a

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.950 
open E string then then you play a
string<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:53.180> then<00:05:54.180> open<00:05:54.660> D<00:05:55.170> string<00:05:56.960> so

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
string and then open D string so

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:08.330 
string and then open D string so
together

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:24.709 

down<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.520> upstrokes<00:06:11.310> one<00:06:12.419> two<00:06:13.590> three<00:06:14.590> four

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.290 

and<00:06:25.719> when<00:06:25.840> you<00:06:25.960> play<00:06:26.139> that<00:06:26.759> open<00:06:27.759> D<00:06:27.909> string<00:06:27.939> you

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
and when you play that open D string you

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.170 
and when you play that open D string you
can<00:06:28.330> let<00:06:28.629> go<00:06:28.810> of<00:06:28.840> the<00:06:29.080> entire<00:06:29.379> chord<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.860> course

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
can let go of the entire chord of course

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.839 
can let go of the entire chord of course
now<00:06:31.180> that<00:06:31.210> last<00:06:31.599> bar<00:06:31.840> of<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:32.080> chorus<00:06:32.499> is

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
now that last bar of the chorus is

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.879 
now that last bar of the chorus is
exactly<00:06:33.849> the<00:06:34.060> same<00:06:34.330> as<00:06:34.599> the<00:06:35.169> last<00:06:35.379> bar<00:06:35.650> that

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
exactly the same as the last bar that

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.550 
exactly the same as the last bar that
leads<00:06:36.460> to<00:06:36.729> the<00:06:36.849> core<00:06:37.120> so<00:06:37.419> that<00:06:37.449> is<00:06:37.840> that<00:06:38.229> g

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
leads to the core so that is that g

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.170 
leads to the core so that is that g
chord<00:06:40.770> to<00:06:41.770> a

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.830 

simple<00:06:47.110> as<00:06:47.229> that<00:06:48.000> so<00:06:49.000> the<00:06:49.120> entire<00:06:49.360> core<00:06:49.720> is

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
simple as that so the entire core is

00:06:49.840 --> 00:07:15.490 
simple as that so the entire core is
together<00:06:50.490> three<00:06:51.490> four

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:40.600 

not<00:07:16.190> perfect<00:07:16.610> but<00:07:16.730> close<00:07:16.910> enough

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.669
