00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
feature that we introduced last year on

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550 
feature that we introduced last year on
the<00:00:17.850> Genesis<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> diode<00:00:18.990> binding<00:00:19.439> as

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the Genesis and on the diode binding as

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.189 
the Genesis and on the diode binding as
well<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> women's<00:00:20.580> side<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.910> the

escapades and you can see here on the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.740 
escapades and you can see here on the
tongue<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.439> way<00:00:26.250> different<00:00:26.460> design<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:27.150> what

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
tongue a way different design from what

buckle<00:00:30.750> system<00:00:30.920> what<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.520> we

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
buckle system what we do here is we

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
buckle system what we do here is we
separate<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.510> part<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.930> keeps<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.320> into

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
separate the part that keeps you into

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
separate the part that keeps you into
the<00:00:34.710> binding<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.579> part<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.090> gets<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the binding and the part that gets you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
the binding and the part that gets you
into<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> binding<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.500> part<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> concerns<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
into the binding to part the concerns of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.040 
into the binding to part the concerns of
binding<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> top<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.449> with<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> helical

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
binding on the top here with the helical

teeth

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.500 
teeth
and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> part<00:00:41.789> that<00:00:41.969> holds<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.359> the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
with that and the design of the button

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.960 
with that and the design of the button
you<00:00:47.320> get<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.530> featureless<00:00:47.920> called<00:00:48.250> insta<00:00:48.730> click

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
you get a featureless called insta click

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.280 
you get a featureless called insta click
you're<00:00:49.750> engaged<00:00:50.610> instantly<00:00:51.810> other<00:00:52.810> than<00:00:53.050> with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
you're engaged instantly other than with

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.970 

and<00:00:56.179> then<00:00:56.359> into<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.989> helical<00:00:57.440> layout<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.890> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
and then into the helical layout of the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.270 
and then into the helical layout of the
teeth<00:00:59.320> always<00:01:00.320> read<00:01:01.809> faster<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.440> it's<00:01:03.589> twice

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
teeth always read faster so it's twice

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.539 
teeth always read faster so it's twice
as<00:01:04.309> fast<00:01:04.640> nearly<00:01:05.470> twice<00:01:06.470> as<00:01:06.530> safe<00:01:06.890> because<00:01:07.460> he

as fast nearly twice as safe because he

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.499 
as fast nearly twice as safe because he
had<00:01:07.700> less<00:01:07.880> weight

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.350 

separated

just<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.810> suit<00:01:13.990> in<00:01:14.260> store

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
just a suit in store

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.070 
just a suit in store
we<00:01:15.220> made<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.400> modular<00:01:15.940> in<00:01:16.090> Wayne<00:01:19.020> before<00:01:20.020> it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
we made it modular in Wayne before it

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.420 
we made it modular in Wayne before it
was<00:01:20.200> designed<00:01:20.530> together<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.160> hammock

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
was designed together with the hammock

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.330 
was designed together with the hammock
strap<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.810> one<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.140> new<00:01:23.740> modular<00:01:23.980> one

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
strap so this one is a new modular one

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
strap so this one is a new modular one
that<00:01:25.030> we<00:01:25.180> can<00:01:25.390> move<00:01:25.600> down<00:01:26.440> line<00:01:26.740> over<00:01:27.070> time

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that we can move down line over time

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.990 
that we can move down line over time
also<00:01:28.810> nice<00:01:28.960> little<00:01:29.260> feature<00:01:29.380> here<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.850> can

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
see it called out on the hang tag boom

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.350 
see it called out on the hang tag boom
you<00:01:35.410> can<00:01:35.590> see<00:01:35.740> how<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.950> ankle<00:01:36.700> strap<00:01:36.970> holds

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
you can see how the ankle strap holds

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.340 
you can see how the ankle strap holds
away<00:01:37.540> very<00:01:37.720> nicely<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:39.370> just<00:01:40.140> stretch<00:01:41.140> the
