00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
with this little tiny wrinkle which I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.090 
with this little tiny wrinkle which I
think<00:00:32.489> adds<00:00:32.730> character<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.200> okay

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
just going to gently top it not too much

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.380 
just going to gently top it not too much
pressure<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:32.220> dries<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.579> want<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.240> keep

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
pressure as it dries you want to keep

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
pressure as it dries you want to keep
doing<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.409> dries<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> gets<00:01:35.250> harder<00:01:37.880> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
doing it as it dries and gets harder so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.780 
doing it as it dries and gets harder so
I<00:01:39.240> would<00:01:39.600> continue<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> way<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
I would continue on all the way to the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.749 
I would continue on all the way to the
back<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.360> each<00:01:42.630> side<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.320> still<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.430> done

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
back on each side I still have not done

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
back on each side I still have not done
my<00:01:44.970> trip<00:01:45.329> chin<00:01:46.040> as<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.049> I've<00:01:49.290> done<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
my trip chin as you can see I've done a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.760 
my trip chin as you can see I've done a
little<00:01:49.799> boo-boo<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.630> ran<00:01:51.630> short<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> material<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
little boo-boo I ran short of material I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.730 
little boo-boo I ran short of material I
did<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.189> plan<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.549> well<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.200> should<00:01:55.710> be

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
did not plan it well but I should be

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.160 
did not plan it well but I should be
able<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.610> sew<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.570> stretch<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
able when I sew this to stretch this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.850 
able when I sew this to stretch this
enough<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.280> when<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> sew<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.049> bottom<00:02:01.229> piece<00:02:01.619> on

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
enough to when I sew the bottom piece on

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.640 
enough to when I sew the bottom piece on
it<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.850> fun<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:04.009> oops

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
it should be fun but oops

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.040 
it should be fun but oops
but<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.460> should<00:02:07.700> be<00:02:07.820> able<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.240> still<00:02:08.479> save<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
but I should be able to still save that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.590 
but I should be able to still save that
so<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.710> still<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.340> chin<00:02:10.790> down<00:02:10.940> here<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.450> do

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
so I still have the chin down here to do

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.800 
so I still have the chin down here to do
so<00:02:12.560> again<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.340> would<00:02:13.460> put<00:02:13.880> glue<00:02:14.180> all<00:02:14.450> along<00:02:16.810> all

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
so again I would put glue all along all

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.450 
so again I would put glue all along all
along<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.240> onto<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.360> sides<00:02:21.460> generous

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
along here and onto the sides generous

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.750 
along here and onto the sides generous
amount<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.850> glue<00:02:22.910> pull<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.110> over<00:02:24.620> stretch<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
amount of glue pull this over stretch it

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.020 
amount of glue pull this over stretch it
and<00:02:25.940> tap<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.320> glue<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.770> then<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.400> would

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
and tap down the glue and then I would

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.870 
and tap down the glue and then I would
spray<00:02:29.390> glue<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.200> rest<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.740> area<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
spray glue the rest of this area and I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.060 
spray glue the rest of this area and I
