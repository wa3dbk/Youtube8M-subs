at how many awful tanks we have right

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.110 
at how many awful tanks we have right
now<00:02:55.500> stale<00:02:56.480> now<00:02:57.480> these<00:02:57.900> people<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.970> be

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
now stale now these people can be

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.180 
now stale now these people can be
categorized<00:03:00.900> okay<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:01.409> there<00:03:01.769> are<00:03:01.829> people

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
categorized okay so there are people

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.360 
categorized okay so there are people
that<00:03:02.370> leveled<00:03:02.849> up<00:03:02.940> as<00:03:03.180> dps<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.049> switch<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
that leveled up as dps and switch to a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.309 
that leveled up as dps and switch to a
tanking<00:03:06.120> expect<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.629> they<00:03:06.750> reached<00:03:06.989> level

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
tanking expect when they reached level

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.580 
tanking expect when they reached level
90<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.459> they<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:09.239> no<00:03:09.420> idea<00:03:09.690> how<00:03:09.930> their<00:03:10.170> spec

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
90 so they have no idea how their spec

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.410 
90 so they have no idea how their spec
works<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.370> they<00:03:11.489> still<00:03:11.819> know<00:03:12.000> how<00:03:12.209> their

works but they still know how their
class<00:03:12.780> works<00:03:13.340> then<00:03:14.340> there<00:03:14.549> are<00:03:14.579> people<00:03:14.940> that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
class works then there are people that

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.180 
class works then there are people that
leveled<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.599> with<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> tank<00:03:16.379> spec<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:16.920> never

having<00:04:15.959> 10<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.500> those<00:04:16.650> players<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.519> your

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
having 10 of those players on to your

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.360 
having 10 of those players on to your
team<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.449> it's<00:04:19.049> not<00:04:19.289> just<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.829> community

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
team and it's not just the community

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.009 
team and it's not just the community
that<00:04:20.579> will<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.820> affected<00:04:21.209> by<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.419> as<00:04:21.810> I've

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
that will be affected by this as I've

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.959 
that will be affected by this as I've
said<00:04:22.169> before<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.710> leveling<00:04:23.039> process<00:04:23.219> needs

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
said before the leveling process needs

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.060 
said before the leveling process needs
to<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.210> easier<00:04:24.659> because<00:04:24.900> those<00:04:25.229> players<00:04:25.530> need

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
to be easier because those players need

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.510 
to be easier because those players need
to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.360
