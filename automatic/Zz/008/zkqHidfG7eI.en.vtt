all these down so I'm gonna take us shot
it<00:00:23.660> for<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.140> see<00:00:24.290> what<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.440> can<00:00:24.620> come<00:00:24.650> up

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
it for this and see what I can come up

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.960 
it for this and see what I can come up
with<00:00:25.240> there's<00:00:26.240> probably<00:00:26.600> only<00:00:26.720> maybe<00:00:27.020> about

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
with there's probably only maybe about

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.840 
with there's probably only maybe about
10<00:00:28.970> or<00:00:29.090> 15<00:00:29.240> homes<00:00:29.750> here<00:00:30.110> at<00:00:30.380> one<00:00:30.560> time<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:31.160> I

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
10 or 15 homes here at one time and so I

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.209 
10 or 15 homes here at one time and so I
think<00:00:32.629> they<00:00:32.840> called<00:00:33.079> it<00:00:33.170> South<00:00:33.440> Hill<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:33.950> so

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
think they called it South Hill and so

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.190 
think they called it South Hill and so
I'm<00:00:34.340> hopefully<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.329> find<00:00:35.570> something<00:00:35.990> and
