hiatus<00:00:00.359> is<00:00:00.719> just<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.290> quick<00:00:01.500> video<00:00:01.770> on<00:00:02.010> Alec<00:00:02.340> to

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hiatus is just a quick video on Alec to

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.220 
hiatus is just a quick video on Alec to
adjust<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.149> height<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.780> front<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.110> it

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
adjust the height of the front of it

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.289 
adjust the height of the front of it
this<00:00:04.950> bikes<00:00:05.250> good<00:00:05.460> all<00:00:05.549> stripped<00:00:05.850> down<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.180> all

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
this bikes good all stripped down of all

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.700 
this bikes good all stripped down of all
the<00:00:06.390> cables<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.140> can<00:00:07.200> speed<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> video

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
the cables just so I can speed the video

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.560 
the cables just so I can speed the video
up<00:00:07.890> really<00:00:08.250> but<00:00:08.940> as<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.150> can<00:00:09.210> see<00:00:09.300> at<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
up really but as you can see at the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.450 
up really but as you can see at the
moment<00:00:09.960> it's<00:00:10.290> got<00:00:10.440> three<00:00:10.650> spaces<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.280> there

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
moment it's got three spaces in there

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.669 
moment it's got three spaces in there
which<00:00:11.820> obviously<00:00:12.509> centimeter<00:00:13.139> each<00:00:13.290> or<00:00:13.500> three

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
which obviously centimeter each or three

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.770 
which obviously centimeter each or three
centimeters<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> stem<00:00:15.299> has<00:00:15.450> got<00:00:15.630> about

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
centimeters and the stem has got about

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.660 
centimeters and the stem has got about
six<00:00:16.080> degree<00:00:16.379> angle<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.770> him<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.279> moment<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
six degree angle on him so the moment of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.760 
six degree angle on him so the moment of
steps<00:00:17.880> pointing<00:00:18.330> down<00:00:18.510> six<00:00:18.779> degrees<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
steps pointing down six degrees if I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.250 
steps pointing down six degrees if I
were<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> spin<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> stem<00:00:20.730> over<00:00:21.000> 180<00:00:21.359> then<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
were to spin the stem over 180 then the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
were to spin the stem over 180 then the
stem<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.619> pointing<00:00:22.949> up<00:00:23.010> six<00:00:23.279> degrees<00:00:23.609> which

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
stem be pointing up six degrees which

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.700 
stem be pointing up six degrees which
makes<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.510> no<00:00:24.750> three<00:00:25.109> centimeters

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
makes about no three centimeters

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.710 
makes about no three centimeters
difference<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.580> I'll<00:00:26.699> demo<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
difference and I'll demo that in a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.470 
difference and I'll demo that in a
minute<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> I'm<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:29.939> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> talk<00:00:30.300> through

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
minute so I'm just going to talk through

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.900 
minute so I'm just going to talk through
how<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.810> changed<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.439> height<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.520> first<00:00:32.730> way

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
how we changed the height the first way

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020 
how we changed the height the first way
to<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.630> way<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.219> move<00:00:35.399> spaces<00:00:35.940> from

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to do it this way is to move spaces from

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.670 
to do it this way is to move spaces from
the<00:00:36.120> bottom<00:00:36.510> onto<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> top<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
the bottom onto the top to do this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.510 
the bottom onto the top to do this
now<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.860> listen<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> bunk<00:00:43.010> by<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> top<00:00:44.309> cap

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
now we listen the bunk by the top cap

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.920 
now we listen the bunk by the top cap
into<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> bunk<00:00:47.480> there<00:00:48.480> that's<00:00:48.660> somewhere

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
into the bunk there that's somewhere

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.110 
into the bunk there that's somewhere
safe<00:00:49.200> basically<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> pulls<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> falx<00:00:50.969> up

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
safe basically that pulls the falx up

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
safe basically that pulls the falx up
into<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> headset<00:00:52.260> they're<00:00:52.649> all

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
into the into the headset they're all

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
into the into the headset they're all
you<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.860> these<00:00:55.860> were<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you don't need to do these were the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.540 
you don't need to do these were the
right<00:00:56.340> size<00:00:56.370> span<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> listen<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
right size span out is to listen the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
right size span out is to listen the
skimp<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.840> doesn't<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.320> losing<00:01:01.649> too

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
skimp it doesn't need to be losing too

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.100 
skimp it doesn't need to be losing too
much<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:09.210> allows<00:01:09.510> us<00:01:09.540> then

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
much at all this one that allows us then

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.539 
much at all this one that allows us then
to<00:01:10.170> lift<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> stem<00:01:12.290> off<00:01:13.290> away<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> folks

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to lift the stem off away from the folks

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
to lift the stem off away from the folks
itself<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.240> fortune<00:01:15.630> C<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.650> remove

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
itself is a fortune C we don't remove

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
itself is a fortune C we don't remove
the<00:01:17.159> spacer<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.939> two<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.420> three<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.810> generally

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the spacer or two or three but generally

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.830 
the spacer or two or three but generally
is<00:01:19.170> good<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:20.659> replace<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is good to do one at a time replace the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.750 
is good to do one at a time replace the
stem<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.840> leaves<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> proud<00:01:25.320> portion

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.480 

what<00:01:29.760> we<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.180> replace<00:01:31.159> space<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.369> on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
what we do then is replace space it on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.750 
what we do then is replace space it on
top<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:32.940> important<00:01:33.510> there<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.830> then<00:01:35.070> top

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
top is very important there and then top

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.450 
top is very important there and then top
cap

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.530 

back<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:45.010> screw<00:01:45.250> down<00:01:45.430> that's<00:01:46.360> quite

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
back in and screw down that's quite

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.690 
back in and screw down that's quite
important<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.050> this<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:47.350> what<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.490> too

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
important in this one what it is too

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.030 
important in this one what it is too
tight<00:01:48.730> so<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.930> rescrew<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.560> get<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.800> small

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
tight so it is rescrew it to get a small

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.930 
tight so it is rescrew it to get a small
amount<00:01:51.160> of<00:01:51.340> resistance<00:01:53.130> I'm<00:01:54.130> going<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.460> yet<00:01:54.700> to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
amount of resistance I'm going to yet to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.610 
amount of resistance I'm going to yet to
it's<00:01:55.510> one<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.750> our<00:01:55.840> resistance<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.470> from

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
it's one of our resistance and from

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.040 
it's one of our resistance and from
there<00:01:56.830> it's<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.580> little<00:01:57.700> tiny<00:01:58.000> tweak<00:01:58.330> all

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
there it's just a little tiny tweak all

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.870 
there it's just a little tiny tweak all
you<00:01:59.200> want<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.380> check<00:01:59.530> then<00:01:59.800> you've<00:02:00.340> got<00:02:00.700> free

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you want to check then you've got free

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.670 
you want to check then you've got free
movement<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.510> when<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.260> brakes<00:02:02.500> are<00:02:02.619> applied

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
movement and when the brakes are applied

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.500 
movement and when the brakes are applied
you'll<00:02:03.100> go<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.280> apply<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.550> brake<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.119> rock<00:02:04.479> it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
you'll go to apply the brake I rock it

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you'll go to apply the brake I rock it
backwards<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.080> forward<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.380> make<00:02:05.500> sure

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
backwards and forward to make sure

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.130 
backwards and forward to make sure
there's<00:02:05.710> no<00:02:05.830> movement<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.369> head<00:02:06.580> settle

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
there's no movement in the head settle

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.620 
there's no movement in the head settle
we<00:02:08.140> then<00:02:08.320> need<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.500> line<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:10.030> handlebars<00:02:10.479> up

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
we then need to line the handlebars up

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.060 
we then need to line the handlebars up
with<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.810> front<00:02:11.050> wheel<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:14.320> then<00:02:14.470> tighten

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
with the front wheel and then tighten

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:28.720 
with the front wheel and then tighten
stem

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.220 

and<00:02:29.270> what<00:02:29.390> we've<00:02:29.510> done<00:02:29.630> there<00:02:29.810> effectively

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and what we've done there effectively

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.140 
and what we've done there effectively
we've<00:02:30.709> lowered<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> front<00:02:31.400> end<00:02:31.640> by<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we've lowered the front end by a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.390 
we've lowered the front end by a
centimeter<00:02:32.739> right<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> suppose<00:02:34.220> where

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
centimeter right and I suppose where

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.449 
centimeter right and I suppose where
does<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.580> raise<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.000> front<00:02:35.180> end<00:02:36.190> once<00:02:37.190> again

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
does it raise the front end once again

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:51.410 
does it raise the front end once again
loosen<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.090> top<00:02:38.270> cap<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.250> remove

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.660 

and<00:02:51.990> for<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.440> imagine<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.340> undone<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
and for this one imagine have undone the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.520 
and for this one imagine have undone the
four<00:02:53.970> bolts<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.480> front<00:02:54.750> removed<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
four bolts in the front removed the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.840 
four bolts in the front removed the
handlebars<00:02:55.980> okay<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.300> we<00:02:57.390> do<00:02:57.540> is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
handlebars okay then what we do is

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:09.880 
handlebars okay then what we do is
listening<00:02:59.850> off<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.270> stem

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.840 

is<00:03:10.460> then<00:03:11.440> lifts<00:03:12.440> off<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.650> stem<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:16.430> pastry

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
is then lifts off the stem this pastry

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.460 
is then lifts off the stem this pastry
in<00:03:17.450> this<00:03:17.569> case<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:17.870> want<00:03:17.990> to<00:03:18.050> raise<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.290> quite<00:03:18.440> a

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
in this case we want to raise it quite a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.840 
in this case we want to raise it quite a
lot<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:18.830> what<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.010> do<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.400> actually<00:03:19.459> spin

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
lot so what we do is we actually spin

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.340 
lot so what we do is we actually spin
the<00:03:19.970> stem<00:03:20.270> which<00:03:20.900> wouldn't<00:03:21.140> have<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
the stem which wouldn't have the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.720 
the stem which wouldn't have the
handlebars<00:03:21.740> connected<00:03:22.160> by<00:03:22.940> 180<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:25.280> replace

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
handlebars connected by 180 and replace

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.640 
handlebars connected by 180 and replace
then<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.630> see<00:03:26.810> how<00:03:26.990> much<00:03:27.140> that's<00:03:27.410> raised

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
then you can see how much that's raised

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.070 
then you can see how much that's raised
it<00:03:27.890> from<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.530> position<00:03:33.950> here<00:03:34.930> puts<00:03:35.930> me

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
it from so in this position here puts me

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.180 
it from so in this position here puts me
in<00:03:36.170> line<00:03:36.320> with<00:03:36.470> Center<00:03:36.950> at<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.190> top<00:03:37.340> spacer<00:03:39.190> no

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
in line with Center at the top spacer no

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.670 
in line with Center at the top spacer no
spin<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:40.700> you've<00:03:41.420> written<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.930> by

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
spin it you've written it by

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.550 
spin it you've written it by
approximately<00:03:43.070> three<00:03:43.220> centimeters<00:03:44.560> to

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
approximately three centimeters to

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.990 
approximately three centimeters to
finish<00:03:45.800> this<00:03:45.920> one<00:03:46.130> off<00:03:46.190> then<00:03:46.430> we<00:03:46.580> replace<00:03:46.850> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
finish this one off then we replace the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.830 
finish this one off then we replace the
top<00:03:47.209> cap<00:03:49.060> always<00:03:50.060> important<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.630> place<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
top cap always important to a place a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:11.690 
top cap always important to a place a
top<00:03:51.170> cap<00:03:51.380> before<00:03:51.830> tightening<00:03:52.280> up<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.519> stem

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.780 

we<00:04:12.700> dance<00:04:12.910> we<00:04:13.120> feel<00:04:13.330> some<00:04:13.600> resistance<00:04:14.760> quite<00:04:15.760> a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
we dance we feel some resistance quite a

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.160 
we dance we feel some resistance quite a
good<00:04:16.060> bit<00:04:16.210> of<00:04:16.240> resistance<00:04:16.540> everyone's<00:04:16.990> come

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
good bit of resistance everyone's come

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.760 
good bit of resistance everyone's come
to<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.350> stop<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.830> from<00:04:18.610> there<00:04:19.410> they're<00:04:20.410> late<00:04:20.620> to

to a stop and from there they're late to
return<00:04:21.930> check<00:04:22.930> we've<00:04:23.080> got<00:04:23.200> no<00:04:23.290> movement

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
return check we've got no movement

checklist<00:04:24.550> or<00:04:24.700> what<00:04:24.820> free<00:04:25.030> rotation<00:04:25.420> now<00:04:25.750> yeah

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
checklist or what free rotation now yeah

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:38.900 
checklist or what free rotation now yeah
you<00:04:27.970> know<00:04:28.090> we<00:04:28.210> do<00:04:28.330> then<00:04:29.430> tighten<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.490> down

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.600 

what<00:04:39.480> we'd<00:04:39.600> then<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:40.160> put<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.220> handlebars

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
what we'd then do put the handlebars

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.830 
what we'd then do put the handlebars
back<00:04:41.850> into<00:04:42.090> there<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.480> tighten<00:04:42.720> up<00:04:42.780> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
back into there and and tighten up the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.020 
back into there and and tighten up the
front<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.290> stem<00:04:43.470> again<00:04:43.710> obviously<00:04:44.310> you're

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
front of the stem again obviously you're

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.460 
front of the stem again obviously you're
quite<00:04:45.240> right<00:04:45.390> that's<00:04:45.690> how<00:04:45.840> you'd<00:04:45.990> raise<00:04:46.170> it<00:04:46.320> by

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
quite right that's how you'd raise it by

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.900 
quite right that's how you'd raise it by
a<00:04:46.500> lot<00:04:46.710> that's<00:04:47.070> raise<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.400> about<00:04:47.640> six

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
a lot that's raise it about six

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.660 
a lot that's raise it about six
centimeters<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:49.440> that's<00:04:49.800> how<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.130> raise<00:04:50.460> or

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
centimeters and that's how to raise or

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.210 
centimeters and that's how to raise or
notice<00:04:51.000> them
