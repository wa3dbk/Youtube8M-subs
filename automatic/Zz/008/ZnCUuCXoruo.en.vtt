dye testing the purpose of dye testing

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.330 
dye testing the purpose of dye testing
is<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.160> confirm<00:00:14.900> whether<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.109> location<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
is to confirm whether the location of a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.490 
is to confirm whether the location of a
leak<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.580> you've<00:00:17.850> identified<00:00:18.060> visually<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
leak that you've identified visually is

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.279 
leak that you've identified visually is
actually<00:00:20.310> causing<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.510> leak<00:00:21.689> problem<00:00:21.930> if

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
actually causing a leak problem if

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
actually causing a leak problem if
there's<00:00:22.560> actually<00:00:22.980> water<00:00:23.220> escaping<00:00:23.910> from<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
there's actually water escaping from the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.370 
there's actually water escaping from the
pool<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:26.369> order<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.640> dye<00:00:26.910> test<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> process

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
pool so in order to dye test the process
is<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.769> put<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> small<00:00:29.460> amount<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.910> dye<00:00:30.179> close<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
is to put a small amount of dye close to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.040 
is to put a small amount of dye close to
that<00:00:31.619> suspected<00:00:32.369> leak<00:00:32.579> location<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
that suspected leak location and in the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.510 
that suspected leak location and in the
swimming<00:00:34.380> pool<00:00:34.649> there<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> variety<00:00:35.100> of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
swimming pool there are a variety of

swimming pool there are a variety of
suspected<00:00:36.210> leak<00:00:36.390> locations<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
suspected leak locations we're going to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
suspected leak locations we're going to
check<00:00:37.500> around<00:00:37.800> fittings<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.820> check

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
check around fittings when you check

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.090 
check around fittings when you check
around<00:00:39.120> skimmers<00:00:39.719> cracks<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> pool

around skimmers cracks in the pool

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.520 
around skimmers cracks in the pool
anything<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.270> visually<00:00:42.899> identified

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
anything that we visually identified

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
anything that we visually identified
especially<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> seam<00:00:44.610> between<00:00:44.879> several

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
especially a seam between several

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
especially a seam between several
different<00:00:45.840> materials<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.770> could<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
different materials that could be a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
different materials that could be a
source<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.270> leak<00:00:49.280> common<00:00:50.280> misconception

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
source of that leak common misconception

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
source of that leak common misconception
is<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> able<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is that one would be able to just put a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
is that one would be able to just put a
big<00:00:53.309> cloud<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> dye<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> pool<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> watch

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
big cloud of dye into the pool and watch

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
big cloud of dye into the pool and watch
where<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.649> dye<00:00:56.100> moves<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.820> identify<00:00:57.329> where

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
where that dye moves to identify where

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
where that dye moves to identify where
the<00:00:57.629> leaks<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.859> not<00:00:59.100> possible<00:00:59.640> with

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the leaks are that's not possible with

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
the leaks are that's not possible with
dye<00:01:00.329> testing<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:01.320> putting<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> very<00:01:01.949> small

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
dye testing we're putting a very small

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
dye testing we're putting a very small
amount<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.180> dye<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:04.019> close<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.769> someplace<00:01:05.040> we

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
amount of dye very close to someplace we

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.179 
amount of dye very close to someplace we
already<00:01:05.790> suspect<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.600> leaking<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.950> first

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
already suspect is leaking the first

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
already suspect is leaking the first
step<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> assure<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> water<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.780> calm

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
step is to assure that the water is calm

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
step is to assure that the water is calm
and<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.650> any<00:01:10.890> currents<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.490> I've

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and we don't have any currents so I've

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210 
and we don't have any currents so I've
turned<00:01:11.820> off<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> pool<00:01:12.420> equipment<00:01:12.689> now<00:01:13.680> we're

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
turned off the pool equipment now we're

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.910 
turned off the pool equipment now we're
going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> small<00:01:15.270> amount<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> dye<00:01:16.049> right

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
going to put a small amount of dye right

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.270 
going to put a small amount of dye right
close<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> those<00:01:17.790> suspected<00:01:18.240> leak<00:01:18.570> areas<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
close to those suspected leak areas I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
close to those suspected leak areas I
find<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> easiest<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> administer

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
find that the easiest way to administer

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.249 
find that the easiest way to administer
a<00:01:22.080> small<00:01:22.619> amount<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.159> dye<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.570> hold<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a small amount of dye is to hold on to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
a small amount of dye is to hold on to
the<00:01:25.380> dye<00:01:25.530> tester<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the dye tester not like we would a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
the dye tester not like we would a
normal<00:01:27.570> syringe<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.229> our<00:01:28.350> thumb<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.590> top<00:01:29.009> but

normal syringe with our thumb on top but
to<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:29.939> my<00:01:30.329> thumb<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:30.960> first<00:01:31.350> finger<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
to use my thumb and my first finger to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
to use my thumb and my first finger to
hold<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> barrel<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.960> base<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.409> my

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
hold the barrel and then the base of my

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.640 
hold the barrel and then the base of my
palm<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.310> push<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.360> barrel<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.259> gives<00:01:37.470> me

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
palm to push the barrel in that gives me

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.859 
palm to push the barrel in that gives me
the<00:01:37.740> ability<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.430> put<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> fine<00:01:39.180> ribbon

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the ability to really put a fine ribbon

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
the ability to really put a fine ribbon
of<00:01:40.020> dye<00:01:40.229> close<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.009> where<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> suspect<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of dye close to where I suspect that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.330 
of dye close to where I suspect that
leak<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> also<00:01:43.350> find<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.860> helpful<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> have

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
leak is I also find it's helpful to have
