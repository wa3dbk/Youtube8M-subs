some<00:00:35.660> equation<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:37.380> would<00:00:37.680> create<00:00:37.920> a

some equation that would create a

action<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:44.040> would<00:00:44.219> share<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.489> space

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
action and we would share that space

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
action and we would share that space
with<00:00:45.149> kids<00:00:45.420> action<00:00:45.899> which<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.890> something

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
with kids action which now has something

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.330 
with kids action which now has something
like<00:00:47.809> 350<00:00:48.809> kids<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.260> week<00:00:49.559> come<00:00:49.890> through<00:00:50.129> there

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
like 350 kids a week come through there

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
like 350 kids a week come through there
and<00:00:50.629> our<00:00:51.629> rehearsals<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> our<00:00:53.039> shows

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and our rehearsals and some of our shows

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.479 
and our rehearsals and some of our shows
would<00:00:53.760> happen<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:55.559> rental<00:00:56.070> program

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
would happen there and a rental program

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
would happen there and a rental program
I<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.850> very<00:00:57.210> interested<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.989> seeing<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.379> my

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
I was very interested in seeing how my

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.729 
I was very interested in seeing how my
dancers<00:00:59.160> could<00:00:59.879> rehearse<00:01:00.180> while<00:01:01.050> kids<00:01:01.559> were

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

flying around and renters were there

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.760 
flying around and renters were there
with<00:01:04.439> their<00:01:04.619> Lyra<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.250> their<00:01:05.549> hoops<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.770> wanted

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
with their Lyra and their hoops I wanted

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
with their Lyra and their hoops I wanted
to<00:01:07.890> demythologize<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.090> practice<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.750> making

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to demythologize the practice of making

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.770 
to demythologize the practice of making
work<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> bring<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.060> some<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
work and bring back in some of the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
work and bring back in some of the
people<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> young<00:01:14.369> artist<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.509> I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
people that as a young artist you know I
I<00:01:15.900> couldn't<00:01:16.530> keep<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.310> was

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
exchange of information um I think also

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.630 
exchange of information um I think also
the<00:01:38.640> notion<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.390> notion<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.140> i<00:01:41.040> don't<00:01:41.340> know

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the notion the notion that i don't know

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
the notion the notion that i don't know

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
each other and and each other's practice

and<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.079> osmotic<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.799> learn<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
and in this osmotic way learn from it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.389 
and in this osmotic way learn from it
it's<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.810> been<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.409> invigorating<00:01:58.710> idea

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and my question now is the message is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.270 
and my question now is the message is
embedded<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.869> surface<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> outside

the final thing I'd say that I thought
was<00:02:20.970> most<00:02:21.120> critical<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.110> did<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.320> offer<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
was most critical was what did I offer I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.280 
was most critical was what did I offer I
was<00:02:23.430> trying<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.850> take<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> had<00:02:24.660> made<00:02:24.930> and

in<00:03:07.050> class<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.710> i<00:03:07.800> believe<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:09.510> theaters

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
in class and i believe that the theaters

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.160 
in class and i believe that the theaters
it's<00:03:11.610> difficult<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.330> have<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> very<00:03:12.870> very

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
it's difficult to have a very very

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.949 
it's difficult to have a very very
working<00:03:13.560> class<00:03:13.590> person<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.340> not<00:03:14.490> impossible

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
working class person it's not impossible

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.850 
working class person it's not impossible
going<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> theater<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.560> feel<00:03:16.680> comfortable

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
going to a theater and feel comfortable

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.280 
going to a theater and feel comfortable
so<00:03:17.250> i<00:03:17.280> want<00:03:17.580> i<00:03:17.820> want<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:18.750> true<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:19.050> SLAM

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
so i want i want that to be true of SLAM

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.080 
so i want i want that to be true of SLAM
i<00:03:19.320> want<00:03:19.590> them<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.830> walk<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.130> there<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.520> just

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
i want them to walk in there and just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.000 
i want them to walk in there and just
think<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.540> there<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:22.050> there<00:03:22.260> space<00:03:22.740> they

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
think it's there it's there space they

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.790 
think it's there it's there space they
pay<00:03:23.190> taxes<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.030> own<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.590> believe<00:03:25.590> it's

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
pay taxes and they own it I believe it's

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.920 
pay taxes and they own it I believe it's
critical<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.490> keep<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.910> public<00:03:27.270> keep<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.750> open

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
critical to keep it public keep it open

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.980 
critical to keep it public keep it open
to<00:03:28.470> intruders<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:30.000> actually<00:03:30.240> thank<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
to intruders and I actually thank the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.140 
to intruders and I actually thank the
the<00:03:31.410> equation<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.130> strangers<00:03:32.850> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
the equation of strangers and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.320 
the equation of strangers and
interruption<00:03:34.080> create<00:03:34.890> magic<00:03:35.520> because

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
interruption create magic because

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.480 
interruption create magic because
there's<00:03:36.510> not<00:03:36.630> an<00:03:36.810> idea<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.350> exists<00:03:37.890> that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
there's not an idea that exists that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.160 
there's not an idea that exists that
can't<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.090> interrupted<00:03:39.330> if<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.020> good

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
can't be interrupted if it's a good

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.690 
can't be interrupted if it's a good
enough<00:03:40.350> idea<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.920> will<00:03:41.040> come<00:03:41.250> back<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.610> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
enough idea it will come back to you and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.930 
enough idea it will come back to you and
I<00:03:42.630> think<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.080> makes<00:03:43.620> space<00:03:44.280> vibrant<00:03:44.850> I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
I think that that makes space vibrant I

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.430 
I think that that makes space vibrant I
