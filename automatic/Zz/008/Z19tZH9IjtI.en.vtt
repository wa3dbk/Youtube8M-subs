all<00:00:54.840> right<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.469> pulling<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.610> through<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
all right they are pulling it through a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
all right they are pulling it through a
big<00:00:59.520> thing<00:00:59.789> that's<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> front<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> car

big thing that's on the front of the car

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
big thing that's on the front of the car
is<00:01:01.710> basically<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> measurement<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.120> where

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
is basically the measurement of where

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.280 
is basically the measurement of where
your<00:01:03.629> hands<00:01:04.140> could<00:01:04.769> possibly<00:01:05.280> reach<00:01:06.049> well<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
your hands could possibly reach well on

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
your hands could possibly reach well on
the<00:01:07.470> ride<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:08.880> pull<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.119> through<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the ride so they pull that through to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.550 
the ride so they pull that through to
make<00:01:09.750> sure<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.020> you're<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.320> hitting

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
make sure that you're not hitting

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
make sure that you're not hitting
anything<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.310> doing<00:01:11.520> anything<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.090> pull

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
anything or doing anything and pull

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.719 
anything or doing anything and pull
through<00:01:13.020> snore<00:01:13.380> Mele<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:14.010> slow<00:01:14.400> process

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
through snore Mele our very slow process

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
through snore Mele our very slow process
they<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> car<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.350> goes<00:01:16.500> very

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
they take the car and it goes very

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
they take the car and it goes very
slowly<00:01:17.340> through<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> track<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.180> can't<00:01:18.390> just

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
slowly through the track as I can't just

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 
slowly through the track as I can't just
go<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.680> release<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.580> let<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> go

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
go up and release it and let it go

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
go up and release it and let it go
through<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.680> chance<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> something

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
through in the off chance that something

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.280 
through in the off chance that something
wasn't<00:01:23.790> measured<00:01:24.060> correctly<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.869> something

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
wasn't measured correctly or something

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
wasn't measured correctly or something
you<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.560> isn't<00:01:25.920> set<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you know isn't set in the right on the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330 
you know isn't set in the right on the
money<00:01:27.119> train<00:01:27.509> itself<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.130> damage

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
money train itself and that would damage

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
money train itself and that would damage
the<00:01:29.700> ride<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> Train<00:01:30.900> further<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.500> what

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the ride and the Train further so what

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.780 
the ride and the Train further so what
they<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> they<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.520> pull<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
they have to do is they have to pull it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
they have to do is they have to pull it
very<00:01:33.030> slowly<00:01:33.450> through<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:34.020> sure<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
very slowly through to make sure that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.300 
very slowly through to make sure that
all<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> measurements<00:01:35.070> are<00:01:35.159> correct

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
all the measurements are correct

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.870 
all the measurements are correct
actually<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> good<00:01:37.770> example<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.009> this<00:01:39.189> than

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
actually a good example of this than

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.960 
actually a good example of this than
just<00:01:40.090> letting<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.780> go<00:01:40.990> would<00:01:41.229> be<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.970> Hard

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
just letting it go would be the Hard

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.210 
just letting it go would be the Hard
Rock<00:01:43.030> Park<00:01:43.210> slash<00:01:43.869> freestyle<00:01:44.380> music<00:01:44.560> Park<00:01:44.799> the

premiere ride maximum rpms they did that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.850 
premiere ride maximum rpms they did that
on<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.479> one<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.200> break<00:01:50.439> Finn<00:01:50.649> wasn't

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
on that one and a break Finn wasn't

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.950 
on that one and a break Finn wasn't
measured<00:01:51.130> correctly<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.240> ended<00:01:52.869> up

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
measured correctly and it ended up

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.340 
measured correctly and it ended up
making<00:01:53.530> some<00:01:54.310> sparks<00:01:54.729> big<00:01:55.000> bang<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:55.899> they

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
making some sparks big bang and and they

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.080 
making some sparks big bang and and they
had<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.560> go<00:01:56.679> back<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.369> drawing<00:01:57.610> board<00:01:57.970> on

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
had to go back to the drawing board on

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.569 
had to go back to the drawing board on
that<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.570> that's<00:01:59.530> one<00:01:59.799> of<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.039> things<00:02:00.399> that

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
that and that's one of the things that

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.770 
that and that's one of the things that
delayed<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.030> opening<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.600> ride<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:04.270> not

delayed the opening of the ride was not

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.350 
delayed the opening of the ride was not
doing<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.110> proper<00:02:05.350> pull<00:02:05.679> through<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.149> ride

doing a proper pull through but a ride
this<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.780> should<00:02:08.050> definitely<00:02:08.410> want<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.649> make
