00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 hello my name is nickname reality 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.779
 This is a mix of Trishin and today I will tell you how 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.250
 put images and videos 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.400
 photo and text I have to become 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.590
 I understand about this 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.269
 the fact that 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.200
 consider the form or article then two different 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.490
 these are absolutely two different things because 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 what saw the concept 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.550
 the more I asked 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.570
 like this man request for request 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.150
 survive this article so that ears like me 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.280
 already said and people write I will help 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.869
 especially body will try 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.069
 operative 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.980
 here it is on the third with the wagon 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.750
 and start doing this lesson at all 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.980
 very simple 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.250
 so and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.560
 stinks will take eight polina three five 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.160
 minutes 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.230
 sedan shore tracks 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.230
 on the bottom we put our video let's say 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.320
 whatever 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.740
 on some sort of there 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.380
 any kind is also started up 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.410
 either picture 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.410
 I'm here we write some text 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.870
 new shield 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.390
 as usual not in the studio 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 edition 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 here I will write it as 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.260
 that's because they have something cheaper 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.329
 percent 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.100
 Now 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.590
 in settings 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.980
 also click go here but 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.630
 tab 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.930
 as there are parameters 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 and here excavators lower runner what 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.530
 as the conditions of this case 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.780
 that is, I found the nations transparent 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.450
 beat the refinery to the top 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 so our bagram layer will be 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.360
 black father will be transparent 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.780
 and sentences we will see what 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.510
 our sekas on our tv will be seen 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.490
 picture 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 but can also make her 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 text options ie make it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.409
 a little closer to both courses believe that 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.409
 how to see yourself video 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.710
 there closer to the mark like this 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 will see 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 more egorova less 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.159
 here 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.209
 and so tune your 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.699
 parameters and there are two ways we throw what 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.870
 did the archpriest create 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.439
 text 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.679
 also style text 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.249
 anything 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.249
 our to text media 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.869
 go to the un 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.359
 the second way will be based on 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.739
 yourself us after overlaying this video 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.180
 so the composer mod 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 we change the way we lay on us 4 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.159
 and so our mask 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.749
 superimposed 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.749
 and we see that the layer is simply replaced 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.930
 You can also multiplex m dak 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.639
 min 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.479
 can also be customized 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.479
 frames here and 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.439
 and so on 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.699
 Basically this way 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.749
 can be used not only installation 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.989
 Vegas is there and we can get it from 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.119
 all these three just throw 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.070
 and put 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.089
 overlay 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.929
 that's of course a plus 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:13.829
 trying to ensure that is just as easy 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.249
 better already here in the parameters of it just 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.769
 remove 5 cliffs beat lift 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.879
 and all overlay stanislav 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.959
 was 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.209
 i.e. us pies 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.559
 so you can calmly 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:26.859
 to make 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.939
 percent beautiful such captions 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.579
 Okay, that's all I wanted to say 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.449
 stay on for the whole term 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.989
 I myself was the admin of the color of them among the tires stopping 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.879
 on the website we ask what is not clear 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.789
 I'll tell you questions 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.879
 I will show 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.939
 good luck everyone all bye
