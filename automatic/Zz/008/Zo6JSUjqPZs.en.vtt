00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.800
 sometimes yes 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.320
 when it rubs as they are, it is his cousin 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.639
 but be well on this occasion 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.740
 I come to bring a tutorial of jetas 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.450
 uncomfortable online how to clone your 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.950
 vehicles and can sell them from a 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.419
 very very simple way 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.009
 so put a lot of tension what 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.820
 first thing that we go is to have a vehicle 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.289
 that we bought and arranged not blue 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.119
 preferably for you to des 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.160
 very much money the second thing we have 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.440
 what to do is to go to what is the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.390
 cellular to the internet after travel and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.309
 transportation later we'll go to the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.930
 bicycle section and we will buy 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.489
 anyone who is here the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.200
 preference buy this is worth two 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.210
 a thousand dollars is much better so that 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.820
 spend as much and good as they have it 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.039
 well now what follows is to go 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.140
 choose the vehicle we want to clone 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.570
 or that in this case I want to thunder what 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.280
 is the father who is here in this 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.870
 place not and good what we have to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.000
 to do is get on this vehicle and 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.100
 get it out of what our fat and good 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.320
 outside we will be waiting for a friend 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 to help us make this tutorial 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 and good season we will do 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.930
 here aside from what is the output 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 to put exactly here in this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.340
 place and good as we see we are going to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.790
 tell our friend to put a c4 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 here between in between what they are 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.300
 these stripes in the part where it goes 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.430
 starting what are these heels that 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.860
 put the c4 there not and good as you put 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.560
 what is the c4 we will get to what 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.240
 It's our garage again and we'll tell you 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.549
 to our friend to get on the vehicle 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.040
 that we just pulled out not then now 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.080
 since we are inside what is ours 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.840
 channel we will wait for what appears 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.450
 the bicycle and well we approach 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.070
 she and we got on the bike and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.619
 When we go up, a message will appear 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 we are going to confirm it and good we will begin 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.190
 to leave what is the garage and good 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 when we look out we will tell 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.950
 our friend that we are stepping on the c4 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 of the toni and obviously we will die 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.819
 then we will appear somewhere 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 random close in what is the garage and 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.720
 well we will run very quickly to what 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.020
 which is the vehicle and well we will tell 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.690
 our friend to get off what is 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.120
 not good vehicle and we got on and we 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.760
 we go directly to the destroyer saints 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.960
 since we find ourselves the just saints 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.210
 well, let's hope that we 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.090
 attend and we will repair what is the 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.970
 vehicle ok and good when we repair it 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.130
 Well, this will give us all the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.890
 money possible not then the promoter 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.930
 how can you see what else 720 thousand 650 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.960
 dollars and well this helps a lot 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.150
 obviously to have more money not 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.730
 then now obviously appear in what 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.650
 which is the courtyard of the cult in saints and 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 open the cell phone we will go to contact 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.580
 then the mechanic and we will tell him that we 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.580
 bring the same vehicle 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.930
 was cloning ok to pass is that the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.780
 vehicle will bring it to me without any 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.290
 problem then I can go back to repeat 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.180
 what is this same process to follow 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.500
 getting but in this way is 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.200
 very cured because the truth only 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.970
 you spend two thousand dollars of what is the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.590
 bicycle and good can be 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.650
 repeating and repeating without having to 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.209
 wait for 45 minutes or 30 minutes 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 they give you waiting to sell each 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.860
 vehicle not then they will be able to taxi 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.510
 ninth in a very simple way what 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.070
 can you do not do everything I have been 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.410
 been for repeating so that 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.390
 obviously they are knowing and not of a 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.620
 very easy and good way I do not know but they 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.850
 have liked the video remember to give it 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.130

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.480
 we arrived at the 250 likes and good 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.650
 remember your who wear social networks 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.730

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.830

 as strangers or the blue cousin and good 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.540
 but be well this time I come 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.549

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.890

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.360
 if it's a coupe you can not get it 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.890
 more than in this way and good
