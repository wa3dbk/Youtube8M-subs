 show players the consequences of large-scale 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.620
 environmental disaster on earth about 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.980
 the reasons for which it is not known 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.120

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.810
 last week 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.139
 testers participated in two hundred 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.569
 twenty six matches that died 

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:15.399
 9011 characters now the team has 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.590
 desire to achieve that with us 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.079
 servers were at least 200 people 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.999
 not only during the day but also at night based on 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.279
 the above it can be assumed that 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.469
 vostok games will continue to send 

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:30.159
 invitations until it is 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:32.349
 this limit was reached the players fought 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 so far only in one mode namely in 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.880
 command pvp 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.369
 developers are listening carefully 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.259
 to the tester since at the moment in 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.959
 the game still needs a lot to dock 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.119
 finish sound problems 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.840
 player sync release new game 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.420
 planned for now until the end of this year 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.539
 this week news journalist 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 Site 13 vs made a report in which 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.950
 told me that in the city of Mike State 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.170
 georgia began filming film adaptation 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.649
 popular racing franchise need for 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.469
 speed 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.819
 this city was chosen as 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.250
 natural background for the upcoming 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.539
 film adaptation film is engaged studio 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.209
 dreamworks studios 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.970
 and in the director's chair nobody else is sitting 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.560
 like cattle you don't know that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.440
 director but already removed here is the law of valor 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.079
 but not important as for the plot 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.420
 here everything is pretty simple the main character 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.060
 Naturally well, really 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.489
 how else would a prisoner be sentenced 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 imprisoned as soon as our sufferer 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.110
 out of prison his former ally 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.239
 who is also that guy 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.950
 who substituted the protagonist but 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.079
 mean for his head solid 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.450
 reward and then it starts 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.790
 racing pursuit from new york to 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.180
 los angeles release a movie on big 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.180
 screens planned February 7, 2014 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.010
 publisher 505 games and developer tutorials 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 CELT you decide to release the sequel to its 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.420
 undeniably excellent cooperative play 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.090
 sda heist in August of this year 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.130
 payday 2 was supposed to 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.829
 extend exclusively through 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.180
 network services steam x-box live and 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.519
 playstation network 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.950
 but at the moment the publisher decided 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.700
 release the game and on physical media 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.639
 but only for x-box 360 and playstation 3 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.919
 as far as gamers are concerned, they 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.239
 will cost only the digital version yes and 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.849
 small loss 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.430
 game director david gale force said 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.470
 that the game just got too big 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.609
 to stay only on xbox live and 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.799
 playstation network 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:43.109
 therefore the only way out 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.109
 is the release of the game on the disks 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.790
 The development of the game watch dogs is underway 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.760
 full swing 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.920
 at the same time ubisoft montreal to 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.230
 achieve maximum realism not 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.480
 shy to consult with kaspersky lab 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.390
 on all sorts of hacking and 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.430
 its correct display in the game so 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.710
 As in the laboratory, Kaspersky is no longer 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.750
 first year doing all sorts of 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.000
 problems of this kind then im not 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.700
 it is hard to help developers 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.980
 sometimes they say yes it is possible but 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.710
 sorry this word or 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.290
 it doesn't work that way explained 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.120
 the producer of the game before the mini guide is possible 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.310
 watch dogs we get not only 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.550
 interesting but also the most realistic 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.990
 model hacking wait and see good to 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.170
 release is not too much time 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.970
 Relatively little left 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.520
 steam likes to surprise and delight 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.950
 updates guys from valv decided 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.930
 to please the players and that they were not 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.270
 bored to play you might think such 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.000
 it may be decided for what you play 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.700
 give not only all kinds of achievements 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.770
 but also the cards yes they decided to turn 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.790
 use of steam in the collection 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.610
 card game 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.900
 nothing but raising your chsv from 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.420
 the fact that you have collected a huge collection 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.580
 cards will certainly not happen 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.580
 there are competitions on this topic 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.490
 but steam trading cards havenâ€™t yet 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.670
 henceforth every one playing games 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.140
 steam can join the community 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.690
 gamblers and start to do it 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.290
 strange thing decks is not very much 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.390
 but more will be dedicated to each of them 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.650
 a particular game and spending time 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.230
 for example in dota 2 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.300
 and there are cards for her user 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.550
 able to get one more card 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.340
 update will bring in steam such a thing 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.200
 how will each user level 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.630
 personal level which depends on 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.360
 achievement of and possibly on quantity 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.000
 cards you collected about cards this 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.860
 just my guess but i'm nothing 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.530
 wonder about it this will be 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.630
 look update has not yet touched 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.320
 all users so don't 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.420
 to panic 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.960
 if nothing is in your profile 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.960
 has changed 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.440
