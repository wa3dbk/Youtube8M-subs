00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 Dear friends, I am 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.009
 receive a message from a friend who 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 does not exactly remember her name now 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:22.380
 and she asked me to show how 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.539
 working with 88 dalton spout per 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.289
 while she has but she does not know 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.040
 working with this alley then the beak is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.700
 this here 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 he does two jobs in one piece 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.680
 from above is the shape of a cherry 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 bottom 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.899
 It's like a petal I 'm going to be. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.680
 fitting in there to my mother of confectionery 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 I'll do the little jobs here. 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 so here I put a shape and I go 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 Try to do it with a hand, it's just you. 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.310
 have so many options to work with 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.409
 it both up and down 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.729
 So I'm going to make it like this. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.729
 right up the top to turn stone 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.800
 the leaf will be kind of difficult because 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.600
 When is she going to slip a little? 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:40.320
 can do this drape or 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:41.670
 this format here entangled him as 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 I told you it's going to be a little bit 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.680
 Difficult for now, I'm holding my hand. 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.910
 but I think it will give to you 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:04.020
 understand a little bit now I 'm going to turn 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.390
 this bottom part that I'm now going to turn 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:17.540
 She's so down, you can both. 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:17.540
 work drap walking as you wanted here 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.570
 you should also on the edge of the cake stands 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.570
 very beautiful 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.480
 the frill 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:57.650
 So 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:03:02.910
 zig zag is not very cool here 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:09.500
 I'll just drape it for us. 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:12.300
 so that's how it goes with us 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.400
 have to get him to put it on the sleeve there 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:24.750
 who work with him to see what he 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:27.840
 will it come out that if you want 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.320
 work with him on the side 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.530
 You can work it on the side. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:44.340
 the ball in that direction to turn off 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:46.880
 zague and here comes with the other by 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.880
 top 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.490
 so it gets very interesting 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.299
 for you to see 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.320
 So I hope you have 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.110
 liked 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.720
 As the beak said, it is for him in the hand of 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.820
 confetti and work there to see what 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 will leave there 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.300
 I hope you have enjoyed it and even 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.300
