00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 How do crocodiles mate 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.319
 mating the crocodiles have a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.120
 mating process that is similar 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.240
 to the other types of reptiles 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.280
 big labial lizards the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 fact mating between a male and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.020
 an adult female always happens in the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.000
 water and requires internal fertilization 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.029
 of female eggs with sperm 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.039
 male crocodiles mate by 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.560
 season at the beginning of winter 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.410
 because that allows them to lay eggs 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.719
 in early spring put the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.719
 eggs the female crocodile will put 20 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.820
 to 70 eggs she puts them in a nest that 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.340
 build in the sand after building 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.129
 several test nests to be able 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.829
 find the ideal location after 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 put them and get back very defensive of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.140
 his nest hissing growling and inflating his 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.539
 body to show a warning to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.579
 anyone who approaches his father 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.079
 You can also stop to help and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 defend the nest 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.329
 curiously the sex of the crocodiles 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.189
 they are determined not by genetics but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.510
 by the air temperature during the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.720
 second and third period 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.750
 incubation for it all the offspring of 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 a posture will be of the same sex the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.120
 Temperature range for males is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.910
 narrow so many more females are born 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.730
 the young and the first months when 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.250
 the offspring are about to be born they will 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.470
 singing noises this is an indication 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.380
 for the mother that is the time that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.420
 she take out the coverage of the mother nest and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.730
 father also help the eggs get 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.310
 open by breaking the shells with their 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.440
 mouths once the babies are born 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.410
 the mother will lead to water or 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.080
 will load in your mouth mothers will protect 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.030
 to the offspring for two years the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.580
 reproduction of the crocodiles is a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.950
 through eggs since they are reptiles and 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.410
 therefore oviparous reach the age 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.170
 reproductive after 10 years of 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.010
 life the mating is done in the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.320
 shore 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.479
 the male courts the female by hitting her 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.729
 strongly with the snout at the same time 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.250
 it splashes the water with its tail 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.770
 start swimming in a circle until you 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.440
 approximate enough to perform the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.720
 copulation the females elaborate their 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 not far from the shore in the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.580
 earth or in mounds of vegetation 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.400
 they cover their eggs and depending on the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.200
 species are left to take care of the nest 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.420
 some females take care of it with so much 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.640
 devotion that they prefer to die before 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.820
 allow some predator to approach 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.400
 to the nest the posture can be from 20 to 90 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.310
 eggs and the hatching time is 4 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.110
 months when the offspring are born the female 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.610
 he transports them in his snout to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.130
 keep them grouped 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.140
 the rains mark the beginning of the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.260
 reproductive season of crocodiles 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.080
 in the country for this reason is more 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.540
 likely to observe them on estuarine beaches and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.030
 mouths of rivers is a behavior 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 normal because it is the beginning of the time 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.800
 reproductive and dominant males 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.710
 they take the crocodiles of smaller sizes 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.960
 of their territory these small animals 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.780
 they go to other areas where they are little 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.620
 frequent for then in three or five 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.230
 months to return to their usual habitat 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.270
 explained the biologist Juan Bolaños in May 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.800
 the national system of areas of 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.380
 sinac conservation 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.830
 and received reports of sightings in 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.110
 jacob tárcoles guacalillo bajamar kills 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.560
 lemon kettle and the narrowness in 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.750
 puntarenas in this era the males 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.940
 they get more aggressive because they start to 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.370
 mark your territory and compete between 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.770
 they the youngest are going to be 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.900
 expelled some stay in the 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.690
 periphery of the habitat and others seek 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.480
 other territories we could say that 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.570
 Almost all rivers have crocodiles and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.630
 They even go to sea because they use it to 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.820
 move from one river to another commented jose 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.510
 joaquin bald wildlife manager 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.060
 of the sinac according to bald the crocodiles do not 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.610
 they necessarily attack people by 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.520
 hungry but because they feel threatened 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.500
 and they are going to defend their territory this is 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.900
 the case of the females that put the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.210
 eggs on the banks of rivers where 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.000
 vegetation abounds as they will tend 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.340
 to defend the nest the vegetation of 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.350
 amazes the nest of about 40 eggs that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.380
 find inside a middle hole 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.639
 meter deep in the earth 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.360
 hidden inaccessible 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.999
 like feline birds and reptiles caution 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.849
 to people who live near the 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:38.430
 margins of the rivers are recommended 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.889
 keep the cattle chickens and horses 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.860
 in the pen or place a fence for 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.529
 keep pets away you have to 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.900
 pay attention to children not lose them 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:51.180
 of sight and ensure that they do not feed and 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.330
 bother reptiles not to provoke 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.460
 the experts advise not to swim or 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.039
 fish in rivers where there is usually 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.639
 presence of crocodiles as drinking trough and 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:06.740
 tempisque guanacaste the latter has 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.740
 the most abundant population in the country
