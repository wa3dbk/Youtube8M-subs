00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.580
 ladies and gentlemen, I would know tonight 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.560
 we will make a raviolo we did 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 we have homemade pasta 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.349
 cut has known as enough 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 we did go with some 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.480
 water and we took it off had put it up 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 a sheet of baking paper with a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.920
 little bit of oil on now we will go to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.580
 put an asparagus cream on the base 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.609
 in this way have been cooked 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.920
 asparagus are desalted and have been 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.230
 passed to the mixer with a little oil the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.520
 let's put this in a mirror on 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.649
 base of our raviolone we took 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 a private egg yolk of his album e 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:58.170
 we're going to position it above in this 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:02.489
 way without trying to break it 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.949
 we will go to salt and then we will go to give 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:12.030
 a sour note with a bit of zest of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.950
 lime in this world only the green part 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.430
 to give him some acidity 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.430
 in this way 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.409
 now we're going to cover ours 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.009
 raviolone in this way with much 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 delicacy you see it also shows 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:38.659
 through the pasta this way 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.659
 now as you can see 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.060
 we will cook steam again for about 5 minutes 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.850
 and no more our raviolone without 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.610
 obviously cook the egg yolk 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.310
 that when you go to eat then you will have to 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.740
 still remain liquid 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.479
 let's go and cover for five 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.479
 minutes for the end of crying
