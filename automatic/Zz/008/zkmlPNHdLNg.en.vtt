00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
and not too good things all around but

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.570 
and not too good things all around but
something<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:39.990> just<00:05:40.260> blows<00:05:40.590> my<00:05:40.890> mind<00:05:41.190> is<00:05:41.400> the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
something that just blows my mind is the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.450 
something that just blows my mind is the
law<00:05:41.760> system<00:05:42.270> how<00:05:42.420> complicated<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.500> is<00:05:43.680> with

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
law system how complicated it is with

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.700 
law system how complicated it is with
its<00:05:44.640> day<00:05:44.910> laws<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.660> other<00:05:45.780> stuff<00:05:46.200> which<00:05:46.500> is

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
its day laws and other stuff which is

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.470 
its day laws and other stuff which is
much<00:05:46.980> deeper<00:05:47.220> compared<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.940> finish<00:05:48.270> law

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
much deeper compared to finish law

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.050 
much deeper compared to finish law
system<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.080> rules<00:05:49.320> but<00:05:50.160> whether<00:05:50.580> it's<00:05:50.850> good

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
system and rules but whether it's good

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.660 
system and rules but whether it's good
or<00:05:51.090> bad<00:05:51.210> I<00:05:51.630> still<00:05:51.930> think<00:05:51.960> us<00:05:52.740> is<00:05:52.920> not<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.430> bad

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
or bad I still think us is not a bad

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.670 
or bad I still think us is not a bad
country<00:05:53.970> and<00:05:54.390> I<00:05:54.600> would<00:05:54.840> love<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.290> visit<00:05:55.320> it
