00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.970
 Hey guys 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.460
 plus a low cost channel video 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:32.489
 Today I'm going to talk about kansas 250 and a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 little 9 Aug the bike is for sisters and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.320
 galley that is dawn must have 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 perceived and video kansas video 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 from the beginning of the channel here 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.920
 On the same trip, I do not know if anyone 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.260
 realized I was going to be quiet but like in a 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 my city ​​is small, just try to record 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.500
 the video when you have any 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 group hits and returns to the meeting and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.600
 take advantage of this trip to 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 videos and today we went to the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.760
 meeting and on the way back now I'm recording 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:22.260
 this video does not go there a task 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.600
 is kansas 250 worth buying 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.980
 she notices that there are few units going 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 make less than a thousand units but 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.390
 advantage of that same mechanics of 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 250 yamaha face 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 so many people are unsure why the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 dafra does not want to buy gets in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:55.040
 doubt it's worth taking this bike 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.040
 suck the fuck who gave birth to take 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:05.140
 has a level of fucking direction and I 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.830
 I had one and I liked the brand when you 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.300
 out of grace 150 cubic centigrade goes to 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.360
 250 is another thing when you get a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.500
 bike that is the group you remember was from 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.000
 kansas and you already have that motorcycle label 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.540
 It 's really nice to hear that, too. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 noises and enjoys sports exhaust the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.850
 advantage that her mechanics is the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 same thing then I believe that 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.799
 90% of the parts you use the turn it is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.120
 that thing you also find 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:53.650
 some pieces of other deaths in my 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.310
 honor and bike is the same party party 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.490
 that used in them the party of bikes of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.020
 50 cylinder motorcycle parts 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.410
 this defeat and tie the steering box 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.570
 of the yamaha factory rolling a second 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:15.470
 what he farc wave you use shineray 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.470
 50 cc 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:26.310
 then you find alternatives to 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:29.400
 parts for ii is a very hot bike of 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.940
 walk very comfortable 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.020
 Do you have any idea what my original band is? 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.560
 more comfortable as cattle than this 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.870
 tragic story is not is the bike a lot 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.060
 good or I do not regret 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.600
 I did not spend much time with her because 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.990
 I went crazy on the bigger bike and the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.640
 opportunity and it was this fashion here but 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.460
 When I bought it, I imagined it would not 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.520
 I would like another bike 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.470
 She has a legal strength and it's good to 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.590
 traveling is light from the goal to andré sá a 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.370
 compared to six-season motorcycle 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.370
 How are you? 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.830
 It's worth it with a song there she went 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.040
 manufactured in 2009 then you will find 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.170
 some well preserved specimens 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.810
 augusto radio also a much better price 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.090
 account of what would be an upset 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.580
 so if you got the turn of 2001 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.570
 much preserved as a song like me 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.890
 I bought it but it's much more expensive, you go. 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.890
 to pay the base value on 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:51.160
 so we'll make you pay only 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.160
 in relation to the upset but is a death that 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.040
 is in doubt if it is going or at the turn 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.270
 it's very worth they have trouble 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.480
 chronicle the turn in and who has fans like 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.240
 careful also that you are afraid of happening 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.340
 with them that the oil pump 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.180
 Gear Oil rock band 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.880
 a problem and 40 out of 40 50 thousand 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:22.790
 kilometers you that you trade him 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.290
 proposing precautions are turning this into 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.130
 very good bike 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.640
 you find pieces for her in the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.640
 Internet 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:42.270
 sj in the fibers and lenine and it's worth it if 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:45.210
 you have a 150 will also start at 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:53.520
 bush world can break for 250 goes 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:57.260
 calm and is a recent speech will 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.970
 have a bunch of a twin engine in 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.340
 vba 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.900
 The exception is that I like motorcycles. 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.700
 ran away 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.870
 so if you will water it is cancer 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.250
 feather 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:17.250
 Drilling the well-preserved motorcycle proctor 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.550
 de taison will be her mother has another 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.120
 ask that it will be very expensive for those who do not 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.419
 has both our activity 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.810
 you may be allowed to Yamaha and is 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.870
 complicated but I bought a good one 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.370
 time I did not regret a better pain of 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:43.500
 Just gave me joy and I just left. 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:45.419
 From her to get this 650 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.030
 I will tell in the next video and also 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.180
 about tragedy is about research 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.870
 What I did to get to a certainty 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.870
 thanks slave
