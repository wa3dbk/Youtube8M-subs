bears are strong agile animals that will
defend<00:01:55.370> themselves<00:01:55.790> they're<00:01:56.360> young<00:01:56.690> and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
defend themselves they're young and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.260 
defend themselves they're young and
they're<00:01:57.590> territory<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:58.550> they<00:01:59.030> feel
