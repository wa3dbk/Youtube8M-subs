00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.450
 p 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.899
 any team but we declare it castro caldelas 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.229
 and we start by starting with a little butter 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.289
 the mold where we are going to win 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.289
 we started the base well 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.150
 and the walls of the mold 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.400
 as already commented on the blog 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.100
 this scholarship is very easy very easy to do and really the recipe I have taken 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.259
 of two others 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.379
 since the day I did it and my son asks me for it when 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.900
 and I thought about this occasion publicly record the blog and enjoy it 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.620
 everyone 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.520
 the function of butter 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.240
 is that the oven paper sits well in the mold 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.560
 and then it is not much easier to unmold what you do not on paper what 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.900
 we remember and ready 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900
 when we add 200 grams of butter 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.790
 and we are going to mix them well 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 with 400 grams of seals 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.970
 we will incorporate now 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 4 eggs 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 and everything must be mixed well 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.840
 we now add 200 grams of liquid cream 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 or milk cream 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.920
 when they are integrated into the mixture 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 it's time to incorporate 400 grams of sand 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.660
 and a packet of chemical yeast 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.660
 what we mix 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 little by little the fanaticisms to the mix 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.349
 with some rods we will get that there is not a single group 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.689
 although you already know if you have a robot 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.069
 a mixer a blender for it will be easier 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.449
 when we have the mixture already ready 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.029
 we do not put in the mold 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.789
 and now we are going to incorporate sugar 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.719
 and we will not be rascals 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.759
 we have 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.759
 enormously generous 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.870
 We do not put 60-degree seats into the oven for 50 minutes 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.439
 and we already have the vitalist 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.399
 really delicious very simple 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:30.969
 and I hope you like it 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.829
 I have a hug until then
