00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 one day good evening good night Children 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.910
 maybe 16 son big players are 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.719
 welcome to the new touch video 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 it's soft 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.059
 today I will bring something different something that 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.880
 I already created 13 for my channel already enough 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.680
 time for those writing on the channel already 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 Some time already knows that I already spoke 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 about it more often is that it creates bring 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.599
 but I never had the possibility or the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.369
 time to research this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 but what I'm talking about is theories 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.130
 facts and secrets pokémon I do not 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.579
 I managed to make some today. I'll bring it. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.520
 that five facts about the pokémon 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 in this case is facts about young people in the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 general nothing about the animated series nor 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.730
 the movies so let's here started with 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.730
 mine without facts because I live 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.450
 let's start by singing in area 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.340
 the first generation nor to wash and 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.440
 there is a man in the laboratory because 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.899
 monique of the stone 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.330
 a lightning strike struck in exchange for the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.430
 When you complete this exchange and return 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.759
 talking to her and I said angrily 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.700
 I think the 1,000 evolved this gave a lot 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.039
 speculation that everyone thought the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.679
 rancho it to have another evolution picasso 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.659
 and have another emotional way beyond the 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.929
 right to the second generation was 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.450
 omério present a height in Picabu 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.179
 called picabu a lot of people thought that 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 It is to be the evolution of the right to such 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.590
 But what happens is that this is a 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.409
 transition error in blue version 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.899
 Japanese and this is really absurd. 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.030
 Lab I get a shock instead 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.640
 right to fifth when the brain 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.440
 because a shock normally dies if it does not 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.569
 you have to ensure once we take the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.950
 first generation the pokémons do not 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.950
 they held items 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.739
 I evolved the fame of Xandão and ilsinho that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.569
 corrected this transmission 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.390
 simply change any one dies 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.700
 we will then peace afterwards with the fact that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.340
 we go to the homonymous area instead 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 spoken a Pokemon that my one 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.010
 evolution of the mega pokémon 1 million you 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.500
 does everything because monicelli there and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.800
 Have you noticed that the brain haithem? 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.129
 ruby a daughter in her body and in her 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.950
 Shine shape has a brown squid is one 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.349
 against the three games ruby ​​sapphire and 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.400
 remembered is where I was introduced by 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.620
 first time 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.410
 Now let's go through this area 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.140
 new but specifically the black pokémon 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.239
 and even if you have seen the artwork lucas 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.300
 and the oil will not notice that I am 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.569
 hold a ball because 1 falls only 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.849
 it is not because the ball is normal if 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.200
 Do you remember well, euston? 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.020
 war a team 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.810
 good because the mazembe ball and not another 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.330
 Why ball any risk one set on fire? 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.110
 a joke nobody's to say 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.879
 complete is a repeat of dae nam hall 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.239
 continuing here in the education zone with 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.090
 One more fact, I knew how to take care of me. 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.300
 single game that captures all students 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.030
 give them something in this case open the seas 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.880
 where you can capture two more 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.580
 types of non a point of information and 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.830
 point in progression and outside this area 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.190
 can find a market in my 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.440
 opinion any building is worth 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.450
 prove he does not even want to win nearly 30 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.130
 Only one woman has a woman who is normal 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.690
 always worth 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.329
 We will then move on to the region 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.090
 of the new that of generation pokémon black 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.010
 you started in the middle of any 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.950
 have between two and three armored 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.390
 being one of it's ability dribbled O 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.430
 hidden care 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.860
 there is a pokémon that has four 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.720
 units or talk about besc 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.389
 but is not a tenth in any is the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.120
 Basque in the south is that I think twice 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.870
 justice can not have four years of 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.880
 age 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.220
 You can capture me with two 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.100
 skills in the wild mode that is the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.050
 hekla himself and adapt me to Latin and this is the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.229
 chosen unit or its ability to 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.960
 mou is new to here but in which we live 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.110

 man lying more exchange and that the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.930
 besc world 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.639
 when you play in a daring team 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.270
 I knew that they were going to see 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.220
 this pokémon and I have rock what to do 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.220
 or a single pokémon with four 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.650
 units is legally the only one that dies 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.840

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.080
 series and gave them mentality what they think
