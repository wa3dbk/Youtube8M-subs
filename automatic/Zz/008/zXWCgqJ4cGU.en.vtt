00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
because as you know when a hard drive

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.360 
because as you know when a hard drive
runs<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.390> spins<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> don't<00:02:19.800> want<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.190> be

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
runs it spins so you don't want it to be

runs it spins so you don't want it to be
too<00:02:20.640> much<00:02:20.850> vibration<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.810> want<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.170> fasten

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
too much vibration so you want to fasten

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.300 
too much vibration so you want to fasten
it<00:02:22.769> what<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:23.519> include<00:02:23.880> schools<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:26.130> plug
