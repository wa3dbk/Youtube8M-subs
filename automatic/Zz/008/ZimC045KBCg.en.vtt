well<00:00:22.980> let's<00:00:23.189> move<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> camera<00:00:23.640> around

CACO eliademy arunoda a couple it sure

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.349 
CACO eliademy arunoda a couple it sure
does<00:00:38.820> look<00:00:38.850> real<00:00:39.949> Ida<00:00:40.949> program<00:00:41.219> okay<00:00:42.030> listen

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
does look real Ida program okay listen

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.119 
does look real Ida program okay listen
while<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.199> playing<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> simulation

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
while I was playing with the simulation

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.200 
while I was playing with the simulation
in<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:44.339> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.519> office<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.089> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
in back to the office when the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.639 
in back to the office when the
programmers<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.839> looking<00:00:46.079> over<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.350> shoulder

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
programmers was looking over my shoulder

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.110 
programmers was looking over my shoulder
watching<00:00:46.769> me<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.159> this<00:00:47.339> and<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:47.850> thought<00:00:48.000> we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
watching me do this and he thought we

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.340 
watching me do this and he thought we
had<00:00:48.239> security<00:00:48.629> cameras<00:00:48.989> set<00:00:49.109> up<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
had security cameras set up in the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.039 
had security cameras set up in the
conference<00:00:49.500> room<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.780> guess<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
conference room I guess that the

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.450 
conference room I guess that the
testament<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.589> how<00:00:52.680> real<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.309> does

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
testament is how real this really does

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.689 
testament is how real this really does
look<00:00:56.719> at<00:00:57.719> home<00:00:58.530> okay<00:00:58.829> yesterday
