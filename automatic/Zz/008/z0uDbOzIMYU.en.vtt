I<00:00:00.030> mean<00:00:00.210> on<00:00:00.390> that<00:00:00.420> choke<00:00:00.780> it's<00:00:00.960> not<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> complete

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
I mean on that choke it's not a complete

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.500 
I mean on that choke it's not a complete
wall<00:00:01.709> off<00:00:01.890> obviously<00:00:02.100> but<00:00:03.060> they<00:00:03.330> were<00:00:03.389> going

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
wall off obviously but they were going

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.940 
wall off obviously but they were going
to<00:00:03.750> have<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.080> go<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.290> long<00:00:04.319> way<00:00:04.500> around<00:00:04.740> to

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950

this ramp at least not right now it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.700 
this ramp at least not right now it
looks<00:00:15.210> like<00:00:15.330> there<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.660> another<00:00:16.170> void<00:00:16.440> ray<00:00:16.650> in

looks like there is another void ray in
place<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.430> white<00:00:17.789> rock<00:00:18.029> trying<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> put

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
to have to back off because there are

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.849 
to have to back off because there are
just<00:00:21.420> too<00:00:21.689> many<00:00:21.720> marines<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.680> entrance

just too many marines at that entrance

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.040 
just too many marines at that entrance
right<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.150> back<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> base<00:00:24.900> of

right now but going back to the base of
white<00:00:25.230> rock<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.830> looks<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.160> he<00:00:26.279> does<00:00:26.490> have

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
white rock it looks like he does have

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
white rock it looks like he does have
two<00:00:26.910> more<00:00:27.090> gateways<00:00:27.330> coming<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.230> he

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
two more gateways coming in and he

the energy being depleted he has been

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.650 
the energy being depleted he has been

can see does have one mule on his
mineral<00:01:02.340> line<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> couple

mineral line right now but a couple

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.759 
mineral line right now but a couple
times<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.840> noticed<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.350> peoples<00:01:04.650> on

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
times I have noticed two peoples on

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
times I have noticed two peoples on
there<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.489> he<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:05.820> possibly<00:01:06.150> even<00:01:06.299> been<00:01:06.479> using

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
there so he has possibly even been using

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
there so he has possibly even been using
those<00:01:07.130> using<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.220> orbital<00:01:08.580> command<00:01:08.790> energy

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

it<00:01:50.490> looks<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.600> take<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> look<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it looks like if we take a look at the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
it looks like if we take a look at the
production<00:01:52.320> overlay<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.040> stimpack

is researching and if you already have
the<00:01:55.530> shields<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.310> their<00:01:56.520> arms<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.240> do

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the shields on their arms so they do

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.539 
the shields on their arms so they do
have<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> plus<00:01:57.960> 10<00:01:58.170> HP<00:01:58.380> upgrade<00:01:58.979> finished<00:01:59.340> and

have the plus 10 HP upgrade finished and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.980 
have the plus 10 HP upgrade finished and
it<00:01:59.790> looks<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.969> stim<00:02:00.240> package<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.810> come

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it looks like stim package just come

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
it looks like stim package just come
online<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> he's<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> put<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.759> of

online and he's going to put a lot of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
online and he's going to put a lot of
pressure<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.509> early<00:02:03.990> expansion<00:02:04.229> from

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
pressure on this early expansion from

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
pressure on this early expansion from
White<00:02:04.860> Rock<00:02:05.040> actually<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> guess<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.180> not

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
White Rock actually I guess it's not

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
White Rock actually I guess it's not
that<00:02:06.479> early<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.110> zealots<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.710> have

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that early now but zealots do have

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.359 
that early now but zealots do have
charged<00:02:08.190> up<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.610> running

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
charged up and running

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.070 
charged up and running
so<00:02:09.489> these<00:02:09.700> Marines<00:02:10.119> are<00:02:10.299> going<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.629> have<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.959> do

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
so these Marines are going to have to do

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.720 
so these Marines are going to have to do
a<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.349> bit<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.560> fancy<00:02:11.890> footwork<00:02:12.340> here<00:02:12.610> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
a little bit of fancy footwork here and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.130 
a little bit of fancy footwork here and
try<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:12.909> keep<00:02:13.090> by<00:02:13.390> themselves<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:13.959> bit

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
try to keep by themselves a little bit

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.809 
try to keep by themselves a little bit
of<00:02:14.200> extra<00:02:14.379> time<00:02:14.440> against<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> results<00:02:15.760> they

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
of extra time against the results they

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.339 
of extra time against the results they
managed<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> take<00:02:16.330> out<00:02:16.450> all<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.810> zealots<00:02:17.140> for

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
managed to take out all the zealots for

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.320 
managed to take out all the zealots for
more<00:02:17.560> being<00:02:17.769> warped<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.129> but<00:02:18.909> they<00:02:19.000> managed<00:02:19.299> to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
more being warped in but they managed to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.550 
more being warped in but they managed to
take<00:02:19.540> out<00:02:19.629> those<00:02:19.780> stalkers<00:02:20.049> before<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
take out those stalkers before the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.080 
take out those stalkers before the
zealots<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:20.950> even<00:02:21.159> get<00:02:21.280> themselves<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.879> play

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
zealots can even get themselves in play

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.119 
zealots can even get themselves in play
and<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.750> looks<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:22.989> they're<00:02:23.230> possibly<00:02:23.739> going

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
and it looks like they're possibly going

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.289 
and it looks like they're possibly going
to<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.310> able<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.489> take<00:02:24.580> out<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.849> expansion

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
to be able to take out this expansion

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.149 
to be able to take out this expansion
there<00:02:25.569> are<00:02:25.659> no<00:02:25.870> more<00:02:26.079> units<00:02:26.530> all<00:02:26.890> these

marines have actually been damaged a
decent<00:02:29.079> amount<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.799> there<00:02:29.920> are<00:02:29.950> no<00:02:30.159> more

Marines<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.620> process<00:02:42.099> but<00:02:42.280> he<00:02:42.459> did<00:02:42.670> slow

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
Marines in the process but he did slow

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.699 
Marines in the process but he did slow
down<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.420> expansion<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:44.019> foreign<00:02:44.319> White<00:02:44.500> Rock

down the expansion in foreign White Rock

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.220 
down the expansion in foreign White Rock
that<00:02:45.280> much<00:02:45.549> in<00:02:45.819> actually<00:02:46.390> TLO<00:02:46.780> able<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.109> get

his own expansion up and running and he

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.490 
his own expansion up and running and he
is<00:02:49.209> actually<00:02:49.359> frantically<00:02:49.989> putting<00:02:50.319> down

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
is actually frantically putting down

is actually frantically putting down
some<00:02:51.040> bunkers<00:02:51.400> right<00:02:51.609> now<00:02:51.760> he<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:51.970> aware<00:02:52.269> that

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
some bunkers right now he is aware that

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.240 
some bunkers right now he is aware that
there<00:02:52.660> may<00:02:52.840> be<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.019> very<00:02:53.440> strong<00:02:53.709> timing<00:02:54.069> push

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
there may be a very strong timing push

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.160 
there may be a very strong timing push
coming<00:02:54.549> because<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.909> course<00:02:55.150> he<00:02:55.269> did<00:02:55.450> lose<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
coming because of course he did lose the

now<00:02:59.049> moving<00:02:59.319> out<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.769> looks<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.010> there

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
now moving out and it looks like there

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.190 
now moving out and it looks like there
is<00:03:00.190> going<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.549> be<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.670> pylon<00:03:01.150> here<00:03:01.450> using<00:03:02.109> that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
is going to be a pylon here using that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.759 
is going to be a pylon here using that
for<00:03:02.470> gate<00:03:02.680> at<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:03.370> proxy<00:03:03.790> pylon<00:03:03.940> as<00:03:04.359> a

for gate at in the proxy pylon as a

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.680 
for gate at in the proxy pylon as a
ability<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.920> reinforce<00:03:06.489> his<00:03:06.700> forces<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.659> the

ability to reinforce his forces on the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.839 
ability to reinforce his forces on the
frontline<00:03:08.349> and<00:03:08.590> these<00:03:09.069> zealots<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.459> going<00:03:09.700> to

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
frontline and these zealots are going to

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.699 
frontline and these zealots are going to
just<00:03:10.060> run<00:03:10.420> straight<00:03:10.629> by<00:03:11.019> all<00:03:11.230> those<00:03:11.349> bunkers

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
just run straight by all those bunkers

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.140 
just run straight by all those bunkers
that<00:03:11.769> are<00:03:11.950> fortifying<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.700> front<00:03:13.030> position

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
that are fortifying that front position

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.330 
that are fortifying that front position
and<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:14.260> looks<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.530> he<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:14.829> going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.160> try<00:03:15.310> to

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
and it looks like he is going to try to

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.819 
and it looks like he is going to try to
get<00:03:15.519> into<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.970> base<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.389> TLO<00:03:16.870> possibly<00:03:17.650> try<00:03:17.799> to

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
get into the base of TLO possibly try to

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.470 
get into the base of TLO possibly try to
do<00:03:18.040> some<00:03:18.220> damage<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.880> mineral<00:03:19.180> line<00:03:19.299> but

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
do some damage on the mineral line but

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
do some damage on the mineral line but
there<00:03:19.660> are<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.900> lot<00:03:20.319> of<00:03:20.349> Marines<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.980> pursuit

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
there are a lot of Marines in pursuit

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.099 
there are a lot of Marines in pursuit
right<00:03:21.489> now<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:21.910> using<00:03:22.419> that<00:03:22.569> chargeability

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
right now and using that chargeability

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.449 
right now and using that chargeability
you<00:03:23.319> can<00:03:23.470> see<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.739> zealots<00:03:24.010> able<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.280> get<00:03:24.370> in

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
you can see the zealots able to get in

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.309 
you can see the zealots able to get in
and<00:03:24.519> get<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.700> couple<00:03:24.910> hits<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.810> there<00:03:26.019> are<00:03:26.139> just

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
and get a couple hits but there are just

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.780 
and get a couple hits but there are just
too<00:03:26.530> many<00:03:26.560> Marines<00:03:27.040> for<00:03:27.250> these<00:03:27.370> zealots<00:03:27.579> to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
too many Marines for these zealots to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.940 
too many Marines for these zealots to
handle<00:03:28.090> right<00:03:28.239> now<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.629> white<00:03:29.290> rod<00:03:29.500> if<00:03:29.709> he's

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
handle right now and white rod if he's

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.470 
handle right now and white rod if he's
not<00:03:30.099> careful<00:03:30.310> these<00:03:30.639> Murray<00:03:30.849> these<00:03:31.209> outlets

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
not careful these Murray these outlets

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.900 
not careful these Murray these outlets
are<00:03:31.629> just<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.079> basically<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:33.099> cut<00:03:33.730> down

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
are just going to basically get cut down

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.610 
are just going to basically get cut down
by<00:03:34.120> those<00:03:34.359> Marines<00:03:34.690> without<00:03:35.019> actually<00:03:35.470> doing

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
by those Marines without actually doing

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.710 
by those Marines without actually doing
anything<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:36.849> looks<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.180> they<00:03:37.299> are<00:03:37.329> able<00:03:37.540> to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
anything it looks like they are able to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.170 
anything it looks like they are able to
take<00:03:37.900> out<00:03:38.049> one<00:03:38.440> two<00:03:38.829> SUVs<00:03:39.459> maybe<00:03:39.819> three

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
take out one two SUVs maybe three

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.240 
take out one two SUVs maybe three
getting<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.870> couple<00:03:41.139> of<00:03:41.230> seb<00:03:41.530> s<00:03:41.739> but<00:03:41.980> they<00:03:42.099> get

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
getting a couple of seb s but they get

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.869 
getting a couple of seb s but they get
trapped<00:03:42.549> by<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.389> supply<00:03:43.750> depot<00:03:44.049> an<00:03:44.169> SUV<00:03:44.470> wall

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
trapped by this supply depot an SUV wall

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.039 
trapped by this supply depot an SUV wall
which<00:03:45.879> I<00:03:46.060> don't<00:03:46.209> think<00:03:46.419> that<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:46.599> was<00:03:46.810> really

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
which I don't think that that was really

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.479 
which I don't think that that was really
the<00:03:47.079> maximum<00:03:47.470> amount<00:03:47.560> damage<00:03:47.980> although<00:03:48.129> he<00:03:48.340> is

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
the maximum amount damage although he is

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.250 
the maximum amount damage although he is
moving<00:03:48.790> an<00:03:48.879> army<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.540> front<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.930> Tillis

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
moving an army it's the front of Tillis

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.809 
moving an army it's the front of Tillis
base<00:03:50.470> trying<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.190> take<00:03:51.310> down<00:03:51.340> some<00:03:51.669> of<00:03:51.699> these

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
base trying to take down some of these

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.280 
base trying to take down some of these
bunkers<00:03:52.209> since<00:03:52.389> they<00:03:52.510> do<00:03:52.569> not<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:52.840> any<00:03:53.139> use

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
bunkers since they do not have any use

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.960 
bunkers since they do not have any use
and<00:03:53.500> I'm<00:03:53.590> currently<00:03:53.980> putting<00:03:54.549> some<00:03:54.790> horse

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and I'm currently putting some horse

and I'm currently putting some horse
skip<00:03:55.150> down<00:03:55.269> on<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.629> map<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.019> somehow<00:03:56.290> one<00:03:56.620> of

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
skip down on the map and somehow one of

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.809 
skip down on the map and somehow one of
those<00:03:56.799> force<00:03:57.010> fields<00:03:57.040> getting<00:03:57.489> taken<00:03:57.790> down

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
those force fields getting taken down

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.030 
those force fields getting taken down
I'm<00:03:58.540> not<00:03:58.690> sure<00:03:58.750> exactly<00:03:59.230> how<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.500> Portugal

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
I'm not sure exactly how that Portugal

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.250 
I'm not sure exactly how that Portugal
got<00:04:00.220> taken<00:04:00.430> down<00:04:00.609> straight<00:04:00.879> away<00:04:01.079> because<00:04:02.079> i

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
got taken down straight away because i

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.869 
got taken down straight away because i
thought<00:04:02.590> were<00:04:02.829> still<00:04:03.040> only<00:04:03.250> got<00:04:03.430> taken<00:04:03.669> down

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
thought were still only got taken down

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.130 
thought were still only got taken down
by<00:04:04.090> massive<00:04:04.540> units

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
by massive units

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.920 
by massive units
so<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:06.280> not<00:04:06.520> sure<00:04:06.580> hopeful<00:04:07.150> i<00:04:07.240> exactly<00:04:07.720> that

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
so I'm not sure hopeful i exactly that

so I'm not sure hopeful i exactly that
fortunate<00:04:08.319> got<00:04:08.440> cancelled<00:04:08.890> but<00:04:09.340> anyways<00:04:09.790> it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
fortunate got cancelled but anyways it

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.449 
fortunate got cancelled but anyways it
looks<00:04:10.209> like<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.780> forces<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.680> kylo<00:04:12.160> are<00:04:12.280> going

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
looks like the forces of kylo are going

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.430 
looks like the forces of kylo are going
to<00:04:12.520> be<00:04:12.580> able<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.819> push<00:04:12.970> back<00:04:13.209> whiterose<00:04:13.930> army

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
to be able to push back whiterose army

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.199 
to be able to push back whiterose army
in<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.830> one<00:04:15.250> stock<00:04:15.550> are<00:04:15.730> getting<00:04:15.940> hanging

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
in that one stock are getting hanging

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.910 
in that one stock are getting hanging
down<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.989> looks<00:04:17.140> like<00:04:17.230> he<00:04:17.320> is<00:04:17.440> trying<00:04:17.620> to

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
down and it looks like he is trying to

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.530 
down and it looks like he is trying to
bring<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.430> some<00:04:18.609> more<00:04:18.730> soccer's<00:04:19.150> here<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.359> hold

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
bring in some more soccer's here to hold

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.509 
bring in some more soccer's here to hold
the<00:04:19.660> stored<00:04:19.900> position<00:04:20.049> but<00:04:20.590> he<00:04:21.040> loses<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
the stored position but he loses the

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.920 
the stored position but he loses the
probe<00:04:21.730> and<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.000> looks<00:04:22.150> like<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> proxy<00:04:22.780> pylon

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
probe and it looks like the proxy pylon

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.040 
probe and it looks like the proxy pylon
is<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.830> go<00:04:23.980> down<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.430> there<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.210> lone

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
is going to go down and there is a lone

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.230 
is going to go down and there is a lone
Viking<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.890> base<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.280> White<00:04:27.460> Rock<00:04:27.490> just

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
Viking in the base of White Rock just

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.820 
Viking in the base of White Rock just
tearing<00:04:28.600> up<00:04:28.720> some<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:29.080> his<00:04:29.230> workers<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.770> it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
tearing up some of his workers and it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.140 
tearing up some of his workers and it
looks<00:04:29.980> like<00:04:30.040> it's<00:04:30.160> actually<00:04:30.610> got<00:04:30.730> two<00:04:30.910> kills

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
looks like it's actually got two kills

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.180 
looks like it's actually got two kills
already<00:04:31.510> now<00:04:32.050> make<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.440> three<00:04:32.680> kills<00:04:32.919> and

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
already now make it three kills and

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.870 
already now make it three kills and

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
white rot is going to GG so why try

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.110 
white rot is going to GG so why try
absolutely<00:04:37.780> not<00:04:37.900> able<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.350> keep<00:04:38.530> up<00:04:38.770> with<00:04:39.120> tloz

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
absolutely not able to keep up with tloz

absolutely not able to keep up with tloz
marine<00:04:40.600> army<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.200> looks<00:04:41.380> like<00:04:41.590> which<00:04:41.830> he

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
marine army it looks like which he

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.290 
marine army it looks like which he
actually<00:04:42.130> towards<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.700> end<00:04:42.820> there<00:04:42.880> got<00:04:43.150> some

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
actually towards the end there got some

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.880 
actually towards the end there got some
Vikings<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:43.960> Marauders<00:04:44.320> in<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.500> mix<00:04:44.680> as<00:04:44.860> well

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
Vikings and Marauders in the mix as well

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.790 
Vikings and Marauders in the mix as well
but<00:04:45.640> pretty<00:04:45.880> much<00:04:45.940> went<00:04:46.419> largely<00:04:46.780> Marines<00:04:47.530> for

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
but pretty much went largely Marines for

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.560 
but pretty much went largely Marines for
most<00:04:48.040> of<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.400> game<00:04:48.430> there<00:04:48.910> but<00:04:49.360> some<00:04:49.540> very

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
most of the game there but some very

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.080 
most of the game there but some very
back<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.169> forth<00:04:50.380> action<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.980> initially<00:04:51.940> like

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
back and forth action and initially like

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.460 
back and forth action and initially like
i<00:04:52.210> mentioned<00:04:52.270> i<00:04:52.600> thought<00:04:52.780> TLO<00:04:53.140> was<00:04:53.260> going<00:04:53.380> to

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
i mentioned i thought TLO was going to

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.780 
i mentioned i thought TLO was going to
take<00:04:53.590> that<00:04:53.740> fast<00:04:54.010> expansion<00:04:54.400> with<00:04:54.669> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
take that fast expansion with the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.850 
take that fast expansion with the
orbital<00:04:55.060> command<00:04:55.270> he<00:04:55.450> built<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.750> his<00:04:55.810> base<00:04:56.080> but

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
orbital command he built in his base but

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.290 
orbital command he built in his base but
actually<00:04:57.220> just<00:04:57.400> using<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:57.700> as<00:04:57.820> part<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.180> his

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
actually just using that as part of his

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.880 
actually just using that as part of his
wall<00:04:58.540> for<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> long<00:04:59.020> time<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.530> using<00:04:59.680> the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
wall for a long time and using the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.980 
wall for a long time and using the

energy force can sweep and mules while

energy force can sweep and mules while
he<00:05:02.230> waited<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.770> opportunity<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.400> move

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
he waited for the opportunity to move

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.770 
he waited for the opportunity to move
out<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.790> take<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.060> expansion<00:05:04.419> then<00:05:04.660> of

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
out and take that expansion then of

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.930 
out and take that expansion then of
course<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.500> excellent<00:05:06.130> timing<00:05:06.370> taking<00:05:06.820> down

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
course the excellent timing taking down

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.580 
course the excellent timing taking down
the<00:05:07.090> Nexus<00:05:07.450> not<00:05:07.630> long<00:05:07.870> after<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.290> was<00:05:08.380> finished

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the Nexus not long after it was finished

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.530 
the Nexus not long after it was finished
and<00:05:08.890> using<00:05:09.550> those<00:05:09.640> marines<00:05:10.000> with<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.300> stim

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540

packing the shield upgrade to just kite
those<00:05:12.280> zealots<00:05:12.490> around<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.180> buy<00:05:13.930> him<00:05:14.080> enough

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
those zealots around and buy him enough

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.230 
those zealots around and buy him enough
time<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.590> take<00:05:14.919> down<00:05:15.100> that<00:05:15.160> Nexus<00:05:15.669> expansion

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
time to take down that Nexus expansion

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.659 
time to take down that Nexus expansion
which<00:05:16.360> really<00:05:16.660> put<00:05:17.530> him<00:05:17.710> way<00:05:18.040> in<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.280> lead<00:05:18.460> as

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
which really put him way in the lead as

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.280 
which really put him way in the lead as
he<00:05:18.700> was<00:05:19.000> able<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.240> get<00:05:19.330> his<00:05:19.510> own<00:05:19.690> expansion<00:05:19.990> up

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
he was able to get his own expansion up

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.170 
he was able to get his own expansion up
and<00:05:20.440> running<00:05:20.680> at<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.010> same<00:05:21.160> time<00:05:21.430> anyways

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
and running at the same time anyways

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.250 
and running at the same time anyways
both<00:05:22.450> of<00:05:22.600> these<00:05:22.660> guys<00:05:22.870> are<00:05:22.900> high-level

players this was a very fun game to

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.820 
players this was a very fun game to
watch<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.140> I<00:05:26.169> will<00:05:26.350> definitely<00:05:26.500> be<00:05:26.800> looking

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
