you're done since this cube is new there
really<00:00:41.879> isn't<00:00:42.120> any<00:00:42.270> excess<00:00:42.840> stuff<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:44.129> I

would<00:00:44.489> always<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.480> figure<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:46.020> like

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
would always I just figure this out like

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.580 
would always I just figure this out like
recommend<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.270> rubbing<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.110> side<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
set to the ones i solve with like Mike

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
set to the ones i solve with like Mike
Ross<00:01:11.070> climbing<00:01:11.430> stuff<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.420> after<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.930> off
