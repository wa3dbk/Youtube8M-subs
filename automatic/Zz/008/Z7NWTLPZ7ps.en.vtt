00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
many years and certainly filled a niche

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.149 
many years and certainly filled a niche
there<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.670> felt<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.389> I'm<00:03:16.109> not<00:03:16.889> capable

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
there that I felt like I'm not capable

there that I felt like I'm not capable
of<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.609> plus<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.359> don't<00:03:18.540> want<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.139> so

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
of that plus I don't want to do that so

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.259 
of that plus I don't want to do that so
and<00:03:19.769> that's<00:03:20.010> already<00:03:20.190> taken<00:03:20.790> care<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.209> I

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
and that's already taken care of so I

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.089 
and that's already taken care of so I
thought<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:21.750> could<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.079> something<00:03:22.349> for
