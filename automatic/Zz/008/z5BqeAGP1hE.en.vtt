00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
so here is Cyclops probably the most

basic<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> figures<00:00:30.090> that's<00:00:30.269> why<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
basic of all the figures that's why I

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.750 
basic of all the figures that's why I
wanted<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> start<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.140> him<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.519> may

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760

wanted to start with him as you may
notice<00:00:33.059> he<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:35.460> bunkie<00:00:35.760> cat<00:00:36.000> mold<00:00:36.269> which

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
notice he is the bunkie cat mold which

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
notice he is the bunkie cat mold which
has<00:00:36.780> been<00:00:36.960> reused<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.620> whole<00:00:38.040> bunch<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
has been reused a whole bunch it's a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.979 
has been reused a whole bunch it's a
pretty<00:00:38.910> decent<00:00:39.120> mold<00:00:39.449> so<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:39.840> gonna

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
pretty decent mold so I'm not gonna

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
pretty decent mold so I'm not gonna
fault<00:00:40.290> them<00:00:40.470> for<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.879> but<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> being<00:00:42.300> said

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
fault them for that but that being said

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.889 
fault them for that but that being said
there's<00:00:43.019> almost<00:00:43.850> nothing<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.600> figure

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there's almost nothing to this figure

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.010 
there's almost nothing to this figure
you<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.739> two<00:00:46.920> fisted<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.940> fisted<00:00:48.329> hands<00:00:48.570> two

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you have two fisted two fisted hands two

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.029 
you have two fisted two fisted hands two
clenched<00:00:49.739> fist<00:00:50.219> hands<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> belt<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.770> newly

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
clenched fist hands a belt and a newly

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
clenched fist hands a belt and a newly
sculpted<00:00:53.250> head<00:00:53.670> everything<00:00:54.300> else<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> just

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
sculpted head everything else is just

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
sculpted head everything else is just
plain<00:00:55.200> old<00:00:55.379> figure<00:00:55.739> there's<00:00:56.219> no<00:00:56.460> sculpt<00:00:56.850> work

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
plain old figure there's no sculpt work

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.610 
plain old figure there's no sculpt work
on<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> little<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:57.960> disappointing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
on it so it's a little bit disappointing

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310 
on it so it's a little bit disappointing
I<00:00:58.710> think<00:00:59.070> he<00:00:59.969> stands<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.719> six<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.170> half

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I think he stands about six and a half

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.540 
I think he stands about six and a half
inches<00:01:01.620> tall<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.860> that's<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.430> would

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
inches tall so that's what we would

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
inches tall so that's what we would
expect<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.510> belt<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> sculpted<00:01:04.379> well<00:01:04.559> enough

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
expect the belt is sculpted well enough

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.100 
expect the belt is sculpted well enough
it's<00:01:05.430> okay<00:01:05.789> I<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.270> prefer<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.750> version

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's okay I kind of prefer the version

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.900 
it's okay I kind of prefer the version
of<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> outfit<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> belt<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:08.700> some

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
of this outfit where the belt has some

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.510 
of this outfit where the belt has some
more<00:01:09.060> color<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:10.229> slightly<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:10.890> black

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
more color to it it's slightly off black

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.990 
more color to it it's slightly off black
it<00:01:11.759> looks<00:01:11.789> Brown<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.890> super<00:01:14.369> dark

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it looks Brown to me but it's super dark

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
it looks Brown to me but it's super dark
it's<00:01:15.539> super<00:01:15.959> super<00:01:16.080> dark<00:01:16.440> so<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.679> looks<00:01:16.950> black

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's super super dark so it looks black

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.680 
it's super super dark so it looks black
I<00:01:17.490> prefer<00:01:17.849> the<00:01:18.000> belt<00:01:18.209> where<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.539> lot

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
I prefer the belt where it's a lot

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.690 
I prefer the belt where it's a lot
lighter<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.289> I<00:01:19.619> prefer<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.190> version<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.550> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
lighter and I prefer the version of the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.029 
lighter and I prefer the version of the
Cyclops<00:01:21.119> where<00:01:21.479> he's<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.259> glove<00:01:22.560> details

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
Cyclops where he's got glove details

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.999 
Cyclops where he's got glove details
going<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> figure<00:01:24.929> has<00:01:25.110> no<00:01:25.440> sculpted

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
going on this figure has no sculpted

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
going on this figure has no sculpted
details<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> entire<00:01:26.880> bodysuit<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.810> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
details on the entire bodysuit so all we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.540 
details on the entire bodysuit so all we
really<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.560> these<00:01:28.679> painted<00:01:29.099> red<00:01:29.220> lines

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
really have are these painted red lines

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.960 
really have are these painted red lines
and<00:01:30.349> so<00:01:31.349> it's<00:01:31.709> a<00:01:31.800> little<00:01:32.009> bit<00:01:32.280> disappointing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and so it's a little bit disappointing

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.210 
and so it's a little bit disappointing
we<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> newly<00:01:33.750> sculpted<00:01:33.990> head<00:01:34.440> which

we do have the newly sculpted head which
the<00:01:35.399> sculpt<00:01:35.670> seems<00:01:36.030> okay<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.660> really

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the sculpt seems okay I'm not really

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240 
the sculpt seems okay I'm not really
complaining<00:01:37.050> about<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.590> sculpt<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> head

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
complaining about the sculpt on the head

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.559 
complaining about the sculpt on the head
it<00:01:38.369> looks<00:01:38.520> fine<00:01:38.789> but<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:40.050> paint<00:01:40.259> job<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
be orange for the visor part and not for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.919 
be orange for the visor part and not for
the<00:01:59.789> rest<00:01:59.970> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.209> suit<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.599> thought<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
the rest of the suit but I thought it

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.320 
the rest of the suit but I thought it
was<00:02:01.020> all<00:02:01.170> red<00:02:01.489> like<00:02:02.489> I<00:02:02.580> said<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.940> it's<00:02:03.090> supposed

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
was all red like I said if it's supposed

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.520 
was all red like I said if it's supposed
to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.479> red<00:02:03.690> then<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:03.929> totally<00:02:04.259> missed<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to be red then they totally missed the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.839 
to be red then they totally missed the
mark<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.009> supposed<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.429> orange<00:02:05.670> then

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
mark if it's supposed to be orange then

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.089 
mark if it's supposed to be orange then
it's<00:02:06.000> perfectly<00:02:06.390> fine<00:02:06.599> so<00:02:06.920> that's<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's perfectly fine so that's not a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.540 
it's perfectly fine so that's not a
complaint<00:02:08.520> necessarily<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.340> lack

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
complaint necessarily but the the lack

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.210 
complaint necessarily but the the lack
of<00:02:11.580> properly<00:02:12.480> painting<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> visor<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.620> just

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
of properly painting the visor is just

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.729 
of properly painting the visor is just
horribly<00:02:15.000> reducing<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> enjoy<00:02:16.140> ability<00:02:16.560> of

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
horribly reducing the enjoy ability of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
this figure the red lines are okay

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.280 
this figure the red lines are okay
there's<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> lot<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.570> scratch<00:02:21.900> marks

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
there's a lot of like scratch marks

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.430 
there's a lot of like scratch marks

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
down there that's not good it should go

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
here and here it's just just doesn't

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.580 
here and here it's just just doesn't
look<00:02:47.060> very<00:02:47.090> good<00:02:47.330> for<00:02:47.600> such<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> simple<00:02:48.350> paint

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
look very good for such a simple paint

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.500 
look very good for such a simple paint
job<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.100> not<00:02:49.220> giving<00:02:49.550> us<00:02:49.670> any<00:02:49.910> sculpted

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
job and not giving us any sculpted

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.690 
job and not giving us any sculpted
detail<00:02:50.870> at<00:02:51.020> all<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.950> know<00:02:52.070> they<00:02:52.310> didn't<00:02:52.580> make

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
detail at all you know they didn't make

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.610 
detail at all you know they didn't make
us<00:02:52.880> anything<00:02:53.300> new<00:02:53.480> except<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.080> think<00:02:54.440> maybe

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
us anything new except I think maybe

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.200 
us anything new except I think maybe
they<00:02:54.860> had<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.070> make<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.220> new<00:02:55.430> fist<00:02:55.670> hand<00:02:55.910> maybe

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
they had to make a new fist hand maybe

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.330 
they had to make a new fist hand maybe
both<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.510> them<00:02:56.810> then<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.680> belt<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.160> head

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
both of them then the belt in the head

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.190 
both of them then the belt in the head
that's<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.120> I've<00:02:59.240> figured<00:02:59.510> for<00:02:59.930> a

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
that's it so I've figured for a

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440 
that's it so I've figured for a
completely<00:03:01.190> blank<00:03:01.430> figure<00:03:01.730> with<00:03:01.880> not<00:03:02.060> nothing

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
completely blank figure with not nothing

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
completely blank figure with not nothing
but<00:03:02.600> paint<00:03:02.840> they<00:03:02.990> would<00:03:03.140> have<00:03:03.230> done<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> better

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
but paint they would have done a better

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.200 
but paint they would have done a better
job<00:03:03.710> on<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> paint<00:03:04.340> job<00:03:04.400> there's<00:03:04.790> no<00:03:04.820> shading

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
job on the paint job there's no shading

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.620 
job on the paint job there's no shading
on<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.540> black<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.830> very<00:03:07.490> mediocre<00:03:08.090> at

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
on the black it's just very mediocre at

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.310 
on the black it's just very mediocre at
best

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
best

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.080 
best

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
type of situation we already know the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.820 
type of situation we already know the
articulation<00:03:11.690> for<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:11.990> guy<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.170> that's<00:03:12.530> fine

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
articulation for this guy so that's fine

ankles so the legs look a little bit off
it's<00:03:24.890> not<00:03:25.010> horrible<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.490> gotta<00:03:25.670> say<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.910> doesn't

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
it's not horrible I gotta say it doesn't

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.460

I'm<00:03:27.890> not<00:03:28.040> really<00:03:28.160> complaining<00:03:28.340> about<00:03:28.730> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
I'm not really complaining about the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.550 
I'm not really complaining about the
sculpt<00:03:29.270> other<00:03:29.480> than<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.840> fact<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.350> legs

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
sculpt other than the fact that the legs

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.610 
sculpt other than the fact that the legs
don't<00:03:30.770> line<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.900> just<00:03:33.020> a<00:03:33.170> really

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
don't line up so it's just a really

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.010 
don't line up so it's just a really
mediocre<00:03:34.040> figure<00:03:34.760> if<00:03:34.880> you're<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> huge<00:03:35.450> cyclops

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
mediocre figure if you're a huge cyclops

not it's it's very mediocre kind of
thing<00:03:46.540> when<00:03:47.540> they<00:03:47.780> make<00:03:48.050> this<00:03:48.260> figure<00:03:48.620> instead

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
thing when they make this figure instead

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.010 
thing when they make this figure instead
of<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.130> Phoenix<00:03:49.700> Cyclops<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.720> we<00:03:50.900> were

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
of the Phoenix Cyclops that we were

of the Phoenix Cyclops that we were
promised<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.530> while<00:03:51.709> ago<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:53.120> makes<00:03:53.330> me<00:03:53.480> a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
promised a while ago it makes me a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.820 
promised a while ago it makes me a
little<00:03:53.630> bit<00:03:53.780> upset<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:54.410> because<00:03:54.530> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
little bit upset just because the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.800 
little bit upset just because the
Phoenix<00:03:55.250> Cyclops<00:03:55.670> it<00:03:56.420> would<00:03:56.600> have<00:03:56.690> been<00:03:56.780> a

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
Phoenix Cyclops it would have been a

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.229 
Phoenix Cyclops it would have been a
much<00:03:57.140> cooler<00:03:57.800> figure<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.400> have<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.060> one

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
much cooler figure to have and this one

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.360 
much cooler figure to have and this one
is<00:03:59.390> just<00:03:59.600> so<00:04:00.070> bland<00:04:01.070> really<00:04:02.030> unimpressive<00:04:02.900> but

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
is just so bland really unimpressive but

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.670 
is just so bland really unimpressive but
you<00:04:04.370> know<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:05.239> looks<00:04:05.540> okay<00:04:05.870> on<00:04:06.019> a<00:04:06.050> shelf<00:04:06.380> if<00:04:06.590> you

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
you know it looks okay on a shelf if you

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.140 
you know it looks okay on a shelf if you
don't<00:04:06.830> look<00:04:06.890> at<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.160> too<00:04:07.310> close<00:04:07.610> it's<00:04:08.000> just

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
don't look at it too close it's just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.990 
don't look at it too close it's just
really<00:04:08.510> otherwise<00:04:09.140> just<00:04:09.980> there<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.459> not<00:04:10.760> much

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
really otherwise just there is not much

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.360 
really otherwise just there is not much
to<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.269> at<00:04:11.690> all<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.560> I<00:04:12.590> guess<00:04:12.769> that's<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.160> guys
