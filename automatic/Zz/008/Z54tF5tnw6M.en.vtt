00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
light just like that and slightly maybe

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.470 
light just like that and slightly maybe
I<00:04:27.060> see<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.930> greenish<00:04:28.260> glow<00:04:29.330> I'll<00:04:30.330> be

I see kind of a greenish glow I'll be

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.850 
I see kind of a greenish glow I'll be
showing<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:30.960> another<00:04:31.140> video<00:04:31.380> I'll

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
showing this in another video I'll

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.420 
showing this in another video I'll
probably<00:04:32.130> film<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.610> right<00:04:33.419> after<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:35.280> see

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
probably film it right after this to see

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.330 
probably film it right after this to see
if<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.669> has<00:04:35.850> an<00:04:35.940> effect

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.520 

I<00:04:41.340> remembered<00:04:41.700> us<00:04:41.820> this<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.600> solar<00:04:43.169> charger

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
I remembered us this is a solar charger

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.040 
I remembered us this is a solar charger
thought<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:44.370> would<00:04:44.550> be<00:04:44.580> cool<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.540> try<00:04:45.780> out

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
thought this would be cool to try out

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.770 
thought this would be cool to try out
for<00:04:46.530> my<00:04:47.010> ipod<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:49.230> is<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.740> charger<00:04:50.780> so

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
for my ipod and it is a charger so

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.530 
for my ipod and it is a charger so
literature<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:53.150> doubted<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.240> would<00:04:54.270> work

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
literature that is doubted it would work

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.120 
literature that is doubted it would work
I<00:04:55.080> mean<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.010> was<00:04:56.130> only<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.729> dollar<00:04:57.660> no<00:04:58.350> my<00:04:58.890> dollar

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
I mean it was only a dollar no my dollar

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.880 
I mean it was only a dollar no my dollar
maybe<00:04:59.490> like<00:04:59.700> four<00:04:59.940> dollars<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:00.800> think<00:05:01.800> this

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
maybe like four dollars I think this

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.790 
maybe like four dollars I think this
will<00:05:02.040> be<00:05:02.160> in<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.370> description<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.880> course

there you go as well film on it which

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.850 
there you go as well film on it which
I'll<00:05:07.890> take<00:05:08.100> off<00:05:08.540> so<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.870> floor<00:05:10.380> panel<00:05:10.680> doesn't

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
I'll take off so the floor panel doesn't

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:20.140 
I'll take off so the floor panel doesn't
get<00:05:11.070> scratched<00:05:11.810> there's<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.900> plug<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.530> then

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:32.930 

look<00:05:21.150> if<00:05:21.419> there's<00:05:21.690> any<00:05:21.960> details<00:05:22.680> on<00:05:22.830> here<00:05:31.940> with

Appalachian Trail for summer
we<00:05:45.570> have<00:05:46.880> seen<00:05:47.880> these<00:05:48.690> IDs<00:05:49.110> so<00:05:49.980> I<00:05:50.040> got<00:05:50.190> two

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
we have seen these IDs so I got two

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.910 
we have seen these IDs so I got two
packs<00:05:50.670> of<00:05:50.880> these<00:05:51.000> these<00:05:51.990> are<00:05:52.170> basically<00:05:52.560> twist

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
packs of these these are basically twist

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.310 
packs of these these are basically twist
ties<00:05:53.160> kind<00:05:53.970> of<00:05:54.030> like<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.360> night<00:05:54.570> eyes<00:05:54.840> twist

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.370 
ties kind of like the night eyes twist
ties<00:05:56.060> but<00:05:57.060> I'm<00:05:57.270> hoping<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.750> would<00:05:58.320> work<00:05:58.560> on

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
ties but I'm hoping that would work on

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.560 
ties but I'm hoping that would work on
my<00:06:01.380> buck<00:06:01.710> display<00:06:02.220> case<00:06:02.960> that's<00:06:05.450> totally<00:06:06.450> not
