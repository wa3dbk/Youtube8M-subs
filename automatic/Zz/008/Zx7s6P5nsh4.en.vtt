wants to hold his sword and he just tips

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:11.140 
wants to hold his sword and he just tips
it<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.670> clip<00:01:09.330> his<00:01:09.540> legs<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
it on and then you can clip his legs to

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:20.090 
it on and then you can clip his legs to
the<00:01:12.150> back<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> ninja<00:01:13.530> bladder<00:01:19.100> although

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the back of the ninja bladder although

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.929 
the back of the ninja bladder although
the<00:01:20.909> other<00:01:21.270> way<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.470> clip<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> ninja<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the other way to clip the ninja on is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.260 
the other way to clip the ninja on is
much<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.600> stable<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.520> he<00:01:26.520> doesn't<00:01:26.939> fall<00:01:27.240> off

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
much more stable and he doesn't fall off

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.850 
much more stable and he doesn't fall off
that<00:01:27.689> much<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.650> ninja<00:01:32.040> glider<00:01:32.310> itself<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
that much so the ninja glider itself is

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.969 
that much so the ninja glider itself is
awesome<00:01:35.420> he<00:01:36.420> uses<00:01:37.369> six<00:01:38.420> ninja<00:01:39.420> swords<00:01:39.979> over

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
awesome he uses six ninja swords over

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.219 
awesome he uses six ninja swords over
for<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> wings<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.530> gold<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
for the wings and they are in gold and

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
for the wings and they are in gold and
they're<00:01:46.229> very<00:01:46.590> rare<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.610> only<00:01:47.850> get

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
they're very rare as you can only get

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
they're very rare as you can only get
them<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:50.130> ninja<00:01:50.909> go<00:01:51.180> set<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.189> think<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
them in one ninja go set I think and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.660 
them in one ninja go set I think and
that<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> set<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.979> only<00:01:56.219> get<00:01:56.430> one

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that and then that set you only get one

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.310 
that and then that set you only get one
of<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.360> great<00:02:00.780> way<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> get

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of these so this is a great way to get

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.749 
of these so this is a great way to get
loads<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> salt<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.439> see<00:02:05.479> there<00:02:06.479> are

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
loads of salt as you can see there are

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.510 
loads of salt as you can see there are
