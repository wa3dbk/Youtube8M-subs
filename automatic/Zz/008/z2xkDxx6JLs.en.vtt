00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
first obviously it did so much hype and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.280 
first obviously it did so much hype and
stuff<00:02:05.670> around<00:02:05.939> Sergio<00:02:06.390> Ramos<00:02:06.570> who<00:02:06.930> could

possibly<00:02:07.590> still<00:02:08.099> happen<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:09.179> unlikely

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
possibly still happen is more unlikely

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
possibly still happen is more unlikely
now<00:02:09.869> compared<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.770> last<00:02:11.039> week<00:02:11.280> because

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
now compared to like last week because

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.180 
now compared to like last week because
of<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.940> fact<00:02:12.150> he<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.110> pretty<00:02:13.620> much<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:13.950> of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
of the fact he is pretty much I think of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.470 
of the fact he is pretty much I think of
the<00:02:14.250> name<00:02:14.459> where<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:14.790> your<00:02:14.879> captain's<00:02:15.360> we'd

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the name where would your captain's we'd

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.790 
the name where would your captain's we'd
probably<00:02:15.720> no<00:02:15.900> gakuen<00:02:16.170> anymore<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:16.770> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
probably no gakuen anymore but it's a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.460 
probably no gakuen anymore but it's a
potential<00:02:17.459> one<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.300> go<00:02:18.420> alongside<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.230> other

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.460 
potential one to go alongside this other
one<00:02:19.739> that's<00:02:20.010> been<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.700> much<00:02:20.879> speculation

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
one that's been so much speculation
