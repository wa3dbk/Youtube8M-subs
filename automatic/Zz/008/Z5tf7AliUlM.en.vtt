exist pre-existing hole here and this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.270 
exist pre-existing hole here and this
one<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:39.290> will<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> install<00:00:40.770> Hardware

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
one here will have to install Hardware

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.729 
one here will have to install Hardware
inside<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> frame<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> we'll<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.500> hole

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
inside the frame and we'll use this hole

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
inside the frame and we'll use this hole
here<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:45.059> access<00:00:45.390> hole<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.719> install

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
here as our access hole to install

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
here as our access hole to install
Hardware<00:00:46.320> we'll<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.160> ahead<00:00:47.219> take<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> look<00:00:47.579> at

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
Hardware we'll go ahead take a look at

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
Hardware we'll go ahead take a look at
driver<00:00:47.879> side<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.690> pretty<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.020> be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
driver side which will pretty much be

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.799 
driver side which will pretty much be
the<00:00:49.260> same<00:00:49.350> thing<00:00:52.699> this<00:00:53.699> hole<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the same thing this hole here and this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
the same thing this hole here and this
hole<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.829> an<00:00:55.920> access<00:00:56.250> hole<00:00:56.520> right

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
hole here we have an access hole right

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.970 
hole here we have an access hole right
here<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.539> well

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.829 

so<00:01:00.460> typically<00:01:00.910> your<00:01:01.059> next<00:01:01.359> step<00:01:01.539> would<00:01:01.660> be<00:01:01.719> to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
so typically your next step would be to

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.259 
so typically your next step would be to
go<00:01:02.050> ahead<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.589> unload<00:01:03.190> exhaust<00:01:03.640> gears<00:01:04.000> more

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
go ahead and unload exhaust gears more

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.749 
go ahead and unload exhaust gears more
work<00:01:04.560> in<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.680> case<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.040> think<00:01:06.070> we're<00:01:06.340> going<00:01:06.460> we

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
work in this case I think we're going we

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.070 
work in this case I think we're going we
don't<00:01:06.850> really<00:01:07.090> need<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:07.360> take<00:01:07.509> that<00:01:07.570> down<00:01:07.869> so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
don't really need to take that down so

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.330 
don't really need to take that down so
you<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.259> plenty<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.590> working<00:01:08.770> room<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.159> fact

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
you have plenty of working room in fact

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.700 
you have plenty of working room in fact
we'll<00:01:09.580> use<00:01:09.729> exhaust<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.360> our<00:01:10.479> advantage<00:01:10.750> now

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
we'll use exhaust to our advantage now

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.230 
we'll use exhaust to our advantage now

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.250 
take the driver's side and put it on top
of<00:02:27.040> our<00:02:27.099> exhaust<00:02:27.430> now<00:02:28.390> hold<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:28.870> place<00:02:28.959> for

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
of our exhaust now hold it in place for

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.839 
of our exhaust now hold it in place for
us<00:02:29.319> while<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.560> do<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.739> other<00:02:29.799> side<00:02:30.069> that's<00:02:30.640> why

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
us while we do the other side that's why

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.750 
us while we do the other side that's why
we<00:02:30.970> left<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> result<00:02:31.540> up<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.959> time<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
we left the result up this time and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.740 
we left the result up this time and
using<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.000> our<00:02:34.090> advantage<00:02:35.760> okay<00:02:36.760> then

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
using it to our advantage okay then

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.220 
using it to our advantage okay then
we'll<00:02:37.810> go<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.959> our<00:02:38.170> passenger<00:02:38.980> side<00:02:40.139> we'll<00:02:41.139> go

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
we'll go to our passenger side we'll go

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.729 
we'll go to our passenger side we'll go
ahead<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.379> push<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> into<00:02:41.769> place<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:44.379> push<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
ahead and push it into place and push it

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.660 
ahead and push it into place and push it
up<00:02:44.799> make<00:02:44.980> sure<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.159> don't<00:02:45.220> push<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.459> other

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
up make sure you don't push the other

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.849 
up make sure you don't push the other
bolts<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.450> well<00:02:46.659> so<00:02:47.349> that's<00:02:47.530> why<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.769> kind

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
bolts in as well so that's why it's kind

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.849 
bolts in as well so that's why it's kind
of<00:02:47.950> easily<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.370> one<00:02:48.579> side<00:02:48.790> at<00:02:48.849> a<00:02:48.970> time<00:02:52.859> the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
of easily do one side at a time the

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.110 
of easily do one side at a time the
hitch<00:02:54.010> doesn't<00:02:54.310> go<00:02:54.370> all<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.669> way<00:02:54.700> all<00:02:54.970> that

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
hitch doesn't go all the way all that

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.580 
hitch doesn't go all the way all that
far<00:02:55.299> past<00:02:55.629> the<00:02:55.840> exhaust<00:02:56.139> so<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.379> wanna<00:02:56.500> keep

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
far past the exhaust so you wanna keep

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.920 
far past the exhaust so you wanna keep
that<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:56.859> mind<00:02:57.069> as<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.340> hold<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.639> up<00:02:57.810> work<00:02:58.810> it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
that in mind as you hold it up work it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.009 
that in mind as you hold it up work it
in<00:02:59.049> place<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:03.329> pinch<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.510> bolts<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.870> one

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
in place you can pinch the bolts to one

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.640 
in place you can pinch the bolts to one
side<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.439> help<00:03:05.620> hold<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:05.980> place<00:03:07.439> and<00:03:08.439> so<00:03:08.560> you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
side to help hold it in place and so you

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.000 
side to help hold it in place and so you
can<00:03:08.739> install<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:09.099> nut<00:03:10.680> whichever<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:11.829> works

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
can install the nut whichever way works

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.589 
can install the nut whichever way works

we'll go ahead and torque them down as

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.790 
we'll go ahead and torque them down as
described<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.360> instructions<00:03:55.560> now<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.590> know

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
described in the instructions now I know

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.990 
described in the instructions now I know
this<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.100> quite<00:03:57.310> an<00:03:57.430> angle<00:03:57.790> with<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
this is a quite an angle with the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.760 
this is a quite an angle with the
exhausting<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.600> way<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:59.319> we're<00:03:59.500> using<00:03:59.650> a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
exhausting the way so we're using a

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.800 
exhausting the way so we're using a
wobble<00:04:00.130> extension<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:01.030> get<00:04:01.180> up<00:04:01.300> there<00:04:01.510> you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
wobble extension to get up there you

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.660 
wobble extension to get up there you
could<00:04:01.930> also<00:04:02.080> probably<00:04:02.350> get<00:04:02.860> away<00:04:03.040> by<00:04:03.250> using<00:04:03.489> a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
could also probably get away by using a
