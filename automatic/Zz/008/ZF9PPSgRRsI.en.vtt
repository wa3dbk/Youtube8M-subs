00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.210 

well<00:00:00.510> my<00:00:00.780> apple<00:00:01.110> tree<00:00:01.319> did<00:00:01.560> have<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.800> little<00:00:02.010> bit

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
well my apple tree did have a little bit

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.430 
well my apple tree did have a little bit
of<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.399> dew<00:00:02.610> drop

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.440 
of a dew drop

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.110 
of a dew drop
since<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:04.650> didn't<00:00:04.980> wasn't<00:00:05.310> loaded<00:00:05.910> with

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
since it didn't wasn't loaded with

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.600 
since it didn't wasn't loaded with
apples<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.779> I'd<00:00:07.319> taken<00:00:07.680> off<00:00:07.830> all<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.069> small

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
apples and I'd taken off all the small

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.549 
apples and I'd taken off all the small
ones<00:00:08.639> so<00:00:09.300> most<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.780> them<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.050> could<00:00:10.320> reach

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
ones so most of them that I could reach

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.390 
ones so most of them that I could reach
I<00:00:11.900> didn't<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> severe<00:00:13.500> June<00:00:13.830> drop<00:00:14.160> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
I didn't have a severe June drop and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.849 
I didn't have a severe June drop and
they<00:00:15.330> probably<00:00:15.599> got<00:00:15.750> pollinated<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.650> ones

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
they probably got pollinated the ones

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.980 
they probably got pollinated the ones
that<00:00:17.010> are<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.250> here<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.730> lot<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.630> them<00:00:18.720> didn't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
that are on here a lot of them didn't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
that are on here a lot of them didn't
get<00:00:19.109> pollinated<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.730> see<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> can

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
get pollinated and see that when you can

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.140 
get pollinated and see that when you can
tell<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> fall<00:00:25.230> off<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.470> its<00:00:25.830> own

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
tell it's going to fall off on its own

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.359 
tell it's going to fall off on its own
this<00:00:27.150> tree<00:00:27.449> could<00:00:27.630> maybe<00:00:27.840> stand<00:00:28.199> three<00:00:28.650> needs

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
this tree could maybe stand three needs

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
this tree could maybe stand three needs
to<00:00:29.519> back<00:00:29.730> down<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.750> how<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.080> stems<00:00:31.439> turned

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
to back down see how that stems turned

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.069 
to back down see how that stems turned
they're<00:00:32.640> gonna<00:00:32.759> fall<00:00:33.030> off<00:00:33.300> anyway<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
they're gonna fall off anyway so you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
they're gonna fall off anyway so you
might<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.320> well<00:00:34.410> pop<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.890> off<00:00:35.010> they're<00:00:35.550> not

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
might as well pop them off they're not

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
might as well pop them off they're not
growing<00:00:35.969> anymore<00:00:36.300> much<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> stem<00:00:36.989> turns<00:00:39.950> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
growing anymore much the stem turns it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.910 
growing anymore much the stem turns it
looks<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.760> horrible<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.480> do

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
looks like it's a horrible thing to do

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.790 
looks like it's a horrible thing to do
but<00:00:44.329> that<00:00:45.329> little<00:00:45.600> place<00:00:45.870> can't<00:00:46.170> stand<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
but that little place can't stand but so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
but that little place can't stand but so
many<00:00:47.039> apples<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:50.030> these<00:00:51.030> hours<00:00:51.420> misshaped

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
many apples on it these hours misshaped

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.229 
many apples on it these hours misshaped
and<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.730> you're<00:00:53.850> gonna<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and that one in you're gonna want to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
and that one in you're gonna want to
come<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.530> ones<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.370> stems

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
come off like the ones that the stems

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
come off like the ones that the stems
turn<00:00:56.940> color<00:00:57.320> that<00:00:58.320> ones<00:00:58.559> miss<00:00:58.770> Shay<00:00:59.010> to<00:01:00.530> see

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
turn color that ones miss Shay to see

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.799 
turn color that ones miss Shay to see
that<00:01:01.739> stem<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.969> stems<00:01:03.239> real<00:01:03.449> hard<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that stem see that stems real hard and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.469 
that stem see that stems real hard and
green<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> stay<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.519> I'll

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
green it's going to stay on there I'll

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
green it's going to stay on there I'll
probably<00:01:06.659> leave<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
probably leave that one on because the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.740 
probably leave that one on because the
apple<00:01:08.850> tree<00:01:09.000> doesn't<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.630> many

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
apple tree doesn't have but so many

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
apple tree doesn't have but so many
apples<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> stem<00:01:11.159> turns<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.610> call

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
apples but when the stem turns that call

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980 
apples but when the stem turns that call
it's<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.119> fall<00:01:12.299> off<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.720> might<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.930> well

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it's gonna fall off so might as well

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's gonna fall off so might as well
just<00:01:13.229> prop<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.250> how<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.760> didn't

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
just prop it all see how that one didn't

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
just prop it all see how that one didn't
develop<00:01:17.210> see<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.540> already<00:01:18.780> red<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.470> it's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
develop see that was already red so it's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
develop see that was already red so it's
not<00:01:20.070> gonna<00:01:20.340> grow<00:01:24.170> here's<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.409> under<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:27.380> see

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
not gonna grow here's one under here see

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
not gonna grow here's one under here see
they're<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.640> haven't<00:01:30.060> gotten<00:01:30.240> to
