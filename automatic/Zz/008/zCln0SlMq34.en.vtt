so<00:00:28.140> yeah<00:00:28.260> today<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.590> am<00:00:28.830> using<00:00:29.010> my<00:00:29.279> new<00:00:29.539> Toshiba

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
so yeah today I am using my new Toshiba

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.150 
so yeah today I am using my new Toshiba
you<00:00:31.050> know<00:00:31.170> camera<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> tripod

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you know camera I got it on the tripod

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.010 
you know camera I got it on the tripod
there<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.940> guys<00:00:33.059> could<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.420> me

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
there we go you guys could see me

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.819 
there we go you guys could see me
yeah

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
yeah

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.170 
yeah
um<00:00:35.280> yeah<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.670> using<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> Toshiba<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.350> uh

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
um yeah I'm using the Toshiba one and uh

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
um yeah I'm using the Toshiba one and uh
you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> figured<00:00:40.140> um<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.829> know

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
you know I kind of figured um you know

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
you know I kind of figured um you know
it's<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.250> camera<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.579> uses<00:00:41.700> memory<00:00:42.059> cards<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
it's a camera that uses memory cards I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.880 
it's a camera that uses memory cards I
kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> figured<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> wouldn't<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.710> any

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
kind of figured it wouldn't have any

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160 
kind of figured it wouldn't have any
internal<00:00:44.160> memory<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.840> basically<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.050> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
internal memory and basically the way it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.040 
internal memory and basically the way it
went<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> 45<00:00:48.030> megabytes<00:00:48.510> internal

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
went it has like 45 megabytes internal

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
went it has like 45 megabytes internal
memory<00:00:49.320> which<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.460> mean<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.449> record

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
memory which is I mean you can record

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
memory which is I mean you can record
like<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> 30<00:00:52.500> second<00:00:52.920> video<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
like a 30 second video pretty much I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.610 
like a 30 second video pretty much I
think<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:54.750> mainly<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.170> put<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.440> there

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
think they mainly just put it on there

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.119 
think they mainly just put it on there
for<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.890> settings<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> yeah

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
for like settings and but so yeah

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.380 
for like settings and but so yeah
I'm<00:00:59.219> using<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> new<00:00:59.640> camera<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> quality

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
I'm using that new camera the quality

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.020 
I'm using that new camera the quality
should<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.899> better<00:01:01.020> hopefully<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
should be a little better hopefully I

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
should be a little better hopefully I
mean<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.149> notice<00:01:03.449> took<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.660> last<00:01:03.809> unboxing<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
mean I notice took my last unboxing I

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.960 
mean I notice took my last unboxing I
was<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:04.920> quiet<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.489> I'm<00:01:05.549> trying<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
was a little bit quiet so I'm trying to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.450 
was a little bit quiet so I'm trying to
talk<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.750> louder<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.320> hopefully<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
talk a little louder so hopefully that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.050 
talk a little louder so hopefully that
turns<00:01:08.670> out<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.659> well<00:01:10.220> but<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
turns out pretty well but it's like I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
turns out pretty well but it's like I
remember<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.360> card<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
remember a card for it and I got a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
remember a card for it and I got a
pretty<00:01:14.400> good<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.630> many

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
pretty good one I got that you so many

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.700 
pretty good one I got that you so many
32-gigabyte

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
32-gigabyte

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.060 
32-gigabyte
and<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.930> says<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and I don't know if it says it and it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
and I don't know if it says it and it
says<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> memory<00:01:20.729> card<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> class<00:01:21.869> 10

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
says on the memory card it's a class 10

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
says on the memory card it's a class 10
which<00:01:23.100> means<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> pretty<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.060> day<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
which means it's a pretty good day to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.870 
which means it's a pretty good day to
speed<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> 40<00:01:25.650> megabits<00:01:26.130> per<00:01:26.250> second<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
speed it's a 40 megabits per second I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.080 
speed it's a 40 megabits per second I
guess<00:01:27.659> 40<00:01:28.110> actually<00:01:28.799> has<00:01:28.890> 40<00:01:29.189> megabytes<00:01:29.909> per

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
guess 40 actually has 40 megabytes per

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.780 
guess 40 actually has 40 megabytes per
second<00:01:30.509> which<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:30.810> good<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> yeah<00:01:32.640> it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
second which is pretty good so yeah it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
second which is pretty good so yeah it's
pretty<00:01:32.850> cool<00:01:33.119> high<00:01:33.450> speed<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.650> got<00:01:34.799> 32

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
pretty cool high speed and I got 32

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850 
pretty cool high speed and I got 32
gigabytes<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.909> seems<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.710> probably<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
gigabytes it seems like probably the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
gigabytes it seems like probably the
most<00:01:38.070> cost-effective<00:01:38.820> memory<00:01:39.360> size<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.960> can

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
most cost-effective memory size you can

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.740 
most cost-effective memory size you can
get<00:01:40.170> about<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.770> mean<00:01:41.430> 64<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.630> isn't

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
get about now I mean 64 really isn't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.800 
get about now I mean 64 really isn't
worth<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> 16<00:01:44.130> gigabyte<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.270> basically

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
worth it and 16 gigabyte it's basically

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
worth it and 16 gigabyte it's basically
the<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.200> price<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.710> 32<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.490> might<00:01:47.640> as

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the same price as 32 so you might as

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
the same price as 32 so you might as
well<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.020> went<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.320> Sony

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
well go with this and I went with Sony

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
well go with this and I went with Sony
and<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> guys<00:01:50.100> notice<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:51.149> went<00:01:51.899> with

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and if you guys notice that I went with

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.800 
and if you guys notice that I went with
that<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.790> well<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.030> saw<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> bunch

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that because well you know I saw a bunch

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.819 
that because well you know I saw a bunch
of<00:01:54.930> sand<00:01:55.200> disc<00:01:55.439> ones<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.640> same<00:01:56.850> disc<00:01:57.090> ones

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
of sand disc ones and the same disc ones

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.260 
of sand disc ones and the same disc ones
were<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.520> expensive<00:01:59.729> than<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
were actually more expensive than the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200 
were actually more expensive than the
Sony<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.520> Sony<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
Sony and I think and I think Sony is

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.600 
Sony and I think and I think Sony is
probably<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.840> better<00:02:04.229> company<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.490> be

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
probably a better company and to be

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.719 
probably a better company and to be
honest<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.380> we'll<00:02:07.560> find<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.979> I'm

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
honest but you know we'll find out I'm

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.059 
honest but you know we'll find out I'm
so<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> full-size<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.069> you

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so it is just like a full-size one you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.760 
so it is just like a full-size one you
know<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.790> use<00:02:12.090> um<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.410> cameras

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
know like you can use um like on cameras

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.940 
know like you can use um like on cameras
you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
you
get<00:02:14.099> like<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> micro-st<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.209> then<00:02:15.330> use<00:02:15.450> that

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
get like a micro-st and then use that

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.940 
get like a micro-st and then use that
adapter<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> don't<00:02:16.470> feel<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.620> doing<00:02:16.920> that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
adapter but I don't feel like doing that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.949 
adapter but I don't feel like doing that
because<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:18.060> kind<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.300> stupid<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.690> do<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
because it's kind of stupid to do that

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.780 
because it's kind of stupid to do that
to<00:02:19.019> be<00:02:19.110> honest<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.950> yep

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
HD and 3d which is good because Isis in

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.570 
HD and 3d which is good because Isis in
a<00:02:48.630> chair<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> 3d<00:02:49.799> camera<00:02:50.099> although

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
a chair is this a 3d camera although

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.940 
a chair is this a 3d camera although
like<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.299> said<00:02:51.480> I'm<00:02:51.569> not<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:51.930> using<00:02:52.110> 3d<00:02:52.829> in

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
like I said I'm not really using 3d in

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.800 
like I said I'm not really using 3d in
the<00:02:53.040> unboxings<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.060> probably<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the unboxings because it's probably a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.940 
the unboxings because it's probably a
little<00:02:55.349> bit<00:02:55.560> useless<00:02:57.319> beyond<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.530> Oh<00:02:58.739> their

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
little bit useless beyond that Oh their

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.410 
little bit useless beyond that Oh their
record<00:02:59.280> time<00:03:00.860> 12<00:03:01.860> hours<00:03:02.010> which<00:03:02.340> HD<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.120> Full

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
record time 12 hours which HD and Full

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.539 
record time 12 hours which HD and Full
HD<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:04.079> two<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.470> half<00:03:04.590> hours<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.160> that's

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
HD it's two and a half hours so that's

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.819 
HD it's two and a half hours so that's
cool<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.849> guess

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
cool I guess

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.780 
cool I guess
yeah<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.329> let's<00:03:09.450> open<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.750> up<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.610> see<00:03:11.610> what

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
yeah so let's open it up and see what

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.900 
yeah so let's open it up and see what
it's<00:03:11.940> like<00:03:14.959> okay<00:03:16.670> there<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:18.209> go<00:03:18.239> hopefully

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
it's like okay there we go hopefully

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.000 
it's like okay there we go hopefully
there<00:03:20.910> we<00:03:21.000> go<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.530> looks<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:25.769> is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
there we go and it looks like that is

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.420 
there we go and it looks like that is
all<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.739> sometimes<00:03:28.950> they<00:03:29.250> put

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
all it's in and I sometimes they put

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.710 
all it's in and I sometimes they put
instructions<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.090> we're<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.420> immune<00:03:30.630> you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
instructions but we're in the immune you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.550 
instructions but we're in the immune you
don't<00:03:30.870> need<00:03:30.989> instructions

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
don't need instructions

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.229 
don't need instructions
there<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.310> go<00:03:32.459> that's<00:03:32.670> pretty<00:03:32.850> much<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.209> we

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
there we go that's pretty much all we

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.599 
there we go that's pretty much all we
hit<00:03:33.510> that's<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.930> have<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.230> do<00:03:34.430> yes<00:03:35.430> I'm

used<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.290> scan<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.799> camera<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.450> yeah<00:03:39.690> Sony

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
used to scan this camera so yeah Sony

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.160 
used to scan this camera so yeah Sony
SDHC<00:03:41.519> which<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.420> think<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.720> stands<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:42.959> high

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
SDHC which is I think it stands for high

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.590 
SDHC which is I think it stands for high
capacity<00:03:43.769> there's<00:03:44.370> also<00:03:44.579> XC<00:03:45.180> which<00:03:45.389> is

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
capacity there's also XC which is

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.960 
capacity there's also XC which is
extreme<00:03:45.989> capacity<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:46.859> i<00:03:47.250> don't<00:03:47.609> need<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.819> i

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
extreme capacity but i don't need that i

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.220 
extreme capacity but i don't need that i
don't<00:03:48.239> think<00:03:48.389> by<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.380> way<00:03:50.780> goose<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.989> chewing

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
don't think by the way goose is chewing

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.780 
don't think by the way goose is chewing
on<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.470> box<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.069> this<00:03:53.190> might<00:03:53.430> as<00:03:53.519> well<00:03:53.639> point

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
on the box and this might as well point
