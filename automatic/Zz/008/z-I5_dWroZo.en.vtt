00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.029
 hello and welcome to this series of 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.160
 tutorials about datamining with 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.059
 statistics today has in this 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.620
 14th session 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.730
 we will address the issue of 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 construction of trees 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.190
 classification with the child algorithm 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.840
 we will continue with the data 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 credit 'what nothing we have 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.980
 cleaned up and prepare for the discomfort 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.509
 during the previous session we 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.460
 had used statistica for 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.910
 build a classification tree of 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.910
 card type 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.810
 during this session we will 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.760
 talk about the method shade the options 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.530
 of analysis of the chase algorithm 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.220
 exhaustive and we'll see an example 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.220
 in statistics 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.830
 said is the acronym of who shook 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.330
 automatic sinkiewicz detector this 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.370
 tool helps to build trees from 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.860
 non- binary decision unlike the 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.870
 methodology maps in the tree 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.870
 represented by the first is divided 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.160
 in 3 our children this algorithm and well 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.900
 suitable for large analysis 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.340
 volumetrics of data and it is often 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.450
 used in marketing for 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.450
 segmentation issues 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.890
 both shalit map algorithms 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.320
 allow or two to code the model 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.759
 as a nova and so as in a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.729
 at nova you can include terms 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.049
 interaction through cards allow 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.329
 also to specify elbows 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.500
 ranking errors in the shahid the 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.030
 elbow classification errors affect 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.319
 not directly the process of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.850
 construction of the tree but at 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.009
 contrary the estimate of the risk in 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.619
 output which is actually a measure of 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.840
 the misclassification you can 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.369
 use cross validation either by v 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.079
 together either using 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.060
 learning and testing samples 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.399
 to avoid the over adjustments of both 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.200
 names as to the fit of pumps 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.340
 will we do it allows to control the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 error rate of first species 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.530
 in child the shutdown settings are 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.820
 significantly different compared to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 those proposed in map 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.660
 the minimum number of observations allows 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.350
 to determine the we who are still 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.870
 visible 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.270
 helena terminals in this case a 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.050
 containing no more than 60 observations 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.000
 still be divided the maximum number of 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.720
 does not control the complexity of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.580
 the the probability for division 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800
 determines if a division can be 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.600
 considered statistically 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.220
 significant the division process 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.970
 continues until there is no 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.100
 no more significant division and the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.450
 probability for melting dull 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.190
 years we can merge the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.989
 categories of predictor variables 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.450
 if there is no difference 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.160
 significant credit risk between 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.610
 these categories at the threshold of 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.170
 specified significance the algorithm of 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.730
 shine will examine all of 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.500
 variables and then determine the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.500
 categorical can be merged 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.400
 the exhaustive child algorithm implies 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.200
 more calculation than the algorithm 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.250
 classic and will require 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 resources and computing times 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.150
 much more important on large 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.769
 volumetrics including with many 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.750
 predictive variables and many 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.709
 arrangements 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.359
 however, this option allows you to test 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.989
 the divisions a lot more way 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.760
 complete 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.099
 actually this algorithm will select 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.140
 the best division variable after 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.299
 have grouped the categories until 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.859
 that there are only two left 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.480
 process of selecting the best 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.220
 division variable makes it possible to obtain 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.400
 trees that are often more 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.989
 performing in statistics to you 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.049
 find the models chase whose menu 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.519
 datamining 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.819
 we have the choice between the model 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.280
 standard is the coded model I'm going 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.900
 select here the model coded on 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.519
 coded template use the parameters 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.139
 as in a nova and allows 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:03.319
 to introduce interaction terms 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:05.000
 in the model the independent variable 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.919
 being categorical we have to checked 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.690
 this option before selecting the 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:13.040
 variables in the previous session 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.639
 we had to save the variables 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.229
 important subgroup of the form 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.829
 simplifies the selection here 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.829
 variables 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.790
 the default nova template is a plan 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.920
 full factorial of all 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.330
 categorical variables so we have 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.770
 three or four interactions 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.570
 levels or more 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.950
 sometimes the terms 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.110
 of high order interactions under is 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.940
 interesting to study the generally 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.530
 we do not take into account in this 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.270
 example I will only remember the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.910
 two-level interactions and 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.620
 main effects so i will use 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.830
 custom effects for the model 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.170
 inter selected all the factors 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.590
 categorical and used a model 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.300
 factorial 2 Â° 2 and I will also 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:08.670
 selected all of my 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:09.690
 continuous variable to apply the 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.760
 elbows misclassification 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.450
 I must first select the codes 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.520
 answers I select them all and 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.810
 in the classification tab I'm going 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.150
 define elbows misclassifications 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.740
 custom as in the example map 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.570
 the value 2 means that it is more 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.070
 expensive to be wrong in predicting one of 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.810
 this close as being a good record 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.810
 when in reality it is bad 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:40.080
 I accept the stopping conditions by 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.630
 default I select the shade algorithm 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.650
 exhaustive and I can now 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.650
 build trees 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:54.080
 the tree diagram represent the 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.080
 divisions and nodes of the tree 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.120
 and to explore this tree more in 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.539
 detail we can use the tree 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.539
 pop 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.529
 and clicking on tree structures 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:22.800
 you find all the criteria of 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:24.059
 division for all of the nodes in 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.089
 the observations tab you can 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:28.889
 click on curve of lift the curve 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:30.899
 represents the gain you can 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.399
 to wait for you using the model of 

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:37.770
 respective forecasts rather than 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:39.599
 simple reference information in 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.099
 the tab classification you can 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:46.050
 click on planned value to those 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:48.529
 observed by class and you get 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.800
 including the classification matrix 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:55.800
 of both is ready from the model on 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.179
 note that there are 84 good 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.939
 records that have been predicted bad and 

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:05.339
 we can also see this 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:08.639
 representation of this information under 

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:09.719
 histogram shape by varied and 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.580
 also in a matrix of 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:14.539
 classification with the profiles the nests 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.539
 and columns 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.650
 at the next session 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.170
 we will continue building the 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.000
 classification trees using the 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.860
 boosting decision trees and the 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.510
 random forests then we'll see 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:37.530
 how to compare the performance of 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:39.180
 models for more information on 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.400
