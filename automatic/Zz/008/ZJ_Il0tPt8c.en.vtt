on me because of so much volume and also
because<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> type<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> exercise<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.739> I'm

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
because of the type of exercise that I'm

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
because of the type of exercise that I'm
doing<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.540> figure<00:00:43.079> something

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
doing so I'm gonna I figure something

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
doing so I'm gonna I figure something
out<00:00:43.350> here<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.950> pretty<00:00:44.070> cool<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
out here that's pretty cool I'm going to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
out here that's pretty cool I'm going to
do<00:00:45.390> an<00:00:45.510> exercise<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:47.010> between<00:00:47.160> six<00:00:47.820> now

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
do an exercise and in between six now

not all of you be able to do it but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.990 
not all of you be able to do it but
they're<00:00:49.770> variations<00:00:50.370> over<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.850> use

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
they're variations over that you can use

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.450 
they're variations over that you can use
in<00:00:51.270> between<00:00:51.870> sets<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> stretch<00:00:53.430> my

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
in between sets I'm going to stretch my

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.630 
in between sets I'm going to stretch my
ex<00:00:53.850> respiratory<00:00:54.390> muscles<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.129> deep<00:00:56.129> breathe

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
ex respiratory muscles and deep breathe

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
ex respiratory muscles and deep breathe
deeply<00:00:57.270> deeply<00:00:57.870> excuse<00:00:58.320> me<00:00:58.500> jacked<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.460> right

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
deeply deeply excuse me jacked up right

now

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
now

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.260 
now
breathe<00:01:00.690> deeply<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> number<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
breathe deeply it will do a number of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.870 
breathe deeply it will do a number of
things<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.470> reduce<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
things the one it's going to reduce the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.660 
things the one it's going to reduce the
onset<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:07.010> muscular<00:01:08.010> development<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
onset of muscular development of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.690 
onset of muscular development of
muscular<00:01:09.979> neurotically<00:01:10.979> patterns<00:01:11.490> or

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
muscular neurotically patterns or

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.850 
muscular neurotically patterns or
muscles<00:01:12.060> muscle<00:01:12.540> tightness<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.260> reduces<00:01:13.740> my

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
muscles muscle tightness that reduces my

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609 
muscles muscle tightness that reduces my
breathing<00:01:14.189> capacity<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.479> also<00:01:15.750> going

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
breathing capacity but it's also going

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.230 
breathing capacity but it's also going
to<00:01:16.740> increase<00:01:16.979> my<00:01:17.189> energy<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.640> between<00:01:17.939> sets

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to increase my energy in between sets

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.230 
to increase my energy in between sets
and<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.439> been<00:01:19.560> practicing<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.240> using

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and as I've been practicing this using

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
and as I've been practicing this using
the<00:01:21.330> breathing<00:01:21.659> /<00:01:22.200> bioenergetics<00:01:22.830> tool<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the breathing / bioenergetics tool in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.640 
the breathing / bioenergetics tool in
three<00:01:23.310> sets<00:01:23.549> each<00:01:24.330> set<00:01:24.780> I'm<00:01:24.960> getting<00:01:25.259> stronger

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
three sets each set I'm getting stronger

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
three sets each set I'm getting stronger
and<00:01:25.920> feel<00:01:26.189> better<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:26.729> I've<00:01:27.210> nourishing
