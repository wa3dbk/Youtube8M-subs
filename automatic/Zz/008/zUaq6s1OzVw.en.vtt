00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.650
 end 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.250
 He is very interesting, I think. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.439
 is a little better even than this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.799
 browser that comes with it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.710
 I liked it, it's sailing people. 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.259
 Are you going to play up there? 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.380
 giving a blink so in the images 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.630
 It was something that I did not like and that for me. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.880
 Bother a little, I like everything. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.470
 static everything right to do 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 both up and down 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:56.210
 down but we will test it here google 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:02:00.180
 and facebook instead of bruno in the goal 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.570
 carries very fast he the fight is for 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.740
 bi flaps manezinho the system will here 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.850
 to serve is to treat the hour and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
 increasing the flaps 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.240
 even more practical and if the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.040
 another actually is that you try to close 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.210
 the coupon opens another 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.030
 we have a very good deal here 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 interesting the staff let's see if 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.000
 A mouse here happens when the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.420
 people put the mouse 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.300
 come on he has one he is now a type 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.490
 of a skin tank that is the one that has 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.170
 one of the notebooks and it puts a 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:46.580
 Moldy little girl looking alone 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:49.640
 interesting รณ รณ รณ you give the touch is 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:58.100
 as if you clicked there is very 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:02.980
 so look there, the other side we have 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.720
 here the personal keyboard looks at the keyboard 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.140
 I do not want the keyboard anymore 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.820
 I think there is one owner here and now 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:24.830
 people will enter for example the address 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:27.970
 here www.an.com.br make a test of 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.970
 earth site 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:36.470
 we find it cool when you click it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.130
 a circle indicates where 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.150
 made the touch 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.850
 come on I think for the wheel person 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.980
 flash quicktime and arrow 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.780
 flash advertisement has this bar what 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.350
 that I did not like 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.770
 a bar on the site itself that is 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.910
 accompanying these winks that give here 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.530
 O 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.530
 that's what bothers me 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.250
 but overall it turned off by pulling 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.269
 here's an excuse for the word fills the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:32.010
 bag 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:39.539
 Let 's open a new tab here I want 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:49.680
 enter now that the address already has here 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:51.510
 optimize what is what is 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.820
 happening on the site of the earth is doing 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:08.539
 noise 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:08.539
 the globe is the god propaganda page 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.940
 ready went 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:21.060
 Let's go to the globe website. 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:23.920
 here it seems that they are hawking here, right? 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:30.250
 that he too seems not to 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:33.360
 loads after it will load too 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.070
 It seems very nice, too. 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:45.760
 For example, let's click here on the 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:50.730
 Mauro moves the mouse over 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.730
 He already recognizes just arriving and clicking. 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.210
 very cool, I liked it, damn it 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.080
 this resource has the mouse 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.110
 very interesting let's close 2011 that 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.190
 happens at the mall 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:17.440
 There he goes, I do not think he's going alone. 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:19.900
 even a little under the water close 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.090
 there it opens again here we 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:31.510
 we have a site that we have already visited 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:35.440
 personal favorites 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:39.250
 this was a tip and two users who 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.650
 asked to see the end is a is a 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:53.610

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.850
 just type there 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.130
 finally it comes one of the first 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.820
 clicking and downloading and installing is very 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.610
 Quiet the staff if you liked the one 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.220
