00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.339
 preserves 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.679
 the most important advance in history in the preservation of food there 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 aluminum cans for beer or tin cans for peas 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 so you can eat or drink probably come the cta 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.419
 the fire from the top 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.769
 or cut side 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.449
 the technology to open the cans has changed in a surprising way with the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.510
 over the years in the first case the self-heating can uses chemical 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 to warm up the content but well inside there are active tower a bit of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520
 meat and a little water 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.780
 chad to derive it the consumer presses a button on the base that breaks the seal 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 yes no and I plan the ua with the load is initiating the reaction to tel 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.560
 According to measures that are mixed without the consumer should be pulling the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.200
 can slowly to facilitate the process 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.970
 in three minutes the drink will be between 21 and 26 degrees warmer up 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.960
 reach 65 degrees if you consider the perfect temperature for a cup of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.560
 coffee 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.920
 that yes the authoritarian container that ordered a different principle 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.090
 the tin takes advantage of the heat and evaporation to cool the drink 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 the end consumer of the reservoir to release a drying substance 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.780
 that absorbs water 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.619
 a double inner layer is filled with water and when the drying one is mixed 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.189
 with them the water evaporates transformation that requires heat 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.620
 the heat comes from the drink and is absorbed by contained salts 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
 in the bottom of the can 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.830
 Soboce your bag a drink at room temperature 22 or 23 degrees 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.970
 centigrade in three or four minutes cool and up to four degrees because 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630
 is the one that would reach in a refrigerator 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.560
 the manufacturing process of a can begins with tin plates that is 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.180
 make or covered in tin 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.299
 the metal is also coated with a protective coating of varnish 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.530
 efe 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.539
 it puts moderates when discovering the combats the outside of the lamp for 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.350
 protect it from training 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.419
 the hardness of the varnish varies depending on the acidity of the packaged food 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.189
 I 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.919
 3 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.509
 a can of peas does not need too much because they are not very acidic 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.899
 but one of tomato sauce needs a thick layer 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.439
 the machine makes a flange to the centers that receives the name of the bird 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.419
 the afa this allows to create the seat to fix the focus of the can jicha 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.419
 shock 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.559
 the same machine makes the ribs or laces 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.559
 the accordion shape allows its expansion at high temperatures 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.309
 gallen total suggestions to apra the necessary resistance for vacuum 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.059
 by this year's black belt the rims funds allow the 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.059
 resistance to the cooking process show severe pressure 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.499
 This factory produces 3 million cans a day 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 approximately one billion a year 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.489
 for centuries the basic principle of the preserved remained unchanged 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.079
 the food is sealed airtight containers and subjected to temperatures that oscillate 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.529
 between 115 and 120 degrees Celsius to destroy any microorganism 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.949
 contaminant that could contain 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.879
 from putting the beans in the cans and making sure that all 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.539
 full 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.589
 foundation then we went to the addition of the brine of coverages 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.009
 brine is hot water with a slight health solution that 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.689
 here by adding life we ​​expel any air that could 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.879
 have in the cans 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.099
 the salt is added to flavor 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.529
 once the lid has been placed the can becomes a container 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.339
 tight the cans are brought to a giant pressure cooker 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:08.199
 the food is cooked inside the cans and not before because this method creates the 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.199
 more sterile medium 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.459
 once the can has been sealed, no bacteria can form in the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.959
 food 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.609
 but either hard thunder or ham the canning process basically the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.559
 same 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.689
 the food is put in airtight containers and then cooked 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.139
 however, all preserves have no problem with microwaves 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.270
 own afternoon 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.949
 there is indeed a widespread error that can not be used 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.460
 metal in the microwave and tenacity is not true as long as the can is 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.250
 properly designed of that figure for example is a traditional one that does not 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.550
 could get in a microwave 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.430
 the power core dean 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.699
 if we did 0 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:55.039
 its surface would retract the microwaves when not preventing them from reaching their 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.919
 content 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.800
 the text adds that if the can has the right design it is like this one that has 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.060
 very shallow and a large mouth through which microwaves can be absorbed 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.409
 Note the food can heat up perfectly 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.779
 but I'll tell you in May rubén 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.489
 its detention the consumer just has to remove the cap that smoke 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.609
 put the tin in the microwave and understand it 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.389
 microwave cans are the newest in a long list of innovations 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.979
 developed by puskas manufacturas 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.789
 the cans were airtight 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.429
 and thanks to them there was fresh food always available anywhere 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.870
 the new invention changed the way of eating in the world 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.889
 julien producing the food in a alaza sealing it and heating the acual the 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.280
 It was possible to send high quality food with all its nutrients to 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.940
 Any part of the world 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.000
 police the British navy used more than 18 thousand kilograms of food 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.369
 canned to the year 1813 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.739
 since it helped to prevent the group and other diseases as due to the 

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:03.529
 lack of vitamins and nutrients suffered by the sailors in which they passed 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.860
 long seasons sailing 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.280
 Modern canning has minimized the possibility of contracting 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.320
 botulism caused by bacteria growing in anaerobic environments 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.530
 between 1990 and 2000 there was no reported case of botulism caused by 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.699
 One preserved in the United States 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.960
 the first aluminum beverage can was manufactured in 1963, if it is 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.470
 one of the latest packaging innovations is called cans cans here 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.469
 It is made of aluminum but shaped like a bottle 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.559
 another can that has already been reformed is the spray 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:44.100
 patented in 1926 by eric brown jaén juri Norwegian chemical genre 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.510
 the aerosol went on the market during the Second World War when the 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.810
 The US military was looking for an effective way to get rid of the 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.479
 insects in the jungle 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.419
 the aerosol cans works by means of a troop entities that is a gas under pressure 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.949
 the nozzle on the top of the long one opens when pressing 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.680
 the pressure of the gas drives the product, forcing it out 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.680
 by a narrow tube 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.169
 the nozzle atomizes the liquid vaporize idle 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:21.499
 the first aerosol cans used chlorofluorocarbons 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:27.609
 the fcc proponents were removed from more than 90% of the aerosols of 

00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:30.119
 united states in 1978 

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:33.840
 replaced by others coming as he wanted to cut it 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.379
 and the resigned ether 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.469
 this has contributed to the regeneration of the ozone layer 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.339
 but you have to be careful when throwing the 

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:45.339
 if thrown into the fire they may explode 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.910
 One of the latest technologies developed are the flange covers 

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:55.449
 Aluminum four are flexible and goal-oriented so they continue to protect 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:00.360
 content of lust oxygen just like conventional jeans cans 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.949
 thorne the difference is that you can open with half that port that the 

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.139
 traditional 

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:09.840
 joan thanks to that angle being able to save 10% of metal at the edge of the 

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.280
 prócer bernardo slept shahzad saving 25 thousand tons of aluminum
