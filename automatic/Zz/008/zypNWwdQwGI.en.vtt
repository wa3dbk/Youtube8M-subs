to your full automatic mode reason why

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
to your full automatic mode reason why
it's<00:00:19.710> because<00:00:19.920> there's<00:00:20.070> three<00:00:20.340> things<00:00:20.640> going

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
it's because there's three things going

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
it's because there's three things going
on<00:00:21.119> when<00:00:21.359> there's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.720> picture<00:00:22.170> being<00:00:22.380> taken

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
to have stronger exposures you're going

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.360 
to have stronger exposures you're going
to<00:00:42.750> always<00:00:42.870> make<00:00:43.170> sure<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.800> images<00:00:44.160> are

just look through your viewfinder and on

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.090 
just look through your viewfinder and on
my<00:01:28.140> camera<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.680> look<00:01:28.890> through<00:01:28.920> my

speed that the camera is selecting

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
speed that the camera is selecting
that's<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.340> important<00:01:38.759> thing<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:40.350> look<00:01:40.500> at

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that's an important thing to look at

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
that's an important thing to look at
because<00:01:40.950> even<00:01:41.490> though<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.729> camera<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.360> in

because even though the camera is in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
because even though the camera is in
charge<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.079> shutter<00:01:43.409> speed<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
charge of my shutter speed all I have to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.080 
charge of my shutter speed all I have to
do<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.899> sure<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.110> fast<00:01:46.439> enough<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.759> as

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
do is make sure it's fast enough so as

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
do is make sure it's fast enough so as
I'm<00:01:48.750> pointing<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:49.079> camera<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.740> bright

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I'm pointing my camera in bright

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
I'm pointing my camera in bright
situations<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:51.060> noticing<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:52.020> shutter

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
situations I'm noticing that my shutter

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.630 
situations I'm noticing that my shutter
speed<00:01:53.240> fluctuates<00:01:54.240> from<00:01:54.380> 1-800<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.189> second

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
speed fluctuates from 1-800 of a second

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
speed fluctuates from 1-800 of a second
to<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.479> cases<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:59.000> 250th<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.270> second<00:02:00.770> but

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to some cases one 250th of a second but

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.420 
to some cases one 250th of a second but
now<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> take<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> picture<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.439> an<00:02:05.040> area

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
now if I go to take a picture of an area

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.080 
now if I go to take a picture of an area
in<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.530> little<00:02:07.530> gazebo<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
in this little gazebo right here and I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
in this little gazebo right here and I
notice<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.649> my<00:02:10.649> show<00:02:10.860> speed<00:02:11.160> isn't<00:02:11.340> fast

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
notice that my show speed isn't fast

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.500 
notice that my show speed isn't fast
enough

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
enough

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.690 
enough
right<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.349> notice<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.010> show<00:02:14.250> speed<00:02:14.550> is

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
right now I notice that my show speed is

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000 
right now I notice that my show speed is
one<00:02:14.940> thirtieth<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.110> second<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:16.769> too

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
one thirtieth of a second that's too

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.960 
one thirtieth of a second that's too
slow<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:19.049> if<00:02:19.349> your<00:02:19.620> shutter<00:02:19.980> speed<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.610> too

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
slow so if your shutter speed is too

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.789 
slow so if your shutter speed is too
slow<00:02:21.409> just<00:02:22.409> raise<00:02:22.709> your<00:02:22.739> ISO<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:25.319> this<00:02:25.590> room

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
slow just raise your ISO so in this room

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.250 
slow just raise your ISO so in this room
here<00:02:26.129> or<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.909> gazebo<00:02:27.150> I'm<00:02:28.019> going<00:02:28.200> to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
here or in this gazebo I'm going to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.280 
here or in this gazebo I'm going to
raise<00:02:28.379> my<00:02:28.409> ISO<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:30.230> 200<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.450> now<00:02:33.720> gave<00:02:34.049> me

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
raise my ISO to 200 and that now gave me

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.740 
raise my ISO to 200 and that now gave me
a<00:02:34.319> fast<00:02:34.709> enough<00:02:34.920> shutter<00:02:35.220> speed<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.849> always

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
a fast enough shutter speed I always

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.970 
a fast enough shutter speed I always
want<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.019> sure<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:37.620> shutter<00:02:37.890> speed

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
want to make sure that my shutter speed

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.069 
want to make sure that my shutter speed
is<00:02:38.370> fast<00:02:38.400> enough<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.239> need<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.599> know<00:02:39.720> more

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
is fast enough if you need to know more

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.690 
is fast enough if you need to know more
about<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.680> your<00:02:40.829> shutter<00:02:41.069> speed<00:02:41.340> should<00:02:41.370> be

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
about what your shutter speed should be

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130 
about what your shutter speed should be

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
keep an eye on your shutter speed by

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
keep an eye on your shutter speed by

raising your ISO and by Lauren your Ida

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.309
