00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
our landings who did do a good job of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.610 
our landings who did do a good job of

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
hitting our positions in our hands

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.250 
hitting our positions in our hands
stands<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.610> end<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:06.390> all<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:07.230> control

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
stands in the end it all we can control

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260 
stands in the end it all we can control

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
girls did a pretty good job with it that

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.320 
girls did a pretty good job with it that
was<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> toughest<00:02:11.700> part<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> meat<00:02:12.150> i

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
was the toughest part of the meat i

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.960 
was the toughest part of the meat i
believe<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.920> starting<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.070> scratch<00:02:14.310> there's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
believe is starting from scratch there's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.280 
believe is starting from scratch there's
nobody<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.720> we're<00:02:18.870> supposed<00:02:19.200> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
nobody there and and we're supposed to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
nobody there and and we're supposed to
somehow<00:02:19.710> create<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.430> energy<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:20.940> get

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
somehow create this energy and get

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.790 
somehow create this energy and get
rolling<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:22.110> thought<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> girls<00:02:22.590> did<00:02:22.650> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
rolling and I thought the girls did a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.530 
rolling and I thought the girls did a
really<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.100> job<00:02:23.160> with<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.120> only<00:02:24.330> thing<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
really good job with the only thing I

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180 
really good job with the only thing I
really<00:02:24.840> remember<00:02:24.870> over<00:02:25.200> my<00:02:25.260> bar<00:02:25.470> set<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.860> that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
really remember over my bar set is that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.010 
really remember over my bar set is that
I<00:02:26.220> did<00:02:26.520> my<00:02:26.610> last<00:02:26.790> cast<00:02:27.060> Hanson<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.720> locked

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
I did my last cast Hanson and I locked

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.990 
I did my last cast Hanson and I locked
it<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.350> because<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:29.070> always<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.610> little

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
it out because I'm always just a little

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.460 
it out because I'm always just a little
bit<00:02:30.150> short<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.780> was<00:02:30.990> something<00:02:31.110> i<00:02:31.380> was

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
bit short so that was something i was

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.550 
bit short so that was something i was
working<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.270> whole<00:02:33.270> week<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.750> i<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.410> have

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
working on a whole week and i just have

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.910 
him do it and i lost it in try to be
patient<00:02:36.540> through<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.140> swing<00:02:37.350> into<00:02:37.710> my

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
patient through the swing into my

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.420 
patient through the swing into my
dismount<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.580> stuck<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:40.070> felt<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.280> could

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
dismount I stuck it I felt like I could

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.680 
dismount I stuck it I felt like I could
have<00:02:41.520> done<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:41.820> better<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.150> bars<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.540> feel

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
have done a lot better in bars I feel

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.790 
have done a lot better in bars I feel
like<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:42.930> were<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> few<00:02:43.200> casting<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.680> soon

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
like there were a few casting and soon

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.400 
like there were a few casting and soon
as<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.980> miss<00:02:44.220> um<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:45.660> kind<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.020> few<00:02:46.230> things

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
as I miss um just kind of a few things

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.020 
as I miss um just kind of a few things
here<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.709> there<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.250> did<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.610> bar<00:02:47.760> scene<00:02:47.940> have

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
here and there I did the bar scene have

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.670 
here and there I did the bar scene have
been<00:02:48.180> training<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.840> everyone<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.320> line<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
been training and everyone in line up to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:03.100 
been training and everyone in line up to
their<00:02:49.830> job

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.860 

again<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.230> thought<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.500> girls<00:03:04.790> started

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
again I thought the girls started

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.000 
again I thought the girls started
relatively<00:03:06.870> well<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.170> bars<00:03:07.379> and<00:03:07.680> then<00:03:07.829> we<00:03:07.920> went

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
relatively well on bars and then we went

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.880 
relatively well on bars and then we went
to<00:03:08.129> ball<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.659> continued<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:09.780> build<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
to ball and continued to build on that I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.459 
to ball and continued to build on that I
don't<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.640> scores<00:03:11.879> reflect<00:03:12.439> what<00:03:13.439> we

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
don't think the scores reflect what we

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.470 
don't think the scores reflect what we
were<00:03:13.739> trying<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.609> accomplish<00:03:14.909> out<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:15.329> but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
were trying to accomplish out there but

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.149 
were trying to accomplish out there but
I<00:03:15.510> when<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.409> look<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.650> our<00:03:16.739> girls<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.099> our

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
I when you just look at our girls in our

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.089 
I when you just look at our girls in our
performance<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.760> was<00:03:17.879> pretty<00:03:18.030> happy<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:19.069> lot<00:03:20.069> of

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
performance I was pretty happy a lot of

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.500 
performance I was pretty happy a lot of
us<00:03:20.310> Highlands<00:03:20.819> we've<00:03:20.909> heard<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.120> them<00:03:21.209> lived

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
us Highlands we've heard of them lived

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.619 
us Highlands we've heard of them lived
on<00:03:21.629> I<00:03:21.659> set<00:03:22.230> backwards<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.599> you<00:03:24.599> know

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
on I set backwards so I you know

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:25.699 
on I set backwards so I you know
consistently<00:03:25.200> been<00:03:25.319> working<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.680> that

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
consistently been working on that

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.410 
consistently been working on that
landing<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.549> just<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.939> little<00:03:27.209> bit<00:03:27.299> more

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
landing so it's just a little bit more

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.259 
landing so it's just a little bit more
focused<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.549> had<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> few<00:03:29.939> sticks<00:03:30.150> in

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
focused on it but we had a few sticks in

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.629 
focused on it but we had a few sticks in
the<00:03:30.359> lineup<00:03:30.689> we<00:03:31.159> we<00:03:32.159> didn't<00:03:32.400> have<00:03:32.519> been

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
the lineup we we didn't have been

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.539 
the lineup we we didn't have been
training<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:34.109> it's<00:03:34.439> just<00:03:34.560> continuing<00:03:35.459> to

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
training so it's just continuing to

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.080 
training so it's just continuing to
drill<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:35.849> little<00:03:35.939> things<00:03:36.329> in<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.689> land

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
drill a little things in the land

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:50.490 
drill a little things in the land
I<00:03:47.250> felt<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.280> my<00:03:48.690> floor<00:03:49.690> routine<00:03:49.930> was<00:03:50.140> very

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
I felt like my floor routine was very

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.619 
I felt like my floor routine was very
clean<00:03:50.830> I've<00:03:51.730> been<00:03:51.879> really<00:03:52.060> working<00:03:52.269> on<00:03:52.510> my

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
clean I've been really working on my

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.240 
clean I've been really working on my
double<00:03:52.810> back<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.349> making<00:03:53.530> sure<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:54.099> it's

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
double back and making sure that it's

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.210 
double back and making sure that it's
finishing<00:03:54.549> tall<00:03:55.000> not<00:03:55.989> slow<00:03:56.319> power<00:03:56.980> isn't

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
finishing tall not slow power isn't

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.479 
finishing tall not slow power isn't
really<00:03:57.720> my<00:03:58.720> aspect<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.349> gymnastics<00:03:59.620> I<00:04:00.220> try<00:04:00.430> to

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
really my aspect in gymnastics I try to

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.580 
really my aspect in gymnastics I try to
show<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.879> off<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.120> country<00:04:01.360> as<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.480> can<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:02.019> think

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
show it off the country as I can I think

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.869 
show it off the country as I can I think
Megan<00:04:02.860> started<00:04:03.129> us<00:04:03.280> off<00:04:03.400> really<00:04:03.640> well<00:04:03.730> on

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
Megan started us off really well on

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.990 
Megan started us off really well on
floor<00:04:04.680> when<00:04:05.680> we<00:04:05.799> got<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.250> third<00:04:06.400> spot<00:04:06.610> on

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
floor when we got to the third spot on

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.759 
floor when we got to the third spot on
floor<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.599> thought<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.959> really<00:04:08.140> started<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.620> hit

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
floor I thought we really started to hit

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.400 
floor I thought we really started to hit
our<00:04:08.890> stride<00:04:08.980> again<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.989> unfortunately<00:04:10.989> we<00:04:11.319> had

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
our stride again so unfortunately we had

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.600 
our stride again so unfortunately we had
a<00:04:11.440> hiccup<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.860> floor<00:04:12.099> in<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.250> middle<00:04:12.310> there

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
a hiccup on floor in the middle there

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.490 
a hiccup on floor in the middle there
but<00:04:12.790> other<00:04:13.269> than<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.540> couple<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.079> little<00:04:14.230> steps

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
but other than a couple of little steps

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.660 
but other than a couple of little steps
on<00:04:14.650> landings<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.040> thought<00:04:15.190> we<00:04:15.310> did<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.459> really

this meat being sandwiched between two
bitter<00:04:24.639> rivals<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:26.040> felt<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.100> girls<00:04:27.340> did<00:04:27.610> a

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
bitter rivals I felt the girls did a

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.250 
bitter rivals I felt the girls did a
really<00:04:27.850> good<00:04:27.970> job<00:04:28.030> we<00:04:28.419> had<00:04:28.600> some<00:04:28.810> energy<00:04:29.139> we

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
really good job we had some energy we

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.580 
really good job we had some energy we
had<00:04:29.380> some<00:04:29.590> pop<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:30.010> floor<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.820> was<00:04:31.060> exciting<00:04:31.690> we

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
had some pop on floor it was exciting we

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.379 
had some pop on floor it was exciting we
ended<00:04:32.800> up<00:04:32.889> doing<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.280> backup<00:04:33.639> routine<00:04:34.030> just

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
ended up doing the backup routine just

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.140 
ended up doing the backup routine just
to<00:04:34.630> get<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.780> good<00:04:34.960> scoring<00:04:35.350> but<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.610> turned<00:04:36.970> out

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
to get a good scoring but it turned out

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.240 
to get a good scoring but it turned out
really<00:04:37.419> really<00:04:37.810> well<00:04:38.110> we<00:04:38.530> always<00:04:38.710> trained<00:04:39.100> the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
really really well we always trained the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.469 
really really well we always trained the
big<00:04:39.400> routine<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.510> we<00:04:40.810> know<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.320> can<00:04:42.070> do<00:04:42.220> the

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
big routine and I we know I can do the

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.330 
big routine and I we know I can do the
watered-down<00:04:43.479> routine<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.139> lot<00:04:44.289> easier<00:04:44.470> this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
watered-down routine a lot easier this

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.520 
watered-down routine a lot easier this
week<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.760> just<00:04:45.789> depended<00:04:46.570> on<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.810> scoring<00:04:47.200> and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
week it just depended on the scoring and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.110 
week it just depended on the scoring and
how<00:04:47.620> scores<00:04:48.010> we're<00:04:48.220> going<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:48.580> figured<00:04:48.880> go

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
how scores we're going we figured go

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.629 
how scores we're going we figured go
with<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.260> easy<00:04:50.560> routine<00:04:51.100> that<00:04:51.220> we<00:04:51.340> know<00:04:51.490> we

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
with the easy routine that we know we

00:04:51.639 --> 00:05:01.030 
with the easy routine that we know we
can<00:04:51.789> get<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:51.940> score<00:04:52.240> with

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.839 

while<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:02.120> end<00:05:02.420> up

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.239 

well<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.449> I<00:05:07.569> really<00:05:08.080> felt<00:05:08.289> like<00:05:08.439> our<00:05:08.679> last<00:05:08.889> three

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:09.249 
well I I really felt like our last three

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:13.169 
well I I really felt like our last three
girls<00:05:09.520> did<00:05:09.759> a<00:05:09.789> phenomenal<00:05:10.119> job<00:05:11.429> I'm<00:05:12.429> being<00:05:12.699> I

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:13.179 
girls did a phenomenal job I'm being I

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:17.279 
girls did a phenomenal job I'm being I
felt<00:05:13.659> like<00:05:13.809> Bri<00:05:13.959> did<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.289> great<00:05:14.529> job<00:05:14.939> I<00:05:16.289> really

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
felt like Bri did a great job I really

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.169 
felt like Bri did a great job I really
like<00:05:17.469> to<00:05:17.619> originate<00:05:17.949> I<00:05:18.249> felt<00:05:18.729> like<00:05:18.819> she<00:05:19.029> was

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:19.179 
like to originate I felt like she was

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.659 
like to originate I felt like she was
moving<00:05:19.719> very<00:05:19.899> fluidly<00:05:20.499> and<00:05:20.860> very<00:05:21.129> solid<00:05:21.550> and

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
moving very fluidly and very solid and

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.399 
moving very fluidly and very solid and
then<00:05:22.240> we<00:05:22.330> went<00:05:22.419> to<00:05:22.539> Megan<00:05:22.869> and<00:05:22.990> she<00:05:23.080> knocked<00:05:23.259> it

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
then we went to Megan and she knocked it

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.169 
then we went to Megan and she knocked it
out<00:05:23.499> of<00:05:23.529> the<00:05:23.649> park<00:05:23.889> and<00:05:24.249> then<00:05:24.729> we<00:05:24.819> finished<00:05:25.089> up

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:25.179 
out of the park and then we finished up

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:26.909 
out of the park and then we finished up
with<00:05:25.300> Kaitlyn<00:05:25.689> and<00:05:25.899> I<00:05:26.289> thought<00:05:26.649> she<00:05:26.770> did<00:05:26.889> a

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
with Kaitlyn and I thought she did a

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.799 
with Kaitlyn and I thought she did a
great<00:05:27.159> job<00:05:27.189> we<00:05:27.669> ended<00:05:27.879> up<00:05:27.969> having<00:05:28.119> to<00:05:28.300> inquire

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:28.809 
great job we ended up having to inquire

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:29.999 
great job we ended up having to inquire
at<00:05:28.959> the<00:05:29.080> end<00:05:29.199> because<00:05:29.349> there<00:05:29.589> was<00:05:29.679> a<00:05:29.709> start

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
at the end because there was a start

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.859 
at the end because there was a start
value<00:05:30.039> issue<00:05:30.490> there<00:05:30.849> and<00:05:31.270> we<00:05:31.599> ended<00:05:31.749> up

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:31.869 
value issue there and we ended up

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:34.409 
value issue there and we ended up
getting<00:05:32.610> winning<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.699> argument<00:05:33.849> getting<00:05:34.300> our

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
getting winning the argument getting our

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.659 
getting winning the argument getting our
10th<00:05:34.629> back<00:05:34.809> on<00:05:34.990> start<00:05:35.289> value<00:05:35.529> but<00:05:35.679> but<00:05:36.069> but<00:05:36.639> i

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
10th back on start value but but but i

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.459 
10th back on start value but but but i
do<00:05:36.759> really<00:05:37.300> think<00:05:37.809> that<00:05:37.959> those<00:05:38.080> last<00:05:38.349> three

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
do really think that those last three

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.679 
do really think that those last three
knocked<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:38.979> out<00:05:39.069> of<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.219> park<00:05:39.429> IV<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:40.330> i<00:05:40.449> felt

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 
knocked it out of the park IV and i felt

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.809 
knocked it out of the park IV and i felt
like<00:05:40.719> i<00:05:40.869> was<00:05:41.019> steady<00:05:41.259> I<00:05:41.349> felt<00:05:41.709> like<00:05:41.769> my<00:05:41.830> first<00:05:42.099> a

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
like i was steady I felt like my first a

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.439 
like i was steady I felt like my first a
chrome<00:05:43.389> it<00:05:43.599> was<00:05:43.779> really<00:05:44.019> good<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.229> felt<00:05:44.619> all<00:05:44.830> my

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
chrome it was really good I felt all my

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.029 
chrome it was really good I felt all my
flight<00:05:46.449> series<00:05:46.869> was<00:05:47.139> steady<00:05:47.379> over<00:05:47.529> the<00:05:47.649> center

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
flight series was steady over the center

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.570 
flight series was steady over the center
and<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:49.360> jumps<00:05:49.659> were<00:05:49.809> good<00:05:49.959> I<00:05:50.369> felt<00:05:51.369> like<00:05:51.399> it

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
and the jumps were good I felt like it

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.009 
and the jumps were good I felt like it
was<00:05:51.819> one<00:05:51.999> of<00:05:52.029> the<00:05:52.209> best<00:05:52.360> routine<00:05:52.659> I've<00:05:52.869> done

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:53.019 
was one of the best routine I've done

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.439 
was one of the best routine I've done
all<00:05:53.139> year<00:05:53.379> i<00:05:53.439> essentially<00:05:54.249> with<00:05:54.999> a<00:05:55.209> little

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
all year i essentially with a little

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:56.999 
all year i essentially with a little
baby<00:05:55.599> shuffle<00:05:56.050> step<00:05:56.289> step<00:05:56.319> the<00:05:56.769> one<00:05:56.889> and<00:05:56.979> a

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
baby shuffle step step the one and a

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.290 
baby shuffle step step the one and a
half<00:05:57.039> which<00:05:57.399> was<00:05:57.639> kind<00:05:57.939> of<00:05:57.969> a<00:05:58.059> bit<00:05:58.209> of

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
half which was kind of a bit of

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.389 
half which was kind of a bit of
punishment<00:05:58.779> when<00:05:59.649> I'm<00:05:59.800> not<00:05:59.919> gonna<00:06:00.039> tow<00:06:00.189> path

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:00.399 
punishment when I'm not gonna tow path

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:02.070 
punishment when I'm not gonna tow path
we've<00:06:00.610> been<00:06:00.729> working<00:06:00.909> on<00:06:01.179> that<00:06:01.209> and<00:06:01.809> I<00:06:01.899> feel

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
we've been working on that and I feel

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.049 
we've been working on that and I feel
like<00:06:02.139> it<00:06:02.349> was<00:06:02.469> one<00:06:03.189> of<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.490> best<00:06:03.669> game<00:06:03.939> I<00:06:04.029> think

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:04.059 
like it was one of the best game I think
