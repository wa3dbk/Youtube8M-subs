00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.090
 hi are you in the channel of juanqui 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.880
 tutorials today we're going to do a little 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.400
 tutorial how to repair headphones 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 damaged 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.440
 in this case they brought me some 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.570
 headphones that 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.739
 says the client that does not sound a side 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.350
 and that flaw we have in this part if 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.620
 we raise this rule to realize that 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.420
 only one side of the headset sounds or you 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.090
 chokes the sounds on one side and the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.809
 another good side the first thing we have 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.809
 what to do is 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.670
 is to cut this part a good scissors 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.399
 I wanted to mention the material 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.190
 slightly we need a scissor 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.420
 we need the gun in the chapter 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.609
 we need tin a tester 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.820
 this gadget that is to peel the 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.180
 cable cited the handset we need the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.540
 paste and a lighter or match could 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.000
 like good let's start the first thing 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.740
 we have to do is cut this part 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.909
 the part that is damaged as we said to the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.159
 start we cut it 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.080
 we have to discover the two parts that 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.060
 we cut here and we have to stay 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 once we discover that part there 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.550
 these tips have to be left 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.580
 since they are the ones that carry the audio to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.040
 headset some headset against 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.230
 4 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.170
 and in other three good in this one that I 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.189
 they brought right now 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.189
 has 3 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.270
 let's go to the part that we cut here 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.710
 we have to discover this part and we 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.180
 It will stay like this so it does not have to be left 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.070
 discovered with the parts 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 the contacts where we are going to weld the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.660
 good wires 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.550
 we welded as we said with the gun the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.920
 parts the little tips we had 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.080
 covered let's go in this part 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.930
 the three the three points that come out or 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.200
 four o'clock and when there is one that is common 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.670
 that goes for the two sides that we join 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.550
 and the soldiers here in it 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.280
 in the negative part and we see the plus of 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.790
 we weld 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.880
 we talk the other 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.820
 like 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.520
 and it's going to stay like this so you do not have to 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.310
 stay 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.900
 the next step we have to do 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 is to try 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.930
 that has not been 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.090
 sounding both the two 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.719
 We play around with any apparatus 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.200
 audio and it's sounding both sounds to me 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.200
 perfectly 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.670
 and good 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.800
 and good 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.470
 it's an easy way to save us a 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.069
 money because headphones that are 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.989
 originals are expensive 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.060
 and here we are saving a little money 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.019
 well once we see that he has 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.489
 It looks good we have the thermos hose 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.749
 physical we cut a piece more or less 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.230
 calculating that we are covered this 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:28.230
 part 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.489
 and the following days 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.440
 the following would be 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.440
 turn on 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.250
 and we use this marketing 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.250
 we heat it 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.950
 uniformly 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:02.080
 be careful with the software and the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.090
 has to be left once you do not have to 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.349
 be squeezed carefully do not burn 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.349
 with a little bit of breath
