00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.810 

so<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.560> simply<00:00:01.860> state<00:00:02.070> entry<00:00:02.429> sensor

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so this is a simply state entry sensor

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.430 
so this is a simply state entry sensor
West<00:00:03.179> for<00:00:03.330> your<00:00:03.449> doors<00:00:03.659> or<00:00:03.840> windows<00:00:03.929> or<00:00:04.290> any

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
West for your doors or windows or any

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.710 
West for your doors or windows or any
entrance<00:00:04.890> just<00:00:05.790> like<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.060> keypad<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.600> also

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
entrance just like the keypad it also

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.390 
entrance just like the keypad it also
comes<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.529> screws<00:00:07.830> which<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.189> want<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
comes with the screws which you want to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.000 
comes with the screws which you want to
screw<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.670> onto<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.030> wall<00:00:09.179> or<00:00:09.420> board<00:00:09.950> what<00:00:10.950> do

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
screw it onto the wall or board what do

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.490 
screw it onto the wall or board what do
you<00:00:11.070> think<00:00:11.280> use<00:00:11.429> your<00:00:11.580> tape<00:00:12.080> stop<00:00:13.080> opening<00:00:13.380> it

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
you think use your tape stop opening it

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.140 
you think use your tape stop opening it
up<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:14.549> have<00:00:14.580> two<00:00:14.820> pieces<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:17.150> sensor

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
up you have two pieces one is the sensor

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
up you have two pieces one is the sensor
unit<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.050> wanted<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.380> magnet<00:00:19.710> part

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.660 

so<00:00:32.830> once<00:00:33.040> you<00:00:33.100> gotta<00:00:33.250> come<00:00:33.430> up<00:00:33.490> with<00:00:33.580> these

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
so once you gotta come up with these

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.420 
so once you gotta come up with these
little<00:00:33.940> screws<00:00:37.560> and<00:00:38.560> there's<00:00:39.220> that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
little screws and there's that

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.700 
little screws and there's that
activation<00:00:40.239> battery<00:00:40.750> tab<00:00:41.080> just<00:00:41.470> like<00:00:41.620> the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
activation battery tab just like the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
activation battery tab just like the
keypad<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.100> pull<00:00:42.520> it<00:00:42.580> off<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.930> actually

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
keypad you pull it off and it's actually

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.760 
keypad you pull it off and it's actually
so<00:00:49.570> you've<00:00:49.720> heard<00:00:49.840> of<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.020> base<00:00:50.200> stations<00:00:50.559> day

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
so you've heard of the base stations day

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.520 
so you've heard of the base stations day
energy<00:00:51.100> sensor<00:00:52.080> they<00:00:53.080> just<00:00:53.230> take<00:00:53.410> off<00:00:53.470> that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
energy sensor they just take off that

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:04.380 
energy sensor they just take off that
piece<00:00:53.830> of<00:00:53.980> tape<00:00:57.960> onto<00:00:58.960> the<00:01:03.000> stick<00:01:04.000> out<00:01:04.120> this

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
piece of tape onto the stick out this

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
piece of tape onto the stick out this
side<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.870> frame

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000 

and<00:01:11.970> we'll<00:01:12.090> stick<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.390> sensor<00:01:12.750> magnet<00:01:13.380> onto

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and we'll stick the sensor magnet onto

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
and we'll stick the sensor magnet onto
the<00:01:14.130> door<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.690> steps<00:01:15.870> yourself

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the door and on the steps yourself

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
the door and on the steps yourself
there's<00:01:16.470> two<00:01:16.650> paths<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.100> I'll<00:01:17.190> show<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.370> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
there's two paths and I'll show you that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.140 
there's two paths and I'll show you that
later

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
later

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.970 
later
you<00:01:18.780> met<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.050> magnetic<00:01:19.410> sensor<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
you met the magnetic sensor to be

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.760 
you met the magnetic sensor to be
between<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:21.990> lines<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.800> sensor

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.050 

the<00:01:28.770> Mack<00:01:28.980> is<00:01:29.160> strong<00:01:29.430> enough<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the Mack is strong enough so that you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
the Mack is strong enough so that you
can<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.330> be<00:01:30.540> two<00:01:30.780> inches<00:01:31.020> away<00:01:31.290> it'll

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
can actually be two inches away it'll

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:46.090 
can actually be two inches away it'll
stall<00:01:32.190> detect<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:33.330> sensor<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.910> works

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.470 

so<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.610> mentioned<00:01:47.910> earlier<00:01:47.940> when<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
so as I mentioned earlier when you

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.180 
so as I mentioned earlier when you
install<00:01:48.780> these<00:01:48.930> sensors<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.740> entry

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
install these sensors these entry

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.790 
install these sensors these entry
sensors<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> sensor<00:01:52.230> itself<00:01:52.350> you'll<00:01:52.620> see

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
sensors on the sensor itself you'll see

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.190 
sensors on the sensor itself you'll see
two<00:01:53.160> markings<00:01:54.120> and<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.600> want<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> magnet

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
two markings and you want the magnet

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
two markings and you want the magnet
side<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.460> laying<00:01:56.790> between<00:01:56.970> those<00:01:57.360> two

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
side to be laying between those two

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
side to be laying between those two
markings<00:01:58.260> so<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.280> put<00:01:59.400> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.580> door<00:01:59.760> like

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
markings so you can put on the door like

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850 
markings so you can put on the door like
this<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.690> lets<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:01.020> copy<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> two

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
this and it lets you copy up to two

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.500 
this and it lets you copy up to two
inches<00:02:02.160> away<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.940> your<00:02:03.180> surfaces<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
inches away on your surfaces so this is

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.169 
inches away on your surfaces so this is
another<00:02:06.720> entry<00:02:07.080> sensor<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:08.010> a

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
another entry sensor and we have a

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.700 
another entry sensor and we have a
second<00:02:09.179> door<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> house<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.470> unique

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
second door in the house and the unique

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.230 
second door in the house and the unique
thing<00:02:10.740> with<00:02:11.010> this<00:02:11.130> door<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> an

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
thing with this door is that is that an

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.850 
thing with this door is that is that an
even<00:02:12.450> surface<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.320> their<00:02:13.470> sensors<00:02:13.740> aren't

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
even surface so their sensors aren't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
even surface so their sensors aren't
going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> line<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.310> next<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> each<00:02:15.180> other<00:02:15.390> but

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
going to line up next to each other but

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.990 
going to line up next to each other but
the<00:02:16.170> beauty<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.620> system<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the beauty with this system is that the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.850 
the beauty with this system is that the
sensors<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.780> actually<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.170> two<00:02:19.380> inches<00:02:19.680> away

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
sensors can actually be two inches away

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.160 
sensors can actually be two inches away
and<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:20.970> even<00:02:21.300> services<00:02:21.840> aren't<00:02:22.050> a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and so that even services aren't a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.260 
and so that even services aren't a
problem<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.940> just<00:02:23.940> pull<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> battery<00:02:25.260> off

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
problem at all just pull the battery off

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.760 
problem at all just pull the battery off
look<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.100> key<00:02:29.340> step<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.620> actually

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
look in a key step and you can actually

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.690 
look in a key step and you can actually
put<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.709> surf<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
put this on and you can surf this the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
put this on and you can surf this the
magnet<00:02:39.030> goes<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.390> door<00:02:39.630> between<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.290> two

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
magnet goes on the door between the two

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.440 
magnet goes on the door between the two
markings<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.940> sensor<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:44.300> since<00:02:45.300> they're

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
markings on the sensor and since they're
