ingredients in the Vitamix the first
thing<00:00:22.740> you're<00:00:22.890> gonna<00:00:22.980> add<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.939> 1<00:00:24.570> cup<00:00:24.779> of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
thing you're gonna add is 1 cup of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.170 
thing you're gonna add is 1 cup of
almonds<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.619> 1<00:00:25.710> cup<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> cashews<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.789> reason

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
almonds and 1 cup of cashews the reason

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
almonds and 1 cup of cashews the reason
why<00:00:27.300> you're<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.539> doing<00:00:27.869> all<00:00:28.050> almonds<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
why you're not doing all almonds is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
why you're not doing all almonds is
because<00:00:29.400> cashew<00:00:29.880> nuts<00:00:30.090> are<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> little<00:00:30.750> more

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
because cashew nuts are a little more

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.780 
because cashew nuts are a little more
high<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.289> fat<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.949> they're<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> little<00:00:32.399> creamier

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
high in fat so they're a little creamier

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.639 
high in fat so they're a little creamier
and<00:00:32.910> they'll<00:00:33.030> add<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.570> nice<00:00:33.870> creamy<00:00:34.200> texture<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and they'll add a nice creamy texture to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.470
