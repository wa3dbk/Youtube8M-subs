forth in that area there the console

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100 
forth in that area there the console
itself<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.450> injected<00:00:45.899> molded

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

plastic type console that was
specifically<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:49.980> together<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> car

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
specifically put together for this car

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.610 
specifically put together for this car
whether<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
whether or not it's going to be

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
whether or not it's going to be
available<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> future<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> hard<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.059> say

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
available in the future it's hard to say

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
available in the future it's hard to say
but<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> configuration<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.649> quite<00:00:55.860> nice<00:00:56.070> but

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you get an idea of where you can put

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.990 
you get an idea of where you can put
stuff<00:00:57.570> Michael<00:00:58.109> armrest<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:59.010> Pelican

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

flashlights stored in between the
weapons<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.160> again<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.969> configure<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
weapons but again you can configure this

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
weapons but again you can configure this
car<00:01:03.660> more<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:03.960> less<00:01:04.049> anyway<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.650> wish<00:01:04.890> to
