00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Mission 7 but still there is nothing to 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 comes from the fourth mission for sweet 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.370
 johnson well on arrival we will see the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.740
 colleagues who are playing dominoes to this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.750
 life is a lot and this ryder is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 scoring the scores 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.580
 and they are still today 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.020
 and ryder I do not know seems to be angry that 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 come so I do not know what's wrong with this 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.880
 subject and in that it goes on and asks what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
 serious tit count weapons 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 not with what weapons are we fighting against 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.030
 the enemies that are the bullets and other 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.190
 rounds in that tells us that there is a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.730
 person who supplied us with weapons that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.730
 it was evit 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.800
 but nevertheless this subject has 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.630
 a little old merchandise a little bit already 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.160
 outdated 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.680
 and what it takes a gangster like 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.430
 they are doing in suite that is the case 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.650
 they are not same shotguns this fuse yes 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.150
 not that not but good as of another option 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.800
 meanwhile we have to go only 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.470
 aemet alright so let's go with same 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.740
 to the house of metz 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.930
 during the trip if it leads to ask 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.930
 about what happened or not with some 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.650
 families because they are separated so much and 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.190
 well simply abyss talks about those 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.200
 known phrases and gossip d'estudis 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.180
 that the book although one knows that the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.670
 book is no but good we are already 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.790
 arriving when we have reached the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.920
 pets house okay now it activates a 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.630
 song where we see the subject that is 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.450
 the one with an edition 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.729
 and he thinks that good was a shot no 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.100
 and think that we were what 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.030
 we shoot a little nutty good is 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.340
 understandable old man then he gets confused 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.200
 a little bit confused with bryant that was 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.340
 the younger brother of forgiveness suit 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.170
 kart and good a little gives you the condolences 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.009
 about his beloved beautiful face passed away 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.800
 in that he tells the reason for his 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.630
 visit that is in arms and he says that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.130
 It has very good quality weapons but 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.110
 they nevertheless upon realizing they are given 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.599
 mind that is useless, I suppose 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.470
 because you can not see what weapons have been seen 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.010
 in that container ok this here is a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.420
 small little practice shooting 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.489
 practice as well as when we did the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.380
 basile mission the good shooter is not 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.780
 So much so, but this is a small 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.640
 practice and good is made up of four 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.410
 rounds is the second round we do not have 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.140
 have to shoot three bottles 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.060
 let's try our marksmanship so 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.510
 let's aim well for only 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.069
 spend a bullet 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.840
 girl we overcome 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.260
 this was the second the first one was 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.329
 it was just a bottle to shoot and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.069
 in the third test we are going to learn 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.069
 to roll over on the floor 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.890
 also simple a bit to dodge 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.500
 we bend over and roll that is also 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.660
 cash so it does not cost us so fast 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.360
 while we're going to fuck with you is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.340
 fat fat man has got tired 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.340
 and we turn with d 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.900
 either to the right and the left 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.920
 then we shoot the last bottles 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.180
 and with this we finished the third round 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.549
 boots tell her vision pretty easy 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.610
 it's not complicated and the last round 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.450
 we have to shoot what is before 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.640
 you can gasoline we fire and you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.480
 finished this mission practically finished 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.790
 in that same again again talk about 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:52.700
 his known sayings and all that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.730
 and then you are ready to go and emt 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.819
 keep saying that 100% support 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.280
 that his place will always be 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.560
 available to them and that is the best 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.409
 solution and that has brand of hurt of 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.750
 high quality when in reality your 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.000
 merchandise is to do more than doing 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.459
 good over 30 years ago 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.180
 good still outdated in time now 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.310
 to complete the mission 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.120
 we have to take the abyss to its 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.160
 house is tired of the uncle I do not know to give 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.320
 about two laps has not reached them in 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.240
 until cap is understood and then 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.370
 during the road again they had gone in 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.759
 train road again chasm to talk 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.919
 of your acquaintances I do not know words of 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.639
 psychologist gets psychologists to do 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.680
 effective psychiatrist good whatever it is not 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.919
 things sometimes a little bit in that sense 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.830
 that right now they have nothing to do 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.690
 practically no but well we have already 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.780
 come to the middle red mark to your 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.610
 home and we just do not say goodbye 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.110
 abyss in this way we are already almost 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.490
 almost combining but we received a 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.900
 called this call is from suites in the 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.900
 let us know a bit as the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.180
 attention saying that we have to 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.360
 wear the colors of the band if 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.370
 we have to characterize we have to 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.000
 show that we have returned street and 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.400
 we have to dress with the green color 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.740
 what is the characteristic color of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.750
 two families well then in this 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.790
 mission is blocked what are the stores 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.360
 of clothes 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.940
 it would be vinko not that it is the first store 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.370
 that is unlocked already with the passing 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.950
 missions are going to unlock the 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.580
 following stores that are already a little 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.620
 more expensive vinko is the most economical 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.960
 well then let's go to vinko that 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.629
 is near the giant gym there 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.379
 is on the red or yellow mac mark on 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:06:01.430
 the radar and changing clothes is optional 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:03.710
 and you can change that option or not 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.020
 ocean has nothing to do with a 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.770
 vision you can enter simply what 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.780
 what are we going to do now we enter a bit 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.250
 gives us a little tutorial about the 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.740
 Store not be like changing clothes 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.960
 where to position ourselves and all that then 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.840
 you can choose to change clothes or 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.530
 just go out as what I'm going to 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.379
 I do well in those moments of equal 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:32.030
 way the emission poster will come out 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.919
 overcome and where they give us good respect 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.990
 that was the video I hope you liked 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.379
 see you in the next video follows of
