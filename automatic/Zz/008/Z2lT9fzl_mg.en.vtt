00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.750
 and master and king of Mexican cuisine the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.210
 chile is the sesame seed of all moles 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 and of the generous variety of types of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 Chile that are offered in the market on 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.270
 apple tree is painted only the surprise is that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 it is spicy product of yellow color and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.210
 similar to an apple comes from 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.279
 South America even if you do not believe it 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.379
 this and other secrets about his 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.989
 culture are the subject of study of 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.390
 doctor mario perez from the department of 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.420
 breeding of the autonomous university 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.420
 chapingo 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.860
 the manzano chile is a type of chile 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.130
 that is not curiously originating from 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.710
 Mexico is from South America 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.400
 but it was very very little studied 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.570
 does not exist 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.510
 back of the 90s studies on the type 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.100
 of chile however there are areas of 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.070
 important production where is 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.090
 irreplaceable all cold areas 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.660
 fresh from sierra like the northern sierra 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.550
 of puebla cuatepec of flour tacámbaro 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.700
 michoacán in all those regions is 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.880
 irreplaceable this type of chile and is the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.720
 unique that adapts to cool areas 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.720
 mountainous 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 although the apple tree is sown 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.580
 underground and open sky the first 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.280
 secret to obtain a fresh product 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.470
 throughout the year is its cultivation in 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 greenhouse where it is protected from 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.210
 frost 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.130
 another advantage of planting it in this 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.710
 guard is that you can keep it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 away from pests and other diseases 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 caused by fungi and viruses 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.920
 the greenhouse not only protects us from 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.860
 the low temperatures also we 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.679
 protects from butterfly worms that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.380
 later the worm is the one that makes 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.500
 the problem in the fruit and also of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 acids and white mosquitoes that cause 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.959
 virosis to this type of chili other 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.500
 very important aspect is the control in 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.769
 fit will opt and caps and if this disease 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.000
 known as hip is the 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.400
 main problem that the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.190
 open-field producers the inoculum 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.590
 is on the ground and invades the plant and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.650
 die plants when they already have a 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.489
 year of age or it may be earlier 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.730
 is this problem is being solved 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.130
 using clean substrate substrate 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.270
 known as test man 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.270
 it's a sand 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.510
 well sterile and is inert in such a way 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.870
 that we can use nutritious solutions and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.599
 come free of this pathogen 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.060
 the direct sun does not favor the 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.099
 apple tree chili cultivation doctor 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.750
 mario perez and his collaborators have 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.060
 determined the exact amount of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.640
 solar radiation that should receive the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.680
 plant 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.650
 this is a shade plant 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.160
 requires about one third of the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.610
 radiation on a sunny day in the area 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.640
 of high valleys let's say on May 10 a 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.580
 third of that radiation we already measured it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.100
 they are 550 micromoles of photons per meter 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.230
 square per second that translated are 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.170
 one third of the incident radiation in 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.510
 a sunny day of May 10 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.030
 to ensure that the plant takes advantage 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.800
 solar radiation to the maximum and that carries 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.680
 out photosynthesis so 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.560
 adequate the researchers employ a 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.870
 special technique 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.360
 we drive the plant to two meters from 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.110
 height 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.110
 and we have a tutoring system above 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.110
 with wires to drive like 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.840
 if it were a chayotera the plant with 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.060
 fruits falls on this system of your 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.040
 bullfighting wires and then we can 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.500
 easily harvest the fruits to two 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 meters high 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.580
 another of the secrets revealed to us by the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.370
 doctor mario pérez is that the more 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.430
 seeds have a bigger chili will be your 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.709
 growth and to achieve an increase in 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.140
 the amount of seeds is necessary 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.060
 ensure optimal pollination of the 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.470
 flowers 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.410
 this happens with the vibration that the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.570
 wind causes in the plants in addition the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.950
 researchers have the help of 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.620
 the pollinating bumblebees 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.810
 finally the time of harvest comes 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.760
 of the apple trees after the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.800
 collection proceeds exams for 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.800
 determine the most peaks parts as 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.280
 here the interesting thing that 10% of 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.460
 all this content of cap 6 in today des 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.610
 is found in the pericarp in the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.270
 fleshy part what we consume 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.280
 and 70% is found in the endo carpio 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.340
 I know where the seeds are where 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.539
 the seeds are not located in the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.050
 seeds where the 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:15.560
 seeds to what is known as veins 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.650
 there we have 70% and the other 20% is 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.960
 just in the seeds then yes 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.650
 they want me to explain it, you know 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.650
 what to choose 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.430
 from the laboratory to the table plate 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.469
 Manzano chili is the ingredient 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.309
 main of an infinity of dishes 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.309
 In America 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.760
 the uses of the apple tree are diverse 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.590
 In fact, we compiled it through a 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.610
 book that is called the delights of the 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.380
 apple and chili recipes are 100 100 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.950
 recipes for 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.350
 for consumers in South America 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.950
 Central America and of course Mexico 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.290
 then in that kind of nc in that 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.910
 in that document all are compiled 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.000
 the uses of apple-tree chile that are 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:13.630
 around 100 from creams the use in 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.590
 fresh direct soups good n 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.590
 possibilities of the use of apple-tree chili 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.190
 among the hottest chilies the apple tree 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.930
 It ranks second after 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.000
 habanero 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.340
 and for those who prefer it over 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.340
 of any spicy greenhouses of 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.660
 the Autonomous University of Chapingo 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.380
 they ensure the best quality of so 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.380
 delicious fruit
