00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.460
 the law is harsh but most on him 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.540
 don't give a damn when law enforcement officers 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 idle the crowd is taken 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.740
 most of the participants no more than 20 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.510
 years the main task of stupid boors to force 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.190
 pereparkovatsya all violators in 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.560
 case of failure sticker on the windshield 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.600
 before it starts, the action attracts 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.820
 attention of passersby people are always hungry 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 to the spectacles support the participants we 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.010
 because it is interesting 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.470
 it's unusual i think i have the right to wear it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 nose it's time to brother with him for closer 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.700
 communicating it turns out one girl in life 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 pedestrian 2 is no different from those 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.260
 I donâ€™t know the sticker 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 I can not answer the question because I 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 never got behind the wheel of course i 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 not encouraging but at the same time there is no room in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.250
 especially in the center of the city to park 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.070
 therefore sometimes it is necessary 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.110
 but before the stickers find their owners 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.300
 but most of the drivers are cars 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.250
 No, and those who are behind the wheel gritting their teeth all 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.350
 same drive off to resist 40 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.750
 heated young men do not want 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.699
 activists need to drive Moscow shares 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.080
 often end up beating on 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.360
 travels are not only 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.670
 agree with the stop boors some 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.500
 I think the guys just have nothing to do 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.000
 I do not support any such 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.040
 social movements when people 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.690
 are going to decide to stop others from living and 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.190
 still one wrong 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.350
 parked and very unlucky 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.390
 leaving the car on the sidewalk near the house 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.490
 like a hundred times before a man got 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.110
 on pencil activists not wanting stickers 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 on the windshield down to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.160
 drive off near the car gbdd 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.009
 a minute behind the wheel can cost the driver 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.080
 parking rights and riding on the sidewalk plus on 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.850
 Backyard Saturday seems like a man at home only 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.410
 what took on the chest case 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270
 rare that the place immediately appeared 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.670

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.979
 cad and sure man in car affairs 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.530
 we are increasingly becoming people with us 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.180
 it becomes more arrogant and they would not 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.490
 pay attention to what is 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.439
 pedestrians are people just like them 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.420
 a third lasted over 2 hours on 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.610
 question why do you need to answer 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.619
 surely primordial in his movie a lot in 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.960
 Internet future drivers unreal

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.690
 there is a little sister on the sidewalk 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.890
 the stroller that go too again bothers 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.870
 that's actually decided after this 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.760
 do this the most important thing on the net who 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.590
 park not by the rules also be called 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.420
 we have hundreds of reasons why they do it 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.489
 they are no other places in a hurry and the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.500
 similar and in some ways will be right 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.989
 treat laws like dogma but how 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.280
 the obstacle has become habitual for us 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.019
 most of the attendees do not have 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.700
 their cars for them is the usual time 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.650
