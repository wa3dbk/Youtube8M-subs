gonna do we pass it across we do get the

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.930 
gonna do we pass it across we do get the
advantage<00:07:28.220> which<00:07:28.580> would<00:07:28.729> have<00:07:28.789> been<00:07:28.850> a

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940 
advantage which would have been a

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.810
