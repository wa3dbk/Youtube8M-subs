when people are picking things up all

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.430 
when people are picking things up all
the<00:00:46.789> muscles<00:00:47.089> that<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:47.510> use<00:00:47.780> in<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.109> seated

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
position we want it to be in such

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.840 
position we want it to be in such
position<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.210> when<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:02.050> forearm

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
position so that when the forearm

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.399 
position so that when the forearm
reaches<00:01:03.850> our<00:01:04.000> torso<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.809> intersects<00:01:05.229> it

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
reaches our torso it intersects it

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.640 
reaches our torso it intersects it
around<00:01:05.619> 90<00:01:06.159> degrees<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.960> we<00:01:08.080> can<00:01:08.260> lift<00:01:08.470> the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
around 90 degrees so we can lift the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.380 
around 90 degrees so we can lift the
handle<00:01:09.010> just<00:01:09.250> down<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.700> left<00:01:09.850> hand<00:01:10.030> side

make<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.310> machine<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:15.200> quite<00:02:16.200> often<00:02:16.350> see

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
make on this machine we quite often see

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.880 
make on this machine we quite often see
people<00:02:17.420> they<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:18.540> pull<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.140> bicep<00:02:19.680> but

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
people they will pull with the bicep but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890 
people they will pull with the bicep but
they'll<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.190> forget<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.790> engage<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.510> muscles

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
they'll be forget to engage the muscles

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.780 
they'll be forget to engage the muscles
around<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.620> shoulder<00:02:22.680> girdle<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.460> mid<00:02:23.670> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
around the shoulder girdle that mid and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.080 
around the shoulder girdle that mid and
lower<00:02:23.940> trapezius<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.830> for<00:02:26.460> these<00:02:26.550> people<00:02:26.610> we

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
lower trapezius so for these people we

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.660 
lower trapezius so for these people we
want<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> make<00:02:27.630> sure<00:02:27.660> we<00:02:28.380> encourage<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
want to make sure we encourage the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.850 
want to make sure we encourage the
shoulders<00:02:30.090> are<00:02:30.240> down<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.200> pull<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> elbows

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
shoulders are down as we pull the elbows

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.070 
shoulders are down as we pull the elbows
through<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> side<00:02:35.330> what<00:02:36.330> we<00:02:36.450> also<00:02:36.630> see

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
through to the side what we also see

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.710 
through to the side what we also see
with<00:02:37.350> people<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.150> they<00:02:39.420> pull

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
with people on here is as they pull

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
with people on here is as they pull
through<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.740> try<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.040> pull<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:41.430> too<00:02:41.640> much

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
through they try and pull with too much

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.020 
through they try and pull with too much
bicep<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.540> forget<00:02:42.900> about<00:02:42.990> their<00:02:43.410> back<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.880> as

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
bicep and forget about their back so as

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360 
bicep and forget about their back so as
they<00:02:45.240> pull<00:02:45.480> through<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.959> handles<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
they pull through with the handles the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.090 
they pull through with the handles the
opera's<00:02:47.640> will<00:02:47.880> flare<00:02:48.330> out<00:02:48.570> why<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:49.860> want<00:02:50.070> to

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
opera's will flare out why we want to

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.729 
opera's will flare out why we want to
try<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> avoid<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.850> keep<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.780> elbows<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.380> we

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
try to avoid that keep the elbows as we

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.850 
try to avoid that keep the elbows as we
pull<00:02:52.980> through<00:02:53.220> coming<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.180> nice<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.050> tight<00:02:55.110> so

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
pull through coming in nice and tight so

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.300 
pull through coming in nice and tight so
we<00:02:55.980> open<00:02:56.370> up<00:02:56.459> through<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.239> chest

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
we open up through the chest

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.250 
we open up through the chest
the<00:02:59.310> final<00:02:59.700> thing<00:02:59.940> when<00:03:00.450> engaging<00:03:00.810> through

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
the final thing when engaging through

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.320 
the final thing when engaging through
the<00:03:01.380> back<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.670> make<00:03:02.790> sure<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:03.150> engage

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
the back we want to make sure we engage

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.390 
the back we want to make sure we engage
the<00:03:03.900> shoulder<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.500> shoulder<00:03:04.980> girdle<00:03:05.280> muscles

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the shoulder but shoulder girdle muscles

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.780 
the shoulder but shoulder girdle muscles
and<00:03:05.910> avoid<00:03:06.780> any<00:03:07.140> extension<00:03:08.040> through<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
and avoid any extension through the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.990 
and avoid any extension through the
spine<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.450> achieve<00:03:09.780> this

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.240 

to<00:03:14.000> create<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.360> balanced<00:03:14.900> program<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
to create a balanced program the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.760 
to create a balanced program the
opposite<00:03:16.670> action<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.240> this<00:03:17.390> will<00:03:18.260> be<00:03:18.380> doing<00:03:18.560> a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
opposite action to this will be doing a

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.940 
opposite action to this will be doing a
chest<00:03:19.070> press

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
chest press

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.339 
chest press
but<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.760> machine<00:03:21.970> we<00:03:22.420> do<00:03:22.840> have<00:03:22.989> different

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
but on this machine we do have different

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.050 
but on this machine we do have different
variations<00:03:24.040> you'll<00:03:24.489> see<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.790> there's<00:03:25.000> a

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
variations you'll see that there's a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.479 
variations you'll see that there's a
handle<00:03:25.390> across<00:03:25.720> top<00:03:26.050> here<00:03:26.349> now<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.220> say

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
handle across top here now I say

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.820 
handle across top here now I say
variation<00:03:28.269> he's<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.290> different

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
variation he's actually a different

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.020 
variation he's actually a different
recruitment<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.400> muscles<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:30.819> we're

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
recruitment of muscles that we're

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.380 
recruitment of muscles that we're
looking<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.390> achieve<00:03:32.640> when<00:03:33.640> holding<00:03:34.000> onto<00:03:34.180> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
looking to achieve when holding onto the

upper handle here we're looking to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.699 
upper handle here we're looking to
decrease<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.390> amount<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.690> latissimus<00:03:38.380> or

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
decrease the amount of latissimus or

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.830 
decrease the amount of latissimus or
lats<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.430> we're<00:03:39.849> looking<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.209> focus<00:03:40.390> into

lats and we're looking to focus into

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.220 
lats and we're looking to focus into
more<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.260> posterior<00:03:42.010> or<00:03:42.220> rhea<00:03:42.580> show<00:03:42.910> der

reach<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.560> line<00:04:05.739> about<00:04:05.980> two<00:04:06.190> awesome<00:04:06.579> a

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
reach the line about two awesome a

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.539 
reach the line about two awesome a
common<00:04:08.110> mistake<00:04:08.500> when<00:04:08.680> people<00:04:09.040> perform<00:04:09.370> this

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
common mistake when people perform this

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.479 
common mistake when people perform this
exercise<00:04:09.730> is<00:04:10.480> they<00:04:10.989> will<00:04:11.140> pull<00:04:11.440> but<00:04:12.250> they<00:04:12.370> will

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
exercise is they will pull but they will

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.550 
exercise is they will pull but they will
try<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:12.880> use<00:04:12.970> their<00:04:13.180> latissimus<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.410> the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
try and use their latissimus and so the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.920 
try and use their latissimus and so the
elbow<00:04:14.950> will<00:04:15.130> drop<00:04:15.430> down<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:16.359> is<00:04:16.540> incorrect

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
elbow will drop down this is incorrect
