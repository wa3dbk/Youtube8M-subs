00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.450
 good after the presentation of some 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.940
 games we need something here but I think 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 that if you lack a bit of speed that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.520
 is what is missing and are and then gave it to us 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.560
 in the form of real great game that seems 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.779
 that approaches although I do not want 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.699
 mount me movies because the same of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.939
 step with great tourism and in the end I 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.929
 I regret it is Driveclub 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.300

 I created your first driving game 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.489
 for this new generation of consoles 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.780
 you see that the graphics very well as 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.460
 we have seen in Killzone the effects 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 of lighting and especially those of the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 reflections in the spotlights of the car and in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.649
 first video that of kill we have not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.690
 seen with that glass building 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.969
 They are well polished and especially 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.440
 Shadows of the game are very good too 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.710
 and sincerely 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.159

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.119

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 door with your father calling you 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.270

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.060
 impressive and you see as well the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.280
 driver is buckled 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.270
 and unequivocal sign that it's going to start 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.130
 the little thing that sincerely paints very 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.460
 well here they were explaining the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.679
 game dynamics how would I do and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.020
 well then graphics costs and that 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.600
 They sincerely focused a lot on the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.509
 graphics on getting a little 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.450
 in sight the change that has taken place 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.940
 playstation3 to playstation 4 and good 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 Well apparently, maybe like 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.369
 that I think there is not much but 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.540
 well the experts say yes and if not 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.820
 we trust them who are we going to 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.130
 trust and then you see that you have started to 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.619
 I sincerely run when I saw this said 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.140
 how small is the crystal wafer 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.180
 in front of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.290
 and well, here they were sailing 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.819
 through the game menus through the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.630
 different options that the game will have 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.420
 there you see 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.280
 you have seen 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.770
 in a fraction of a second cars 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.110
 similar to formula 1 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.390
 that is to say that we will have a lot 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 variety of vehicles we are not going to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.150
 I think I 'm tired though, as I said 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.430
 before I hope not to disappoint me as I eat 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.840
 I did it with great tourism that I 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.090
 I bought thinking that it was one thing and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.520
 I found something totally different already 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.610
 that depending how good 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.170
 I hope I do not regret if I 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.150
 I buy this one day that is not safe 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.110
 because things can change 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.640
 very much and this has been everything for part 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.640
 from the drive club
