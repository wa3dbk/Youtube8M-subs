00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.830
 HB 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.369
 that of plants 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.529
 is not to be underestimated 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.939
 they can carry whole buildings 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.939
 To do this, they have to grow and be shaped in a controlled manner 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.390
 that's the approach of Powerboat a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.339
 The German architect earning cloud-ready was there from the start 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.830
 Since 2005, a team of architects in the South German city explores 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.590
 Stuttgart the conditions 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.770
 under which plants can become carriers of architecture 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
 They have called the research direction to Mohammed Harnik 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.330
 the construction companies Croydon where Barnett waived software cell 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.760
 an architectural enrichment is allowed on it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.880
 the federal court red materials like steel or concrete 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.320
 never given 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.710
 that can be 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 and of course it's the very good quality these trees have 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.770
 because the nation is experimenting forever 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.790
 his first projects are located south of Stuttgart to the Swiss border 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.180
 his promoter Michell plays Ford concept of overgrown wide 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.680
 Trees carried 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.160
 the faction becomes more and more stable over time 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.860
 are planned to carry the walk-in areas without help if the conditions 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.790
 vote 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.060
 the big challenges for the 30th 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.380
 That one when constructed with plants and trees both at the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 Construction as well as to the needs of the plants must lower 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.460
 So you have the light, for example, you have something special 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.140
 provide and can not just as in wood construction purely according to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 constructive aspects of the orderly design aspects 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.280
 also design his first run Botanical wise doesnt deserve 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.700
 planned here 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.380
 he has now transferred the experience from this project into the big one 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.860
 south of Stuttgart is currently the largest construction industry leaves 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.620
 Dr. Kathan Kubus of Nagold 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.830
 ten meters high 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.080
 100 square meters of floor space 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.540
 That will take about 20 years to remove the steel straps 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.640
 last 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.890
 until the presentation at the Landesgartenschau 2012 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.659
 should the little stars already be fused 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.959
 it is the beginning of the project 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.279
 it is planned that visitors walk in the middle of a lively building 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.750
 I would normally have to be surprised if I contract this for example 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.189
 cute parks will be quite nicely designed but that the most beautiful spaces he 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:32.799
 actually 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.260
 this one when looking at the trunk and son from the steadily up there are for 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.309
 me the treetops and the Nahrstedt had not opened up until today 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 the Austrian can search 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.810
 an example are the sketches of the German landscape architect Artur 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:52.379
 Wichniarek from the 1920s but the implementation fails 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.329
 a successful accusation 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.189
 the so-called dance 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.039
 they were already widespread in Europe in the Middle Ages 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.899
 a pavilion with a tree carried by the real ones of a linden tree 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 Meeting place for the village community 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.789
 The connection between nature and architecture is a topic for many builders 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.169
 from the elaborate facade greening 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.399
 same as living in your own tree house not more nature in the urban environment 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.589
 asked 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.789
 Berlin apn the span together with the architect Daniel SchÃ¼ler 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.610
 an essential aspect of new concepts 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.860
 Obotan's works are to become the green center of nine city districts 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.570
 the other aspect is around Dr 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.260
 and who private aspect 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.319
 that some of our urban development can think about the revolts 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.909
 Structures the Bauwut Amische structures in such a way to coordinate that 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.269
 possibly an apartment extension or extension of a studio 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.079
 or an office 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.120
 and the construction participate is possible and then comes not this topic of the 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:59.319
 Living in the treetop or working in the treetop reversed 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.359
 Also on the tables, of course, has something very atmospheric 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.249
 but also quite pragmatic reasons speak for building with plants 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.099
 and put them in the future also Siemens wants to become ever hotter prohibited 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.819
 unpleasant topic developed 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.110
 if you go in such a building that has its own 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.100
 Economic forecast otherwise creates an incredibly pleasant atmosphere 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.240
 otherwise you might agree with Wall Street as another advantage 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.480
 lies in the building 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.650
 In winter they leave room for more light and in the summer they greet 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.120
 in the middle of the city 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.810
