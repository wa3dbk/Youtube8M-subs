blade<00:00:04.680> mod<00:00:05.269> and<00:00:06.269> as<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> see<00:00:06.749> that's<00:00:06.930> already

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:07.169 
blade mod and as you see that's already

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.370 
blade mod and as you see that's already
taken<00:00:07.559> off<00:00:08.420> actually<00:00:09.420> come<00:00:09.780> off<00:00:09.810> fairly<00:00:10.140> easy

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
taken off actually come off fairly easy

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.230 
taken off actually come off fairly easy
with<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> hacksaw<00:00:13.580> but<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.730> problem<00:00:15.060> is<00:00:15.210> I

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
with a hacksaw but the problem is I

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.800 
with a hacksaw but the problem is I
couldn't<00:00:15.600> tape<00:00:15.930> all<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> because<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.690> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
couldn't tape all of it because this is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.990 
couldn't tape all of it because this is
what<00:00:18.960> I'm<00:00:19.050> doing<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:21.110> as<00:00:22.110> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.440> see<00:00:23.000> it's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what I'm doing it on as you can see it's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.510 
what I'm doing it on as you can see it's
hard<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.390> tape<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.650> work<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.160> something<00:00:26.369> like

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
hard to tape and work on something like

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.720 
hard to tape and work on something like
this<00:00:26.730> at<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> same<00:00:27.270> time<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.470> had<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> wait

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this at the same time so I had to wait

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.560 
this at the same time so I had to wait
but<00:00:30.690> the<00:00:31.610> throttle<00:00:32.610> blade<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.970> in<00:00:33.180> there<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
but the throttle blade is in there I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930 
but the throttle blade is in there I
actually<00:00:33.899> went<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.460> junkyards

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
actually went to one of the junkyards

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.020 
actually went to one of the junkyards
around<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.190> bought<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.220> throttle<00:00:38.790> blade

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
around here and bought a throttle blade

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.240 
around here and bought a throttle blade
for<00:00:39.360> five<00:00:39.570> bucks<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.770> case<00:00:40.950> anything

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
for five bucks so in case anything

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.560 
for five bucks so in case anything
happened<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.030> still<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> original

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
happened to it I still had the original

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.250 
happened to it I still had the original
which<00:00:43.380> is<00:00:43.410> over<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:45.980> there's<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> original

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
which is over here there's the original

00:00:48.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
which is over here there's the original
all<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> carbon<00:00:51.290> disgusting

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.630 

so<00:01:03.730> it's<00:01:04.629> done<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.380> yes<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.890> does<00:01:08.920> move<00:01:09.340> fairly

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
so it's done and yes it does move fairly

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.149 
so it's done and yes it does move fairly
quickly<00:01:10.000> now<00:01:10.330> it's<00:01:11.080> got<00:01:11.350> some<00:01:11.560> more<00:01:11.680> grunt<00:01:11.979> to

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
quickly now it's got some more grunt to

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:20.249 
quickly now it's got some more grunt to
it<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:18.759> real<00:01:19.149> hard<00:01:19.360> working<00:01:20.020> on<00:01:20.140> these

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
it it's just real hard working on these

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.210 
it it's just real hard working on these
bands<00:01:20.909> everything<00:01:21.909> is<00:01:22.060> stuffed<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.690> together

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
bands everything is stuffed in together

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
bands everything is stuffed in together
