00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello it's been a long time since I have not 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.790
 posted videos 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 I was asked a lot to talk about the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.429
 just to know how to sing more 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 just so here is a new small 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.890
 video talking about it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.580
 first of all as I say in my 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.130
 article on the website for 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.070
 to sing just to know well 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.830
 listen you have to focus you have to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.250
 listen to listen and not have 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.690
 problem of a museum music like 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.210
 arrhythmia these are deficiencies the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.489
 nobody hears well in music 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 she hears well but she does not arrive 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 to reproduce the sounds and she sings 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 false but really completely skewed 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.219
 by a little bit it's impossible 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.670
 for her to sing brother jacques by 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 example it's a little sad 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.230
 so now let's talk about something 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.110
 more cheerful people who are not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.220
 not reached damouzy they can 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.130
 work their accuracy by listening 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.439
 first and then singing so more one 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.979
 sing more , just sing more 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.560
 no longer listen have changed 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.470
 then you have to know that in singing 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 in in the field for example eastern 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.880
 there are quarter- tones that we 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 do not have in our pop music 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 but we still use it 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.290
 to say that for our our pieces 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.340
 are pretty and who is not 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 linear and and all right like as a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.140
 little choir field excuse me 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.119
 for choral songs for the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.119
 to make more beautiful we use precisely 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.540
 quarter tones and the middle of a 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.520
 note 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.009
 if we take a note like that so that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.939
 it's not the back and well then the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.100
 it's just to be spot here in the middle 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.920
 but you must know how to climb 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.039
 at the top of 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.780
 down at the bottom of the back so that can 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.640
 to be an exercise for example who you 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.739
 help in the rightness you take a 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.099
 note 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:26.080
 so I take a teenager I do not 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:28.300
 I am behind my back and 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.850
 now I climb to the top of the note 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.010
 and I go down the note 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.610
 all this to come back each time to 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.610
 simple to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750
 at 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.850
 1 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.230
 I came back here you can you 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.980
 have fun doing this on two three notes 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.660
 who are in your mediums so this 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.520
 commodity to the medium ie a place 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.200
 where it's nice for you to sing 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.660
 not too much not too serious either you 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.260
 make 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.240
 many times and each time 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.300
 you come back in the middle of the year 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.920
 so you really have to listen to the note goes up 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:20.580
 gently go down here I am you 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.830
 spoke earlier about the field of our 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.230
 pop music 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.610
 a little example I take lana del rey 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.860
 and video game 6 lana del rey sing 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.500
 video video games every time in spot 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.210
 in the middle of the note it would be very 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.840
 very linear right as in singing 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:46.260
 choral and that would do for example and everything 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:49.770
 and everything and old boys or so there is a 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.080
 little at school but she does not do that 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.680
 she makes an inflection of the voice this 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:05.430
 which makes their melody pretty so 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:07.200
 it's done and so it goes again so it goes up 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.060
 and it goes down that's why in 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.500
 our field in our modern music 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.100
 it's not always right 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.260
 it does not mean that it's wrong but 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.669
 but here it is more beautiful the ear or 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.940
 well that's another exercise for the 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.300
 correctness is to take for example the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.310
 major scale you start the range 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.950
 major for example I make you re mi 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.350
 So you have to know that the 3 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:47.870
 first notes so separate from one 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:50.490
 Golden tendon be but phase 1/2 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.390
 it's as if the birthrate on the side 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.390
 like that in two sets 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:09.629
 golden there we come back a note of a time 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.180
 and you give it to each person 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:15.210
 once you do the keyboard do re mi fa 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:27.150
 ground and you sing in spot so you 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:30.930
 can choose a a for example at 1/2 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.960
 attention here and every time you 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.150
 do well well one spot the other 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.560
 previous exercise that went up 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.430
 in the note and go down in the note 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.620
 This is another thing 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.300
 okay here after you can also 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.029
 take the same notes so brown them 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:54.629
 for example by reading with 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:57.419
 inflections but it must first have 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.430
 mastered C D E F floor spot at 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:03.930
 middle of the note to do that 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:07.110
 so last great exercise that we 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.319
 let's do it every time this is the 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.789
 work of the manceaux a capella so we 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:17.099
 take a piece we learn the melody 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.440
 so the piece with the intruder with the 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.690
 instruments are betting the a capella epa with 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.300
 so an artist that you like you 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:28.229
 learn the melody is where it should be 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.349
 reproduce a capella you can listen 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.490
 the beginning when will see the note and 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.759
 to know in which direction 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.169
 start and after hop we stop like 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.699
 you know the melody you have to 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.759
 to be able to sing it normally 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.199
 capella the worry is that there you 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.270
 may not necessarily hear 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.500
 that you do need to be here there are some 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.210
 people who hear very well when they 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.270
 search people who do not hear 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.570
 because his request 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:58.460
 really a discipline of the ear and 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:07:00.680
 a habit and here are the exercises a 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.190
 aptitude also so that's why 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.370
 that some need teachers 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.500
 voice or voice coach that's when 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.790
 others do not need it 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.950
 so here's the teacher he's here to 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.130
 guide and to say when it's wrong 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:19.280
 not and to steer to correct that's it 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:22.550
 I hope that it will help you 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.750
 I stop talking so think about notes 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:30.170
 to be in spots and I go up and down 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:34.360
 and I'm coming back to the center this is a 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.360
 next time and sing well
