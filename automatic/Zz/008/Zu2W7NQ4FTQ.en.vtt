00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
from that musically that's the the gist

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.859 
from that musically that's the the gist
of<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:15.049> for<00:01:16.049> me

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
of it for me

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
of it for me
it's<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.200> changed<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.640> notebooks

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's it's changed from just notebooks

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's it's changed from just notebooks
and<00:01:21.540> notebooks<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.080> lyric<00:01:22.380> ideas<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and notebooks of lyric ideas and then I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.660 
and notebooks of lyric ideas and then I
would<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.240> songs<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.549> assemble<00:01:26.549> them

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
would just make songs and assemble them

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.630 
would just make songs and assemble them
based<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.150> these<00:01:27.360> prior<00:01:28.200> ideas<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
based on these prior ideas and then I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
based on these prior ideas and then I
realized<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> songs<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:31.079> don't

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
realized that the songs really don't

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.679 
realized that the songs really don't
have<00:01:31.770> much<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.490> identity<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
have much of an identity that way it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.060 
have much of an identity that way it
doesn't<00:01:34.079> say<00:01:34.290> something<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> beginning

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
doesn't say something at the beginning

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.690 
doesn't say something at the beginning
and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.850> finish<00:01:36.829> it's<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.400> bunch<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and then finish it's just a bunch of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
and then finish it's just a bunch of
random<00:01:39.119> stuff<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.020> I've<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.710> been<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
random stuff so I've that's been a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.080 
random stuff so I've that's been a
really<00:01:41.659> important<00:01:42.659> part<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> try<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
really important part of what I try to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
really important part of what I try to
instill<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.079> lyric<00:01:46.590> creation<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:50.040> a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.899 
full but anymore I those are just kind
of<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> sort<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.110> base<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.100> everything

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
of a sort of base and then everything

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.899 
of a sort of base and then everything
else<00:02:03.469> works<00:02:04.469> harder<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> compliment<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
else works harder to compliment the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
else works harder to compliment the
music<00:02:06.360> rather<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.920> clashing<00:02:07.920> which<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.220> think

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
music rather than clashing which I think

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.270 
music rather than clashing which I think
our<00:02:08.520> earlier<00:02:09.179> earlier<00:02:09.959> material<00:02:10.349> did

our earlier earlier material did

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.220 
our earlier earlier material did
I<00:02:11.400> feel<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.300> exhausting<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I feel that it's so exhausting and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.340 
I feel that it's so exhausting and
monotonous<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:16.020> know<00:02:16.050> the

monotonous to be like the you know the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.830 
monotonous to be like the you know the
cliche<00:02:16.950> metalcore<00:02:17.459> set<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.150> lyrics<00:02:18.390> this

important part in making lyrics and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.220 
important part in making lyrics and
doing<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.610> over<00:02:32.790> top<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.360> such<00:02:33.720> aggressive

still not I was more visually obnoxious
which<00:07:16.199> is<00:07:16.319> something<00:07:16.529> I<00:07:16.770> regret

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:17.159 
which is something I regret

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:19.490 
which is something I regret
I<00:07:17.400> wish<00:07:17.969> someone<00:07:18.150> had<00:07:18.330> told<00:07:18.360> me<00:07:18.599> write<00:07:19.169> songs

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.360 
I wish someone had told me write songs
better<00:07:19.889> and<00:07:20.340> don't<00:07:20.669> dress<00:07:21.000> like<00:07:21.029> a

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
better and don't dress like a

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.990 
better and don't dress like a
teenybopper

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.179 

but<00:07:27.000> I<00:07:27.029> think<00:07:27.569> a<00:07:27.659> lot<00:07:28.020> of<00:07:28.080> it<00:07:28.289> I<00:07:28.319> think<00:07:28.949> I<00:07:29.009> could

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:29.189 
but I think a lot of it I think I could

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:30.469 
but I think a lot of it I think I could
have<00:07:29.279> forgiven<00:07:29.580> myself<00:07:29.819> a<00:07:30.120> little<00:07:30.270> bit<00:07:30.419> more

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
have forgiven myself a little bit more

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.170 
have forgiven myself a little bit more
often<00:07:31.020> and<00:07:31.319> I<00:07:32.159> give<00:07:32.430> him<00:07:32.490> myself<00:07:32.849> a<00:07:32.939> little

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
often and I give him myself a little

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.959 
often and I give him myself a little
more<00:07:33.330> slack<00:07:33.599> and<00:07:33.930> I<00:07:33.990> like<00:07:34.310> while<00:07:35.310> I<00:07:35.339> think<00:07:35.819> that

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:35.969 
more slack and I like while I think that

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:39.679 
more slack and I like while I think that
helps<00:07:36.330> too<00:07:37.189> for<00:07:38.189> a<00:07:38.219> creative<00:07:38.849> individual<00:07:39.389> to

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:39.689 
helps too for a creative individual to

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.709 
helps too for a creative individual to
progress<00:07:40.110> and<00:07:40.409> to<00:07:40.620> not<00:07:40.800> be<00:07:40.979> complacent<00:07:41.719> I

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:42.719 
progress and to not be complacent I

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:44.589 
progress and to not be complacent I
think<00:07:43.469> I<00:07:43.500> would<00:07:43.680> have<00:07:43.740> had<00:07:43.919> a<00:07:43.949> better<00:07:44.189> time

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 
think I would have had a better time

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:48.399 
think I would have had a better time
being<00:07:45.599> in<00:07:45.779> this<00:07:45.899> band<00:07:46.139> if<00:07:46.349> I<00:07:46.439> weren't<00:07:46.649> so<00:07:46.800> like

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 
harshly critical I don't think that

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.019 
harshly critical I don't think that
