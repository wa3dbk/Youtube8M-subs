00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
breaking with the windows tradition I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.930 
breaking with the windows tradition I
think<00:01:03.920> people<00:01:04.130> have<00:01:04.190> been<00:01:04.339> calling<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:04.730> for

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
think people have been calling this for

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.780 
think people have been calling this for
quite<00:01:05.150> some<00:01:05.480> time<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.770> can<00:01:07.070> only<00:01:07.190> hang<00:01:07.460> on<00:01:07.610> to

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
quite some time you can only hang on to

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.540 
quite some time you can only hang on to
that<00:01:07.910> for<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:08.420> long<00:01:08.660> I<00:01:09.080> like<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:09.979> move<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.340> lot

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
that for so long I like this move a lot

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.520 
that for so long I like this move a lot
I<00:01:10.820> think<00:01:11.090> we're<00:01:11.660> looking<00:01:11.900> probably<00:01:12.080> at<00:01:12.440> a

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
I think we're looking probably at a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.000 
I think we're looking probably at a
billion<00:01:12.800> plus<00:01:13.430> in<00:01:13.850> revenue<00:01:14.619> also<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.650> win<00:01:15.890> for

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
billion plus in revenue also a win for

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.010 
billion plus in revenue also a win for
Apple<00:01:16.369> who<00:01:16.670> gets<00:01:17.180> thirty<00:01:17.479> percent<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.960> that

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
Apple who gets thirty percent of that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.690 
Apple who gets thirty percent of that
nice<00:01:18.650> little<00:01:19.100> when<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:19.369> through<00:01:19.580> the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
nice little when it's through the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.090 
nice little when it's through the
app<00:01:19.850> store<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.530> think<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:21.860> is<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.070> first

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
app store so I think this is the first

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.800 
app store so I think this is the first
of<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.610> lot<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.970> things<00:01:23.119> we're<00:01:23.390> going<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.570> see

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
of a lot of things we're going to see

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.690 
of a lot of things we're going to see
out<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.050> Microsoft<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.979> breaks<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.460> kind

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
out of Microsoft that breaks that kind

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.640 
out of Microsoft that breaks that kind
of<00:01:25.760> Windows<00:01:26.180> mold<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:26.930> like<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.290> do<00:01:27.560> you

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
of Windows mold and I like it do you

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.040 
of Windows mold and I like it do you
think<00:01:27.830> part<00:01:28.160> of<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.580> movement<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.750> stock

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
think part of the movement in the stock

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.870 
think part of the movement in the stock
today<00:01:30.350> has<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.009> do<00:01:31.100> with<00:01:31.280> at<00:01:31.460> least<00:01:31.610> some

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
today has to do with at least some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.109 
today has to do with at least some
people<00:01:32.210> saying<00:01:32.450> this<00:01:33.130> means<00:01:34.130> we're<00:01:34.610> not<00:01:34.640> going

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
people saying this means we're not going

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.570 
people saying this means we're not going
to<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:35.360> any<00:01:35.509> more<00:01:35.690> hardware<00:01:36.140> were<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:37.460> is

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
to have any more hardware were this is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.090 
to have any more hardware were this is
the<00:01:37.729> end<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> surface<00:01:38.509> tablet<00:01:39.020> well<00:01:39.890> it

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
the end of the surface tablet well it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.620 
the end of the surface tablet well it
was<00:01:40.310> interesting<00:01:40.340> during<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.119> demo<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.539> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
was interesting during the demo in the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.010 
was interesting during the demo in the
presentation<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:43.369> office<00:01:43.789> app<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
presentation of the office app the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.810 
presentation of the office app the
surface<00:01:45.380> was<00:01:45.530> nowhere<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.830> be<00:01:46.009> found<00:01:46.310> we<00:01:46.640> saw

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
surface was nowhere to be found we saw

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.380 
surface was nowhere to be found we saw
iPads<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:47.570> saw<00:01:47.720> some<00:01:47.899> Android<00:01:48.429> devices<00:01:49.429> so<00:01:50.360> I

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
iPads we saw some Android devices so I

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.389 
iPads we saw some Android devices so I
think<00:01:50.569> probably<00:01:51.110> people<00:01:51.740> are<00:01:51.830> saying<00:01:52.039> that

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
think probably people are saying that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.389 
think probably people are saying that
clearly<00:01:52.759> wasn't<00:01:53.060> working<00:01:53.679> bombers<00:01:54.679> out<00:01:54.920> Gates

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
clearly wasn't working bombers out Gates

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.510 
clearly wasn't working bombers out Gates
