00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
three years ago and I remember how I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.429 
three years ago and I remember how I
grieved<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.210> very<00:01:18.420> unexpected<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:19.320> was

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
grieved it was very unexpected it was

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.300 
grieved it was very unexpected it was
very<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.830> quiet<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> didn't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
very very quiet and and then it didn't

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.170 
very very quiet and and then it didn't
come<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.630> its<00:01:25.259> full<00:01:25.590> force<00:01:25.979> until<00:01:26.490> maybe<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
come to its full force until maybe a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
come to its full force until maybe a
year<00:01:27.450> later<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:28.920> much

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
year later and I think that that's much

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.950 
year later and I think that that's much
more<00:01:29.430> honest<00:01:30.110> but<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.710> movie<00:01:32.659> not<00:01:33.659> only

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
more honest but in this movie not only

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
more honest but in this movie not only
dealing<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> death<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.100> child<00:01:35.130> but

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
dealing with a death of a child but

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
dealing with a death of a child but
dealing<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.119> death<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.600> child<00:01:36.930> who<00:01:37.110> has

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
dealing with a death of a child who has

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
dealing with a death of a child who has
taken<00:01:37.650> their<00:01:37.890> life<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.299> why

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
taken their life and you don't know why

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.429 
taken their life and you don't know why
that's<00:01:40.409> even<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.400> over<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.110> really

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that's even more of a over of a really

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.810 
that's even more of a over of a really
hard<00:01:44.390> emotion<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.600> express<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> easy<00:01:47.430> way

hard emotion to express and the easy way

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.080 
hard emotion to express and the easy way
is<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.600> melodramatic<00:01:49.790> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.909> that's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
is to be melodramatic you know that's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
is to be melodramatic you know that's
the<00:01:51.210> easy<00:01:51.390> way<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.320> wanted<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> get
