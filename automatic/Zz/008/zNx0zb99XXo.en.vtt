00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.670 

I<00:03:25.790> need<00:03:26.330> some<00:03:26.510> time<00:03:26.750> really<00:03:26.930> just<00:03:27.260> itself

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
I need some time really just itself

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.760 
I need some time really just itself
apparently<00:03:28.250> all<00:03:28.430> right<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.290> pretty<00:03:30.290> much<00:03:30.560> what

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
apparently all right so pretty much what

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.410 
apparently all right so pretty much what
I<00:03:30.830> went<00:03:31.070> with<00:03:31.310> was<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:32.090> garnet<00:03:32.990> red<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.910> hit

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
I went with was a garnet red and I hit

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.420 
I went with was a garnet red and I hit
the<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.990> think<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.320> was<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.530> Ma<00:03:36.680> Tei<00:03:36.950> color

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the I think it was the Ma Tei color

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.610 
the I think it was the Ma Tei color
primary<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.210> after<00:03:38.960> that<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.140> hit<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.350> with<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
primary and after that I hit it with the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.100 
primary and after that I hit it with the
pearlescent<00:03:40.280> yellow<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:41.780> that's<00:03:41.930> why<00:03:42.020> it

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
pearlescent yellow so that's why it

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.750 
pearlescent yellow so that's why it
looks<00:03:42.290> kind<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.560> like<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.890> changing<00:03:43.400> colors

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
looks kind of like it's changing colors

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.610 
looks kind of like it's changing colors
