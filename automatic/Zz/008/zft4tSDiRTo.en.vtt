reindeer we're going to start off by
drawing<00:00:08.309> an<00:00:08.730> oval<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.450> his<00:00:09.570> head<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.309> he<00:00:11.309> has

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
drawing an oval for his head and he has

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.039 
drawing an oval for his head and he has
his<00:00:11.670> head<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.030> turned<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.420> bit<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> side

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
his head just turned a bit to the side

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.369 
his head just turned a bit to the side
so<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> oval<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.250> leaned<00:00:14.639> over<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:16.230> then

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
so the oval is leaned over and then

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.470 
so the oval is leaned over and then
we'll<00:00:16.529> draw<00:00:16.740> another<00:00:17.190> oval<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:18.150> his<00:00:18.300> snout

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
we'll draw another oval for his snout

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.920 
we'll draw another oval for his snout
and<00:00:21.920> then<00:00:22.920> his<00:00:23.039> ears<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:24.210> sticking<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
curved lines that go up from his head

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.810 
curved lines that go up from his head
and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.520> short<00:00:35.969> lines<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.930> two<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> them

that go out away from the main line his
eyes<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:43.140> round<00:00:43.469> circles<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.930> then<00:00:45.930> his<00:00:46.140> nose

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
is an oval good now his legs we're gonna

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
is an oval good now his legs we're gonna
start<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.840> his<00:00:54.989> chin<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.649> they're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
start just here at his chin and they're

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240 
start just here at his chin and they're
going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.250> used<00:00:56.789> big<00:00:57.239> long<00:00:57.510> use<00:00:58.010> that<00:00:59.010> come

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
going to be used big long use that come

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.180 
going to be used big long use that come
down<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.820> his<00:01:00.210> chin<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.859> we'll<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
down from his chin and then we'll make a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.410 
down from his chin and then we'll make a
line<00:01:02.489> across<00:01:02.820> where<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.719> hoofs<00:01:04.049> begin<00:01:05.420> now

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
line across where his hoofs begin now

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.490 
line across where his hoofs begin now
here<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.240 

and<00:01:09.800> then<00:01:10.580> there's<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.660> rest<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.230> and<00:01:12.530> then

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
and then there's the rest of it and then

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.720 
and then there's the rest of it and then
from<00:01:13.490> here<00:01:13.730> we'll<00:01:13.910> make<00:01:14.120> his<00:01:14.420> last<00:01:15.340> leg<00:01:16.340> and

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
from here we'll make his last leg and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.880 
from here we'll make his last leg and
his<00:01:17.480> rump<00:01:19.270> great<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.740> has<00:01:21.860> a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
his rump great and then it just has a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.290 
his rump great and then it just has a
little<00:01:22.220> tail<00:01:22.460> peeking<00:01:22.940> out<00:01:23.060> back<00:01:23.360> here<00:01:25.300> and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
little tail peeking out back here and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.700 
little tail peeking out back here and
then<00:01:26.420> we'll<00:01:26.540> draw<00:01:26.720> straight<00:01:27.080> lines<00:01:27.380> going

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
then we'll draw straight lines going

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.240 
then we'll draw straight lines going
down<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.190> show<00:01:28.400> where<00:01:28.580> his<00:01:28.760> hoofs<00:01:29.350> divide<00:01:30.880> okay

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
down to show where his hoofs divide okay

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.550 
down to show where his hoofs divide okay
go<00:01:34.250> over<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.670> lines<00:01:34.910> for<00:01:35.330> his<00:01:35.450> antlers<00:01:35.900> by

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
go over the lines for his antlers by

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.400 
go over the lines for his antlers by
making<00:01:37.040> tracing<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:38.300> beside<00:01:38.690> them<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.200> make

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
making tracing just beside them to make

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.040 
making tracing just beside them to make
it<00:01:39.560> thicker<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.630> we'll<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:41.810> something

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
it thicker so that we'll have something

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.800 
it thicker so that we'll have something
to<00:01:42.229> color<00:01:42.590> in<00:01:43.270> when<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:44.450> get<00:01:44.630> up<00:01:44.810> there

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
to color in when we get up there

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.080 
to color in when we get up there
so<00:01:47.810> just<00:01:48.020> trace<00:01:48.350> along<00:01:48.530> parallel<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.850> lines

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
so just trace along parallel to lines

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.910 
so just trace along parallel to lines
you<00:01:50.270> drew<00:01:50.479> already<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.020> curve<00:01:51.410> them<00:01:51.619> at<00:01:51.770> the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
you drew already and curve them at the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.120 
you drew already and curve them at the
ends<00:01:52.340> all<00:01:53.210> right<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.660> have<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.840> look<00:01:54.110> at<00:01:54.920> what

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
ends all right so have a look at what

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.540 
ends all right so have a look at what
you've<00:01:55.280> done<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.820> far<00:01:57.070> see<00:01:58.070> if<00:01:58.160> it<00:01:58.250> looks<00:01:58.400> like

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
you've done so far see if it looks like

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.400 
you've done so far see if it looks like
what<00:01:58.820> I've<00:01:58.940> done<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.540> pause<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.140> video

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
what I've done you can pause the video

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.010 
what I've done you can pause the video
if<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:02.090> all<00:02:02.330> we<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.780> do<00:02:02.900> is

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
if you like and all we have to do is

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.350 
if you like and all we have to do is
just<00:02:03.200> erase<00:02:03.650> this<00:02:03.950> little<00:02:04.340> bit<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.030> first

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
just erase this little bit of the first

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320 
just erase this little bit of the first
oval<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:05.900> drew<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:07.160> then<00:02:07.280> we<00:02:07.369> can<00:02:07.550> trace<00:02:07.820> over

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
oval we drew and then we can trace over

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.570 
oval we drew and then we can trace over
all<00:02:08.570> of<00:02:08.959> our<00:02:09.250> lines<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.820> there's<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.690> smile

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
all of our lines and there's a smile

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.400 
all of our lines and there's a smile
okay<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:14.000> your<00:02:14.150> black<00:02:14.360> marker<00:02:14.870> now<00:02:15.019> let's

okay so with your black marker now let's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.920 
okay so with your black marker now let's
trace<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.519> outline<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.540> everything

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
trace over the outline of everything

00:02:17.930 --> 00:03:00.670 
trace over the outline of everything
that<00:02:18.320> we<00:02:18.470> just<00:02:18.769> drew

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.530
