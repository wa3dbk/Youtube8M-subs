00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.330
 I could not think of any joke but 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.330
 beginning of this video 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.770
 do not 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.700
 iron man 3 so iron man 3 the first 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.420
 movie of phase 2 of the universe 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 marvel 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 and I do not have to say that I had so many 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.130
 I want to see iron man 3 and I do not have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.169
 either what to ask them if they want to see 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.420
 iron man 3 because I know the answer is 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.619
 yes it is and as with the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.739
 Avengers was incredibly 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.900
 excited the fever the day of premiere 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.900
 that is , the 3 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.540
 incredibly bear 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.470
 so let's go a little more in detail 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.300
 with iron and starting with the address 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.260
 that as you probably know it's not me 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.750
 please the director this time skin and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.059
 although they still only leave hair that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.159
 enough of his part jean black director 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 of kiss kiss bang bang the video is x mi 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.700
 excellent work with that of montreal and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.190
 it shows because everything is pretty 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 different German 1 and brother 2 and I 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.250
 loved because he manages to find the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 perfect balance between a story being 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.610
 and staff for tony stark while 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.560
 he left the character of iron man 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.289
 completely intact the humor 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.190
 personality and bullets serve is always 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.320
 good to see when someone cares 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.210
 really an action movie is about 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 to make them a little bit more than ever 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.390
 it hurts now going to the acting 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.950
 we have robert downey junior who has 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.690
 born to do this role 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.979
 he is always great so I would like 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.899
 concentrate a little more on the new 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.700
 cast more than we already know if 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.800
 we want to start not because of the unique 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.050
 unparalleled ben kingsley plays 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.840
 mandarin that my opinion the best villain 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.299
 they burned it has had some 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.619
 fantastic teams in attitude of 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 presentation that we're only going to be with 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.789
 these as videos as terrorist type 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 fantastic and it's hard to talk about this 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.740
 character without explaining the whole movie 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 which by the way are not safe 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 combined public because it is difficult 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 talk about your character without spoiling what 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.960
 everything but let's say it's viviana 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.940
 favorite of any movie the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.040
 cinematic universe of the sea and also what 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.170
 that will highlight what it's called 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.770
 guy pearce 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.770
 and they lived 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.260
 of everyone in the new cast he was my 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.300
 favorite a Ghanaian up there so that there 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.240
 peaks in the technical aspects like 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.680
 It usually happens with these movies 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.580
 huge budget the sound and the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.580
 special effects are 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.620
 nothing to say and diameter I wanted 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.840
 leave it at the end the script written by 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.489
 simple other people whose name the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.200
 memories 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.000
 as I said this movie is much more 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.739
 mature that iron man iron man do we late 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.170
 even you thinkers and any of 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.870
 sides of the sea kinematics I missed the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.410
 bullet an animal its medium 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.060
 but 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.130
 and I think that's largely due to 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.770
 script of this movie that is much more 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.950
 staff is much more intimate with tony 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.170
 star than any of the above 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.430
 iron 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 something they tried to do in iron man 2 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.870
 but they failed here they succeed 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.520
 perfectly because tourists not only 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.200
 must face Mandarin also 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.670
 must confront himself in the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.960
 structure is quite similar although not 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.150
 want to compare them with this movie 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.620
 although technically could more are 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.420
 end of a trilogy of superheroes 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.400
 there is gentleman of the night being both 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.530
 Characters do not part of their better state 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.290
 At the beginning of the movie , 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.810
 this terrorist force that destroys them 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.430
 completely and must ascend by itself 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.750
 themselves so I would say that at least in 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.060
 the first half more movies are 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.680
 They look pretty but new keeping 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.750
 intact from sight that remains 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.580
 Sarcastic remains incredibly 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.200
 funny but feels more empathy with the 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.910
 almond I felt it in this now I 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.580
 love to say that there is a mantra is 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.700
 perfect but it is not at least in my 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.070
 opinion the rare art movie the edition 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.840
 it's a bit strange the ring is like the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.550
 principle is like a runner who 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.170
 stumbles when it comes out of the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.170
 starting but eventually it gets better and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.469
 a motivating story 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.150
 I also like that trailers do not 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.340
 they will show absolutely everything there is a whole 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.930
 side of this movie that is 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.060
 completely omitted from the trailers 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 so there are seasons that's why the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.750
 Attractions are great as always 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.520
 I also really like the fact that 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.570
 bring the clause the trilogy is not only 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.910
 as the term and that shows that as 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.310
 that you follow those things on the circuit and 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.229
 at the end of the day ironman treces aus 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.120
 much more serious than the previous ones not to 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.440
 level of batman what I liked too 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.750
 because it still maintains the spirit 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.910
 happy and great that in the movies of 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 I'm going to give iron man 3 a la 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.349
 would give it back in cinemas that of course 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.860
 I'll be later but to see it from 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.860
 new is 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.940
 do it 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.520
 maybe not as exact as the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.220
 avengers but pretty close to what 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.630
 it is already an enormous merit to achieve in a 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.960
 week more I do not have the criticism of in 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.520
 trance the new movie by danny boyle 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.250
 follow and this week's tri question 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.600
 but he is back after his 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.520
 vacation with the house 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.230
 is back in all the movies 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 that come in the climatic universe 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.190
 from marvel which is the one that is most 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.750
 waiting without buying avengers 2 in 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.490
 all movies that have come out of 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.160
 marvel cinematic universe what is your 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.860
 favorite without counting the avengers is no 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.380
 account and finally what did you think 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 keep and my blue answer encourage 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.810
 because we have seen those characters more 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.970
 that nothing and the cap riders awesome iron 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.550
 man 3 in fact followed by iron man and 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.470
 for that answer go back to the second 0 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.300
