so<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.860> just<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> be<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> quick

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so this is just going to be a quick

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.579 
so this is just going to be a quick
simple<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.330> fun<00:00:03.600> tutorial<00:00:03.810> we're<00:00:04.440> going<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
simple and fun tutorial we're going to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.460 
simple and fun tutorial we're going to
create<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:05.130> rolling<00:00:05.460> carpet<00:00:06.120> animation<00:00:06.660> and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
create this rolling carpet animation and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.259 
create this rolling carpet animation and
we<00:00:07.770> can<00:00:07.919> actually<00:00:08.040> achieve<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.820> simply

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
we can actually achieve this very simply

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.730 
we can actually achieve this very simply
using<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.809> cube<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.889> bend<00:00:11.130> modifier<00:00:12.740> so

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
using a cube and the bend modifier so

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.230 
using a cube and the bend modifier so
I'm<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.130> start<00:00:14.340> by<00:00:14.460> creating<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.940> cube

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
I'm going to start by creating a cube

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.060 
I'm going to start by creating a cube
and<00:00:15.770> I'm<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.890> going<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.130> adjust<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and I'm just going to adjust the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.420 
and I'm just going to adjust the
manipulation<00:00:20.760> handles<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:22.189> just<00:00:23.189> trying<00:00:23.340> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
manipulation handles here just trying to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.370 
manipulation handles here just trying to
grab<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.699> orange<00:00:24.090> point<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:25.289> adjust

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
grab this orange point here to adjust

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.740 
grab this orange point here to adjust
the<00:00:25.680> height<00:00:27.470> but<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> axis<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> way

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.160 

I'm<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> adjust<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> length<00:00:36.170> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
I'm just going to adjust the length and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
I'm just going to adjust the length and
I'm<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> go<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> display<00:00:38.670> gold<00:00:39.300> shading

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
I'm going to go to display gold shading

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
I'm going to go to display gold shading
lines<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> size<00:00:41.820> Y<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.590> it's<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> piece<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
lines so the size Y and it's a piece of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
lines so the size Y and it's a piece of
carpet<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.629> quite<00:00:45.809> thin

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
carpet so it's going to be quite thin

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.940 
carpet so it's going to be quite thin
and<00:00:46.379> maybe<00:00:47.190> even<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.670> centimeters<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.950> I'm

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and maybe even one centimeters and I'm

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740 
and maybe even one centimeters and I'm
going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> add<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.550> cross<00:00:51.030> sections<00:00:51.510> into

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
going to add some cross sections into

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.799 
going to add some cross sections into
this<00:00:52.550> not<00:00:53.550> alone<00:00:53.789> Y<00:00:54.350> but<00:00:55.350> along<00:00:55.649> Z<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.399> this

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
this not alone Y but along Z like this

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
this not alone Y but along Z like this
because<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.020> basically<00:00:58.289> rolling<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.160> we

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
because it's basically rolling out so we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.479 
because it's basically rolling out so we
need<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> cross<00:00:59.940> sections<00:01:00.390> along<00:01:01.170> Z<00:01:01.500> I'm

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
need a lot of cross sections along Z I'm

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.799 
need a lot of cross sections along Z I'm
not<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> start<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.270> quite<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> high

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
not going to start with quite a high

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.130 
not going to start with quite a high
number<00:01:03.870> maybe<00:01:04.470> 200<00:01:08.720> next<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
number maybe 200 next I'm going to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.940 
number maybe 200 next I'm going to
create<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.680> bend<00:01:10.950> modifier<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
create a bend modifier and I'm going to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.390 
create a bend modifier and I'm going to
make<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> child<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> cube<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:17.280> just

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
make this a child of the cube I'm just

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.499 
make this a child of the cube I'm just
going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> call<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> cube<00:01:18.119> carpet<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> I'm

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
going to call the cube carpet so I'm

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
going to call the cube carpet so I'm
going<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.689> click<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> bend<00:01:22.350> modifier<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
going to click on the bend modifier and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.440 
going to click on the bend modifier and
I'm<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> choose<00:01:24.570> fit<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.290> parent<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I'm going to choose fit to parent so it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
I'm going to choose fit to parent so it
basically<00:01:27.750> makes<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> exact<00:01:28.680> same<00:01:28.890> size

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
basically makes it the exact same size

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
basically makes it the exact same size
as<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.689> carpet<00:01:31.049> cube<00:01:31.470> object<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:33.960> just

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
as the carpet cube object so I'm just

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
as the carpet cube object so I'm just
going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> adjust<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> strength<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:36.090> can

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
going to adjust the strength and you can

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.590 
going to adjust the strength and you can
see<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.509> bending<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> wrong<00:01:37.140> way<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> need

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
see it's bending the wrong way so I need

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.399 
see it's bending the wrong way so I need
to<00:01:39.720> rotate<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.409> maybe<00:01:41.600> 90<00:01:42.600> degrees<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.140> way

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to rotate this maybe 90 degrees this way

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.980 
to rotate this maybe 90 degrees this way
and<00:01:43.970> then<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> click<00:01:45.420> fit<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and then I'm going to click fit the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.200 
and then I'm going to click fit the
parent<00:01:46.320> again<00:01:46.590> increase<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> strength<00:01:48.060> again

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
parent again increase the strength again

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.620 
parent again increase the strength again
and<00:01:51.170> think<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.290> need<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> rotate<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> again<00:01:53.630> 90

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and think we need to rotate it again 90

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.929 
and think we need to rotate it again 90
degrees<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.790> set<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> parent<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:58.939> this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
degrees this way set the parent and this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.260 
degrees this way set the parent and this
is<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> direction<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> bend<00:02:01.920> them

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
is the direction I want it to bend them

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
is the direction I want it to bend them
so<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.420> keep<00:02:03.600> rotating<00:02:03.780> 90<00:02:04.290> degrees<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
so just keep rotating 90 degrees and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.649 
so just keep rotating 90 degrees and
clicking<00:02:05.369> fit<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> parent<00:02:06.060> until<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
clicking fit to parent until you get the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.820 
clicking fit to parent until you get the
correct<00:02:06.899> direction<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.080> is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
correct direction now this is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.880 
correct direction now this is
too<00:02:11.820> long<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.770> adjust<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
too long so I'm just going to adjust the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.620 
too long so I'm just going to adjust the
size<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.550> span<00:02:17.760> modifier<00:02:18.240> we<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.540> adjust

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
size of the span modifier we can adjust

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.010 
size of the span modifier we can adjust
it<00:02:18.960> here<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.570> going<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> bring<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it here and I'm just going to bring it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.070 
it here and I'm just going to bring it
to<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.200> edge<00:02:22.350> here<00:02:23.750> we're<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> adjust

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to the edge here we're going to adjust

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.740 
to the edge here we're going to adjust
strength<00:02:25.410> again<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.420> pretty<00:02:27.660> much

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
strength again and this is pretty much

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.440 
strength again and this is pretty much
the<00:02:27.900> effect<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.680> want<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.180> actually

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the effect we want so I can actually

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.880 
the effect we want so I can actually
bend<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.990> all<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.200> way<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
bend it all the way back like this and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.880 
bend it all the way back like this and
then<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:36.060> actually<00:02:36.560> move<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.830> bend<00:02:39.890> back

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
then I can actually move the bend back

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.780 
then I can actually move the bend back
to<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.160> beginning<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.580> kind<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
to the beginning and we get this kind of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.860 
to the beginning and we get this kind of
strange<00:02:48.500> get<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> strange<00:02:49.950> effect<00:02:50.870> basically

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
strange get a strange effect basically

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.090 
strange get a strange effect basically
what<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.080> want<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.500> click<00:02:52.740> fit<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
what you want to do is click fit to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.800 
what you want to do is click fit to
parent<00:02:53.400> again<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:59.180> now<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.570> could<00:03:00.690> actually

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
parent again and now we could actually

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.020 
parent again and now we could actually
roll<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.380> out<00:03:03.860> which<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.250> cool<00:03:05.750> so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
roll this out which is really cool so

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.860 
roll this out which is really cool so
I'm<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.390> go<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> my<00:03:09.720> side<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:09.990> you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
I'm just going to go to my side of you

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.860 
I'm just going to go to my side of you
just<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> see<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> cross-section<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.920> this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.390 

so<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.380> go<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.860> see<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.250> we

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so here we go so we can see that we

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.880 
so here we go so we can see that we
don't<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:23.790> enough<00:03:24.150> cross-sections<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:25.739> need

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
don't have enough cross-sections we need

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.890 
don't have enough cross-sections we need
actually<00:03:26.190> quite<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> few<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:27.750> going<00:03:27.870> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
actually quite a few so I'm going to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.090 
actually quite a few so I'm going to
increase<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> cross<00:03:28.830> sections<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.310> 400<00:03:31.100> sorry

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
increase the cross sections to 400 sorry

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.850 
increase the cross sections to 400 sorry
it's<00:03:32.940> actually<00:03:33.060> displaying<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.650> quite

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
it's actually displaying this is quite

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.979 
it's actually displaying this is quite
annoying<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:35.790> displaying<00:03:36.209> lines<00:03:36.540> which

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
annoying it's displaying lines which

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.540 
annoying it's displaying lines which
isn't<00:03:37.170> actually<00:03:37.500> polygons<00:03:37.980> if<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.310> click

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
isn't actually polygons if I click

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.530 
isn't actually polygons if I click
wireframe<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.989> we're<00:03:40.140> getting<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.380> accurate

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
wireframe now we're getting the accurate

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.250 
wireframe now we're getting the accurate
kind<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.600> slice<00:03:43.050> count<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.010> 200<00:03:44.640> was<00:03:44.790> actually

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
kind of slice count so 200 was actually

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.550 
kind of slice count so 200 was actually
okay<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:47.160> seems<00:03:47.280> kind<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.640> detailed<00:03:48.150> enough

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
okay it seems kind of detailed enough

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.890 
okay it seems kind of detailed enough
now<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:49.769> thing<00:03:49.950> you'll<00:03:50.130> notice<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.900> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
now one thing you'll notice is the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.840 
now one thing you'll notice is the
carpet<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.410> basically<00:03:52.680> intersecting<00:03:53.489> itself

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
carpet is basically intersecting itself

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.020 
carpet is basically intersecting itself
and<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.720> should<00:03:54.900> be<00:03:55.019> kind<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.350> more<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:56.030> helix

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
and it should be kind of more of a helix

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.509 
and it should be kind of more of a helix
effect<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.739> I'll<00:03:58.739> actually<00:03:58.890> already<00:03:59.250> figured

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
effect so I'll actually already figured

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.190 
effect so I'll actually already figured
out<00:03:59.640> how<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.910> do<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.269> I'm<00:04:00.480> not<00:04:00.780> sure<00:04:00.959> why<00:04:01.140> it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
out how to do this I'm not sure why it

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.900 
out how to do this I'm not sure why it
works<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:01.769> basically<00:04:02.040> if<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.580> go<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
works but basically if you go to the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.000 
works but basically if you go to the
coordinates<00:04:03.330> tab<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.780> Bann<00:04:04.019> modifier<00:04:04.500> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
coordinates tab of the Bann modifier and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.780 
coordinates tab of the Bann modifier and
then<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.370> set<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.930> bank<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.470> 91<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.459> can<00:04:08.610> see

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
then just set the bank to 91 you can see

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.289 
then just set the bank to 91 you can see
it<00:04:08.880> kind<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.239> pop<00:04:09.450> up<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:10.850> now<00:04:11.850> we're<00:04:12.269> not

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
it kind of pop up and now we're not

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.259 
it kind of pop up and now we're not
getting<00:04:12.510> intersection<00:04:13.880> which<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:14.940> pretty

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
getting intersection which is pretty

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.520 
getting intersection which is pretty
cool<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:17.359> 91<00:04:18.359> seems<00:04:18.660> too<00:04:18.900> high<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.350> I'm<00:04:19.410> just

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
cool so 91 seems too high so I'm just

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.430 
cool so 91 seems too high so I'm just
going<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.709> give<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.890> 90<00:04:20.430> point<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.440> it's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
going to give it 90 point to and it's

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.050 
going to give it 90 point to and it's
still<00:04:22.620> kind<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.860> intersecting<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.610> maybe

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
still kind of intersecting so maybe

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.020 
still kind of intersecting so maybe
point<00:04:24.510> four<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:26.400> looked<00:04:26.580> quite<00:04:26.730> cool

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
point four and that looked quite cool

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.310 
point four and that looked quite cool
because<00:04:27.180> like<00:04:27.450> they're<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.870> touching

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
because like they're kind of touching

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.170 
because like they're kind of touching
but<00:04:28.560> they're<00:04:28.680> also<00:04:28.830> not<00:04:28.980> intersecting<00:04:29.700> it

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
but they're also not intersecting it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.610 
but they're also not intersecting it
really<00:04:30.389> does<00:04:30.570> look<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:30.750> kind<00:04:31.139> of<00:04:31.230> carpet

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
really does look like kind of carpet

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.820 
really does look like kind of carpet
rolled<00:04:32.520> up<00:04:33.260> just<00:04:34.260> going<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.470> turn<00:04:34.560> off<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
rolled up just going to turn off the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.379 
rolled up just going to turn off the
band<00:04:35.010> modifier<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.669> can<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.300> bit

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
band modifier so you can see it a bit

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.800 
band modifier so you can see it a bit
more<00:04:36.889> accurately<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.480> looks<00:04:39.630> quite

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
more accurately so it looks quite

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.680 
more accurately so it looks quite
realistic<00:04:40.139> and<00:04:40.880> if<00:04:41.880> we<00:04:42.060> move<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.480> bend

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
realistic and if we move the bend

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.240 
realistic and if we move the bend
modifier<00:04:44.990> along<00:04:45.990> Z<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:46.800> can<00:04:46.950> see<00:04:47.130> it's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
modifier along Z you can see it's

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.970 
modifier along Z you can see it's
rolling<00:04:47.760> out<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:52.020> last<00:04:52.230> step<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.770> just

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
rolling out so the last step is just

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.460 
rolling out so the last step is just
simply<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.570> animate<00:04:54.570> this<00:04:54.720> so<00:04:54.960> I'm<00:04:55.320> going<00:04:55.440> to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
simply to animate this so I'm going to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.810 
simply to animate this so I'm going to
start<00:04:55.680> at<00:04:55.830> frame<00:04:56.040> 0<00:04:57.650> but<00:04:58.650> keyframe<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.490> Z

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
start at frame 0 but keyframe on the Z

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.990 
start at frame 0 but keyframe on the Z
position<00:05:00.419> of<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.110> band<00:05:01.320> object<00:05:01.740> then<00:05:02.610> come<00:05:02.880> to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
position of the band object then come to

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.440 
position of the band object then come to
frame<00:05:03.210> 50<00:05:05.479> roll<00:05:06.479> this<00:05:06.690> out<00:05:10.460> here<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.000> keyframe

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
frame 50 roll this out here the keyframe

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:19.240 
frame 50 roll this out here the keyframe
there<00:05:13.490> play<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.639> back

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:27.090 

just<00:05:20.250> hide<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.580> Denver<00:05:20.909> fire

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.700 

there<00:05:27.970> we<00:05:28.120> go<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.450> can<00:05:28.600> use<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:28.900> for<00:05:29.680> a

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
there we go you can use this for a

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.070 
there we go you can use this for a
motion<00:05:30.040> graphics<00:05:30.430> project<00:05:30.820> where<00:05:31.090> maybe<00:05:31.840> you

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
motion graphics project where maybe you

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.930 
motion graphics project where maybe you
need<00:05:32.230> like<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.470> red<00:05:32.740> carpet<00:05:33.040> rolling<00:05:33.520> out<00:05:33.640> in

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
need like a red carpet rolling out in

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.060 
need like a red carpet rolling out in
the<00:05:34.090> intro<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:36.190> lengths<00:05:36.820> completely

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
the intro the lengths completely

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.700 
the intro the lengths completely
adjustable<00:05:39.210> except<00:05:40.210> it's<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.870> bit<00:05:41.050> tricky<00:05:41.440> so

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
adjustable except it's a bit tricky so

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.680 
adjustable except it's a bit tricky so
if<00:05:41.890> you<00:05:41.980> want<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.190> make<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:42.430> longer<00:05:42.760> you'll

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
if you want to make this longer you'll

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.200 
if you want to make this longer you'll
obviously<00:05:43.840> have<00:05:44.170> to<00:05:44.610> redo<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.730> key<00:05:45.910> frames

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
obviously have to redo the key frames

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.110 
obviously have to redo the key frames
but<00:05:48.030> let's<00:05:49.030> say<00:05:49.180> we<00:05:49.360> increase<00:05:49.480> C<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.940> I'm<00:05:51.940> just

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
but let's say we increase C and I'm just

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.940 
but let's say we increase C and I'm just
going<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.270> get<00:05:52.540> rid<00:05:52.690> of<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.870> keyframes<00:05:53.410> on<00:05:53.740> the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
going to get rid of the keyframes on the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.980 
going to get rid of the keyframes on the
bend<00:05:54.960> modifier<00:05:55.960> for<00:05:56.500> now<00:05:56.790> so<00:05:57.790> basically<00:05:58.060> if<00:05:58.870> we

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
bend modifier for now so basically if we

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.050 
bend modifier for now so basically if we
then<00:05:59.320> bring<00:05:59.590> this<00:05:59.710> back<00:05:59.980> we<00:06:00.340> get<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.700> kind<00:06:01.000> of

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
then bring this back we get that kind of

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.080 
then bring this back we get that kind of
glitch<00:06:01.330> so<00:06:01.930> all<00:06:02.140> you<00:06:02.260> have<00:06:02.380> to<00:06:02.440> do<00:06:02.650> is<00:06:02.800> just<00:06:03.090> set

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
glitch so all you have to do is just set

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.620 
glitch so all you have to do is just set
it<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.390> beginning<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:04.930> then<00:06:05.020> go<00:06:05.410> to<00:06:05.470> Bend

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
it to the beginning and then go to Bend

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.470 
it to the beginning and then go to Bend
fit<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.780> parent<00:06:08.170> and<00:06:08.350> then<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:10.180> have<00:06:10.300> to<00:06:10.390> kind

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
fit to parent and then you have to kind

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.010 
fit to parent and then you have to kind
of<00:06:10.570> roll<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.840> in<00:06:11.110> even<00:06:11.440> tighter<00:06:11.650> so<00:06:12.900> just<00:06:13.900> have

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
of roll it in even tighter so just have

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.080 
of roll it in even tighter so just have
to<00:06:14.200> increase<00:06:14.740> this<00:06:14.920> value<00:06:15.430> now<00:06:17.790> you<00:06:18.790> can<00:06:18.970> move

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
to increase this value now you can move

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.360 
to increase this value now you can move
the<00:06:19.270> bend<00:06:20.130> and<00:06:22.320> we<00:06:23.320> can<00:06:23.470> animate<00:06:23.920> need<00:06:24.340> a

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
the bend and we can animate need a

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.460 
the bend and we can animate need a
longer<00:06:24.850> piece<00:06:25.060> of<00:06:25.210> carpet

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.460 

so<00:06:32.970> there's<00:06:33.970> actually<00:06:34.120> an<00:06:34.360> expresso<00:06:34.780> tutorial

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
so there's actually an expresso tutorial

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.110 
so there's actually an expresso tutorial
on<00:06:35.620> how<00:06:35.740> to<00:06:35.770> do<00:06:35.980> this<00:06:36.130> I<00:06:36.310> might<00:06:36.460> do<00:06:36.580> that<00:06:36.610> next

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
on how to do this I might do that next

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.690 
on how to do this I might do that next
but<00:06:37.390> this<00:06:37.540> is<00:06:37.690> a<00:06:37.720> very<00:06:37.990> simple<00:06:38.440> version<00:06:38.640> if<00:06:39.640> you

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
but this is a very simple version if you

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.130 
but this is a very simple version if you
found<00:06:39.940> that<00:06:40.060> useful<00:06:40.210> please<00:06:40.570> share<00:06:40.840> it<00:06:41.050> and

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
found that useful please share it and

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.220 
found that useful please share it and
thanks<00:06:42.070> for<00:06:42.130> watching
