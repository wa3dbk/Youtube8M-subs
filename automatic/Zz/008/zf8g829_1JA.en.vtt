work versus not so much work my first

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.230 
work versus not so much work my first
impressions<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:48.979> were<00:01:49.220> first<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.150> all<00:01:50.210> I

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
impressions of it were first of all I

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.180 
impressions of it were first of all I
loved<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.380> light<00:01:51.650> I<00:01:51.860> love<00:01:52.070> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
loved it it's just light I love the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.840 
loved it it's just light I love the
weight<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.430> it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
weight of it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.820 
weight of it
the<00:01:53.180> initial<00:01:53.630> disappointment<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.320> surprises

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
the initial disappointment and surprises

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.000 
the initial disappointment and surprises
I<00:01:54.920> guess<00:01:55.130> were<00:01:55.550> that<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:56.660> one<00:01:56.869> had<00:01:57.380> less<00:01:57.770> hard

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
I guess were that this one had less hard

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.010 
I guess were that this one had less hard
disk<00:01:58.190> space<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.520> my<00:01:58.640> apps<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.060> media<00:01:59.750> and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
disk space for my apps and media and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.960 
disk space for my apps and media and
then<00:02:00.440> also<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.830> RAM<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> RAM<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.700> this
