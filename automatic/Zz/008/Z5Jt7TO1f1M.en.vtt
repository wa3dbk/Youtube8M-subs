00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.440
 Hello, concurrent to the meeting you are 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.060
 here again with me for this paulo 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 alexandre people are going to give one more 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.160
 step in the ethical part of the service 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.480
 public ethics in public administration 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.090
 today the subject that is not very treated 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.949
 in public competition tests, which is the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.660
 decree 6 thousand 29 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 so we'll be at the expense of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.140
 decree 2029 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.969
 part of the public service then looks 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.480
 in this context our bat 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.210
 Papos the decree 6 thousand and 29 that won 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.969
 decree 7.029 then I realize how you 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:55.140
 already seen in the material o the decree 1,171 the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.949
 decree 1,171 it is a decree that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 limits the conduct of public servants right 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.189
 the federal executive branch, I 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.080
 key always the public power server 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.439
 federal executive 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.659
 then rules deontological rules rules of 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.840
 moral conduct behavior rules 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.030
 moral then comes that second step 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 which are duties the duties of the server 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 the public within the context of the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.549
 ethics and the fences then its three 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.130
 main points of decree 1,181 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 I realize that it is directed to the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.710
 server is not conducive to the server 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.900
 how the life of the public servant is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 and work done during the day 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 day at work in the structure 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.820
 Organizational and then right at the end of 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 decree 1.181 to have part of commissions 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.369
 remembers informing with the breadth of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 decree 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.479
 then a lot of subsection i was revoked 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.520
 of the decree 1,181 a is true began was 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.060
 have already been revoked since they were 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.460
 again the decree 1,181 was revoked 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.570
 by lawyers, various information was 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.640
 again in decree 3029 then the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.619
 from decree 29 to validate this 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.890
 structure of ethics committees 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.720
 information to that effect. 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.130
 do not be surprised then come 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.680

 facebook page also talked to

 alexandre just follow photos in 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.530
 install quiet beauty then just look 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.630
 with the idea of cats 29 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.530
 Context sentences 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.320
 you 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.630
 this structure of the decree here is the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.430
 first thing there in that information 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.500
 in that structure that I put to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.160
 you have 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:52.269
 just look at our right direct administration 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.470
 and we have the amplitude of the decree 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:00.440
 indirect administration and we have 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.459
 beauty delegates then come with me 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.860
 here in the direct administration part is 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.730
 which has a structure of the presidency 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.739
 Republic right of presidency 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.780
 republic more ministries administration 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.600
 indirect autarky 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.280
 beauty other than just the initials foundation 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.989
 public enterprise and society of 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.850
 mixed economy 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.980
 so there are three situations here 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.760
 delegates also this whole structure 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.890
 is bound decree 1,171 everyone 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.560
 here was bound by the decree 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.239
 create an ethics committee to deal 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.709
 issues of server ethics 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.950
 public management attention 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.920
 direct and indirect representatives but the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.880
 focus of our of our structure also 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.540
 here o 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.730
 what Decree 1.129 did I realize when 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.650
 the ethics committees we have a 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 blow're 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.310
 there are more than 30 ministries we have 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.390
 dozens of municipalities public foundations 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.060
 public companies 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.049
 outside the delegates, as well as 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.530
 are required 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:15.859
 so what happens we had to 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.680
 need to create looks only from one 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.989
 need to create a system for 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.930
 to manage these ethics committees is 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.680
 This is the purpose of Decree 7.029 because 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.080
 it arose from the need to create 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.630
 a system to manage these 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.490
 why ethics committees should 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.900
 do not get loose I need the decree 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.389
 from 94 in 2007 to an ethics committee 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.550
 was created there was created a 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.009
 specific ethics committee to 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.660
 work the structure the system of 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.270
 management of these ethics committees 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.800
 so I have an ethics committee in 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.289
 the whole of the direct and 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.389
 in the but the delegate shortcuts 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.699
 beauty and makes it very ethical committee 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.780
 sometimes the same problem solved 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.630
 different way 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.970
 so why did not this happen 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.150
 a specific ethics committee 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.460
 linked to the structure of the presidency of 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.720
 So we have here in the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.900
 structure of the presidency of the republic 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.860
 a commission called Sep 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.280
 is the public ethics committee 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.400
 we only have one series an ethics committee 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.070
 public are the other ethics committees 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.810
 let's mature this idea then 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.669
 I created two institutes I have to win 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.990
 a third I'm wondering for you 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.889
 following training 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.690
 I have some ep that is the commission of 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.330
 ethics linked to the presidency of the 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.320
 Republic and the ethics committees that 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.630
 treats the legal decree 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.919
 I realize the following first idea that I 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.930
 I have to play for you and you. 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.000
 understand what the decree is doing 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.010
 decree will not deal with the structure 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.199
 behavior of the public agent before the 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.039
 society and other actors 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.169
 public 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.349
 The idea here is to build the structure of 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.990
 ethics committee and see the system of 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.460
 management of public ethics, the 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.699
 public ethics management so that people 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.030
 they can develop activities 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.669
 specific 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.699
 focus here the Ethics Committee of the 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.919
 structure training a number of factors 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.949
 Okay, cool, let's get mature. 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.750
 this idea that with me looks at it in another 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.270
 very relevant information 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.820
 how I told you the decree 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:32.080
 provisions of Decree 7.029 revoked the 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.710
 some sections of the 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.650
 decree 1,171 so I'll have to speak 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.480
 within the decree 7.029, which was 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.000
 revoked has very informal 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.110
 are in Decree 7.029 that alludes to 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.450
 direct to decree 1,171 ta but it's all in 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.140
 training and structuring of the 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.140
 ethics committee
