00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.620
 opening and you me always voting that 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.850
 I knocked so we have to do something 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.440
 more you work for the next four 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.059
 minutes and grains just a small one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.650
 video release is that we have some 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.570
 interact with you and I can 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.580
 I give a small update or churn out 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.900
 all those things your next few packages 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 open or of course I have not 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.960
 millions of coins because i'm not 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.310
 sponsored for a coin sponge because me 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 find then you know and that is match against 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 my principles and I enjoyed the prize 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.269
 the point site are super high and me 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.380
 do you mean 1350 700 k coins? 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 I think that is way too much so then 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.859
 I don't understand evening altair because 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.480
 I think personally too high 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.940
 jets look at what I return 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.410
 I won't advertise coins gables 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 first get it also joe she could 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.930
 85 generally 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.550
 You can go there for a new video for something 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 way of remco the train loses and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.460
 then we'll see what is fake 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.870
 problems are only 6 out of ordinary 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 totally the balls and the problem 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 That means that I don't have an English exam 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 I had him in cambridge exam actually 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 just a higher level is english and one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.329
 high level english they are super handy 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.399
 if you have that you will soon be 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.719
 adopted international studies 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.190
 so that problem is that I am so with 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.629
 chic voice is like i'm really way too 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 have smoked many things 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.719
 so there is not very ideal so that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.220
 will still think there tomorrow 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.900
 would soon have a happy face 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.460
 level I am very curious that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.260
 everything goes but if you do 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 for example xbox live later 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.740
 european are channel or, for example, 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.240
 for xbox points the room that meant 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.369
 description channel I hope to my 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.900
 xbox live points on my ps and then be 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.490
 price on cheap sites buy through pay pal 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.070
 I order I go through the within five 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.479
 seconds so you see a dot com and me 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.560
 do this really not what week lives 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.360
 that advertised but it is too 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.439
 may also be controversial 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.729
 but no i don't want advertised in that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.229
 people then seriously score the bag that I 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 always use today 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 there is a lot of cheap how to pay from two 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 of which marx boys guys guys could 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.430
 You pay 32 euros in us there 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 the Netherlands the parents of 50 euros for 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 us I find a lot cheaper and carl 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 by viewers card or was a lie the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 description if you like a pound PS10 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 your embrace signals playstation 4 costs 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.350
 also money for online than whatever 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.670
 in contradiction I was with playstation 3 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.409
 because then if it is legal free where the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.880
 you also have to pay for playstation 4 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.530
 if you search for codes for example 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 for relatively cheap prices 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.619
 Doncaster seemed like the guy in the description 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.909
 look further from there but I still had 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.740
 one question thinks it is wrong 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.270
 meanwhile are opening and that is 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 you will like it as a time 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.299
 won vlog channel tribe and no give up 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.459
 channel that than my gaming channel 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.720
 inherit tony bobble do n't get it 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.200
 honest super about paul it's true 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.040
 worth a lot of money 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.629
 of course it can't be my gaming 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.220
 channel but every now and then one 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.879
 time in the week or so often space 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.110
 flow the 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.580
 or just in one of the topics that 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.959
 we find interesting to talk about 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.760
 few minutes and then i go i want one 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.959
 would give some nice twist because I am going 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.610
 of course not so whole numbers on 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.930
 camera stand five minutes, really together 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.459
 or not saying things that not nobody 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.569
 If you are interested then you will of course go 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.040
 just a few nice things 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.989
 adding is that I like it in itself 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 concept like you with thick flakes 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.230
 nel is just for fun then you can 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.550
 the description and always clean 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.080
 I'll talk by the other time 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.940
 makita doesn't bother me so you can 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.980

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.569
 well my voice is and probably will 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.680
 my voice also often skip the heals 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 recovering is a little bit 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.950

 the trust in the pot 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.480

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.440
