00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 internet games a very naughty series 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.550

 Today 's game is the mustache 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.050
 Miguel A is a game that you are a game of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 fps actually online has a certain 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.500
 young galerinha then you enter and have 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.870
 several people from different countries 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.780
 Playing you play against them 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.820
 Well anyway it's a normal species, but it's 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 in browser then you do not need to download 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
 now you just have to I think the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.460
 flash if I'm not mistaken installed 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.230

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.050
 I'm already well, I'm crazy. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.789
 at this stage for more than a year in which 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.340
 the call room with little people who have 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:12.479
 will consider giving the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 salle ta beauty is that the players I 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 am has no name forgot to put 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.540
 My name actually has a way to change your 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 name 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.770
 so I will choose my team that is the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 bruno da pena or five five 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.900
 the green that the companies now thought 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 With me, I'll finish this round. 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.250
 if only she came in that she is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 seeing these people are from the blue team has 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.729
 a basic peasant in his view a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.100
 dude there comes the sale because you're not 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.100
 killing carlos marcio carlos 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 now come on top also not 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.770
 they can kill and he's trying to kill 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.110
 I said it but two died 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 It was kind of weird, let's go. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.860
 but it is the Brazilian champion who 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.200
 I think of you and your head. 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.550
 I do not know what their role is really 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.800
 crazy bank 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.300
 finally a game much bigger than you 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.460
 spend a little of the time not talking to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.240
 you are a technological marvel of 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 game chart because it 's made for 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.350
 run on any colca pc you need 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.790
 city as I know I 'm killing General 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.560
 face and have a little keyboard problem 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.590
 is not working letter 'then not 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:39.050
 second to the side how like the surgery 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:44.680
 The fast shot guy connects both very 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:47.450
 interesting really can achieve 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.390
 buy the best then I got to 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:55.040
 buy one in the other guns I did not see the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.620
 game is actually on and such but it is a 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.030
 play and think that she was not recording 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.360
 you think it is recorded in the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.840
 internet on facebook replied 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.670
 hardest game in the world and came to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.370
 to record a video of the world game but it is 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.549
 a game that is a lot of content is to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.170
 Talk is on when I close the game and recorded 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.549
 closing the game because it will not have 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.080
 A lot of talk because I 'm going to talk. 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:29.060
 basically it's going to be kind to 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:32.900
 I passed the accor I die die street and if the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.180
 face of feeling a face of that case said 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:42.620
 There was a guy that did not die the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:44.840
 default is're saying then is this movie 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.980
 Take the time, I did not go by then. 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.780
 I recorded a video but I did not think 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.570
 was as interesting as it could be 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.489
 stay safe when something 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.269
 you are more inspired as well 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.489
 I record the most difficult game in the world 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.170
 Then I remembered this game that had a 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.640
 time that I played with a certain frequency 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.209
 where I had nothing to play 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.160
 i is a game but the tinga no man i will not 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.840
 This is one of the games of the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.710
 games that you should win a 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.790
 prize of the game and close the touching soul 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.500
 but I wish I think are very 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.760
 of course, I do not know 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.510
 there it is anyway the guy there in china 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:36.260
 and the king 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:39.020
 i finally let's walk it works 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.620
 The game has to be well done oak o 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.600
 beauty compare with a box 2 of life not 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 it will be a lot of good but the game 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.830
 considering what is done is to play in 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:57.830
 browser 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:05:01.370
 he is very well done 5-0 down there 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.900
 back that there is almost almost killed a 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:16.270
 tv or anything 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:16.270
 It's a good game here and there. 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.250
 question will be that he killed put the name 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.290
 that I could know right? 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.970
 looks like it donates ant and comments on it 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.410
 down this comment really should 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.410
 receive a comment oscar 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.000
 already the maternal grandmother work 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.550
 hey our way of sifting you my God 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.530
 It's good to have these people for today. 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.820
 here it is not very accurate in complex 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 It 's only true to show the game to 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.570
 You're going to let me play you down. 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.770
 If you liked a look and I say 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.750
 obviously you are giving yourself suggestions 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.850
 of games to show that in the series or if 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.110
 are in the suggestion forming in the 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.730
 comments 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.320
 And I also say that you found 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.790
 play the game say what you found 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.760
 if there is one thing I forgot to say 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.850
 some stage does not have some favela only one 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.570
 map has not thrown a gun at all 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.180
 you think 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.320
 and that's it, you liked the video by 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.950
 please leave June which helps a lot 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.930
 disclosure estate shows your voice 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.690
 I think people should show you 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.570
 because you have always fought in battle 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.950
 whether medieval battles or battles 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.200
 latest wars 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.660
 so the voice really feeling a 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.850
 nostalgia for the moments of them killing 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.370
 other people then could play and 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.100
 you do not need to download our face 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.600
 Fire in the game you need to download is not 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.250
 a quick thing so your grandmother 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.640
 he did one got the initial training 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.630
 and young father saddle is a quick pride in 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.000
 white is this 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.560
 I think playing on that last beam of 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.560
 kill someone this time at least nÃ© 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.530
 after the war in guinea i can not walk 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.520
 to the left because of my grandfather's 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:23.540
 working 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.540
 I sent it very good 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:37.650
 Finding a friend to remind me a little 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.730
 some flaws some maps in fact 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:44.100
 funk black playing white bridge o 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:49.290
 guy will kill me my brother kill me 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:51.240
 brother but I played the time of my 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.860
 life and I have a phase that the 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:59.150
 So I do not remember. 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.150
 Remember, that's all I'm going to say.
