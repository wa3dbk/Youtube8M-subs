00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
see if we can head into the center of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
see if we can head into the center of
this<00:01:26.010> uh<00:01:27.229> alright<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.530> can't<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:31.580> okay<00:01:32.580> see

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this uh alright I can't do that okay see

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
this uh alright I can't do that okay see
if<00:01:33.330> we<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.630> hit<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.439> way<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
if we can hit all the way down but this

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.469 
if we can hit all the way down but this
might<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.119> solid<00:01:40.939> ok<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.000> i<00:01:42.119> guess<00:01:42.180> that's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
might be solid ok so i guess that's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.030 
might be solid ok so i guess that's
solid<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.320> can't<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.619> through<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.830> but

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
solid and you can't go through that but

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
solid and you can't go through that but

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I mean this is just it's a very

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200 
I mean this is just it's a very
intricate<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.619> very<00:02:05.369> well-designed<00:02:05.909> map

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
intricate and very well-designed map

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.150 
intricate and very well-designed map
there's<00:02:06.960> lots<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> space<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.040> it

as<00:02:08.310> i<00:02:08.429> get<00:02:08.579> down<00:02:08.729> here<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.869> tall<00:02:10.320> this

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
as i get down here that's how tall this

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.720 
as i get down here that's how tall this
map<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.250> see<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> park

completely finished but the amount of

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.479 
completely finished but the amount of
detail<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.040> far<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:39.470> amazing<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> even

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
because I mean let's just take a quick

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.050 
because I mean let's just take a quick
gander<00:03:12.269> over<00:03:12.599> here<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.579> see<00:03:14.579> how<00:03:14.640> wide<00:03:14.819> let's

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
gander over here and see how wide let's

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.240 
gander over here and see how wide let's
go<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.360> we<00:03:15.450> still<00:03:15.629> have<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.019> huge<00:03:16.590> amount<00:03:17.069> of

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
go so we still have a huge amount of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.819 
go so we still have a huge amount of
space<00:03:17.459> where<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.569> are<00:03:18.690> four<00:03:19.290> buildings<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
space where there are four buildings and

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.030 
space where there are four buildings and
stuff<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:21.420> don't<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.930> use<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.650> texture

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
stuff and I don't I use this texture

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.199 
stuff and I don't I use this texture
pack<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.430> love<00:03:23.549> them<00:03:23.670> using<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:23.940> right<00:03:24.060> one

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
pack and love them using the right one

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.220 
pack and love them using the right one
probably<00:03:24.450> not<00:03:24.629> but<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.890> amazing<00:03:26.069> uh

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
probably not but it is just amazing uh

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.890 
probably not but it is just amazing uh
the<00:03:28.230> detail<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.980> went<00:03:29.040> into<00:03:29.129> this<00:03:29.400> is

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
the detail that went into this is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.420 
the detail that went into this is
probably<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.440> best<00:03:31.560> I've<00:03:31.709> seen<00:03:31.739> so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
probably one of the best I've seen so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.789 
probably one of the best I've seen so
far<00:03:32.540> or<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:33.959> going<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.260> see<00:03:34.319> detail

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
far or and I'm going to see detail

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.410 
far or and I'm going to see detail
because<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.549> not<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.790> detailed

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
because it's really not that detailed

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.530 
because it's really not that detailed
but<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.260> size<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.829> it<00:03:37.950> alone<00:03:38.420> makes<00:03:39.420> it

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
but just the size of it alone makes it

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.650 
but just the size of it alone makes it
one<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> best<00:03:39.840> creations<00:03:40.290> who<00:03:40.350> ever<00:03:40.470> seen

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
one of the best creations who ever seen

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.840 
one of the best creations who ever seen

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
for someone to put the time in not

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.059 
for someone to put the time in not
laggin<00:03:45.389> see<00:03:45.480> detail<00:03:45.810> by<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.989> time<00:03:46.290> into

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
laggin see detail by the time into

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.890 
laggin see detail by the time into
