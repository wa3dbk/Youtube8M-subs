less than a minute of fly time this is
the<00:02:20.920> contact<00:02:21.370> points<00:02:21.760> most<00:02:21.910> likely<00:02:22.390> there<00:02:23.260> are

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
the contact points most likely there are

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.140 
the contact points most likely there are
several<00:02:23.560> tutorials<00:02:23.920> online<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.910> found

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
several tutorials online and I found

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.910 
several tutorials online and I found
that<00:02:25.300> bending<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> right<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.319> left<00:02:26.590> pins

that bending the right and left pins

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.010 
that bending the right and left pins
outward<00:02:27.610> with<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> little<00:02:28.239> bit<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.450> force<00:02:28.690> helps

with<00:02:29.200> charging<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:30.370> make<00:02:30.580> sure<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.850> don't

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
with charging just make sure you don't

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.059 
with charging just make sure you don't
use<00:02:31.209> too<00:02:31.390> much<00:02:31.420> force<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.230> don't<00:02:32.530> over<00:02:32.830> bend
