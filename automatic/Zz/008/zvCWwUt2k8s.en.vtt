and<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.950> still<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.520> lots<00:01:16.969> of<00:01:17.210> beans<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:17.659> year

year<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.240> think<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:23.630> all<00:01:23.719> due<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:23.929> my

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
year and I think it's all due to my

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.999 
year and I think it's all due to my
compost<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.700> I've<00:01:25.850> been<00:01:25.969> putting<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:27.009> but

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
compost that I've been putting it but

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.600 
compost that I've been putting it but
this<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.340> what<00:01:28.490> happens<00:01:30.310> with<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.429> cover

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610
