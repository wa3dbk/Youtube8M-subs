00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.930 

each<00:02:14.980> gun<00:02:15.310> only<00:02:15.520> carries<00:02:15.880> eight<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.240> mag

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
each gun only carries eight in the mag

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.370 
each gun only carries eight in the mag
which<00:02:18.940> i<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.300> might<00:02:19.720> actually<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> little

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
which i think might actually be a little

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.110 
which i think might actually be a little
bit<00:02:20.710> more<00:02:20.950> than<00:02:21.220> what<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> Makarov<00:02:21.730> actually

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
bit more than what the Makarov actually

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.160 
bit more than what the Makarov actually
carries<00:02:22.450> unless<00:02:22.630> you're<00:02:22.810> talking<00:02:22.900> about

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
carries unless you're talking about

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.030 
carries unless you're talking about
seven<00:02:23.800> plus<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.280> chamber<00:02:26.040> yeah

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
seven plus one in the chamber yeah

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.620 
seven plus one in the chamber yeah
overall<00:02:27.280> there's<00:02:27.520> nothing<00:02:27.790> too<00:02:28.000> overly

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
overall there's nothing too overly

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630 
overall there's nothing too overly
amazing<00:02:29.230> or<00:02:29.350> flashy<00:02:29.680> about<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.190> pistol<00:02:30.550> is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
that sound although they're definitely

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
that sound although they're definitely
very<00:02:44.530> loud<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.550> could<00:02:46.000> deal<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> little<00:02:46.990> bit

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
very loud I could deal with a little bit

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.890 
very loud I could deal with a little bit
better<00:02:48.340> sound<00:02:48.790> editing<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:49.690> not

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
better sound editing but I'm not

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:48.270 
better sound editing but I'm not
complaining<00:02:50.350> too<00:02:50.620> much
