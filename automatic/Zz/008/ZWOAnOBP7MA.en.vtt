holes for the bottom I got front I got

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.170 
holes for the bottom I got front I got
the<00:00:23.650> back<00:00:23.830> of<00:00:24.010> their<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.400> got<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.610> top<00:00:24.820> there

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
the back of their I got the top there

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.359 
the back of their I got the top there
and<00:00:25.600> got<00:00:25.750> me<00:00:25.840> two<00:00:25.990> sides<00:00:26.260> and<00:00:26.619> this<00:00:27.070> is<00:00:27.190> pretty

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
and got me two sides and this is pretty

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.520 
and got me two sides and this is pretty
much<00:00:27.460> how<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.730> amps<00:00:28.000> going<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.240> set<00:00:28.420> as<00:00:29.230> you

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
much how the amps going to set as you

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.140 
much how the amps going to set as you
can<00:00:29.650> see<00:00:29.830> that's<00:00:30.310> has<00:00:30.490> pretty<00:00:30.730> much<00:00:30.910> going<00:00:31.090> to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
can see that's has pretty much going to

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.090 
can see that's has pretty much going to
sit<00:00:31.300> in<00:00:31.330> on<00:00:31.480> each<00:00:31.570> side<00:00:31.840> 1<00:00:32.500> amp<00:00:32.710> because<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:32.949> two

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
sit in on each side 1 amp because it two

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.160 
sit in on each side 1 amp because it two
of<00:00:33.219> these<00:00:33.309> big<00:00:33.550> monoblocks<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:34.749> at<00:00:34.870> one<00:00:34.989> per

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
of these big monoblocks so at one per

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.369 
of these big monoblocks so at one per
side<00:00:35.469> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.780> I've<00:00:37.899> got<00:00:37.929> my<00:00:38.109> distribution

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
side and then I've got my distribution

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.049 
side and then I've got my distribution
block<00:00:38.649> at<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.859> bottom<00:00:39.100> here<00:00:39.219> which<00:00:39.789> comes

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
block at the bottom here which comes

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.290 
block at the bottom here which comes
into<00:00:40.359> one<00:00:40.569> gauge<00:00:40.809> into<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.159> bottom<00:00:42.429> and<00:00:42.579> four

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
into one gauge into the bottom and four

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.880 
into one gauge into the bottom and four
fours<00:00:43.539> only<00:00:43.929> need<00:00:44.079> three<00:00:44.350> somebody<00:00:44.739> gets

fours only need three somebody gets

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.340 
fours only need three somebody gets
around<00:00:45.129> but<00:00:45.879> you<00:00:45.969> get<00:00:46.089> it<00:00:46.149> now<00:00:46.659> power<00:00:47.019> of<00:00:47.199> us

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
around but you get it now power of us

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.660 
around but you get it now power of us
going<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.679> bottom<00:00:47.920> here<00:00:48.159> and<00:00:48.399> then<00:00:48.489> ramp

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
going to the bottom here and then ramp

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.939 
going to the bottom here and then ramp
tails<00:00:48.879> are<00:00:49.089> into<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.449> top<00:00:49.629> I'm<00:00:50.620> going<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.859> have

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
tails are into the top I'm going to have

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.410 
tails are into the top I'm going to have
a<00:00:50.979> smaller<00:00:51.280> amp<00:00:51.579> which<00:00:52.300> is<00:00:53.069> this<00:00:54.069> amp<00:00:54.359> so<00:00:55.359> the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
same half size of the monos and it'll be

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.590 
same half size of the monos and it'll be
on<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:58.989> top<00:00:59.199> of<00:00:59.319> the<00:00:59.409> top<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.249> box<00:01:00.600> we've
