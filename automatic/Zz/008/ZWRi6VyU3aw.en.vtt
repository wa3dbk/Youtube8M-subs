00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:05.344
I'd like that you all came here. Because everybody's part of this group.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:26.044
I'd like to say something for you all.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:32.744
The historians say that when a troop...

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.224
...when an army goes to a battle....

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.904
They have a battle cry.

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:44.604
This afternoon we created our battle cry.

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.624
Do you know which is our battle cry?

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:50.704
Pound your friends' chest like this.

00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:54.184
You can tell him and he tells you the phrase:

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:56.244
"PALMEIRAS IS BIG!'

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.704
You all can leave your place and tell everybody that PALMEIRAS IS BIG!

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.484
It's too low, louder: PALMEIRAS IS BIG!

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:35.324
We need to rescue the history that's painted in this dressing room's wall.

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:46.724
When I played against Palmeiras, it was fantastic when its fans shouted "Au au au, Edmudo is an animal"

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:54.744
We need to rescue the spirit of 'Animal' above us here.

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.224
PALMEIRAS IS BIG!

00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:01.584
And if Palmeiras is big, Palmeiras needs an army!

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:06.764
I can see the army reunited here today.

00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:14.104
And when an army joins together, it needs the weapons.

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:20.124
The weapons that were prepared during the pre-season trainings.

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:21.984
We are ready to the war.

00:02:23.984 --> 00:02:27.824
And who enters... it's about winning it!

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:33.404
Today begins a war and we are in to win.

00:02:33.844 --> 00:02:34.644
You know why?

00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:39.924
We need to rescue the grandeur of this club.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.244
PALMEIRAS IS BIG!

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:47.624
PALMEIRAS IS BIG!

00:02:49.364 --> 00:02:51.724
This is our battle cry!

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:59.724
Today we begin a new history inside this club.

00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:05.244
Because I want to see my photo inside this dressing room.

00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:08.524
If you also want it...

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:13.344
Get your weapons ready!

00:03:14.804 --> 00:03:16.624
Today we play agains Audax...

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:18.504
Another day Ponte Preta (another Brazilian team)

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:19.944
Then Corinthians.

00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:25.424
They're going to see the army that raised here today!

00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:29.324
An army that will fight!

00:03:29.764 --> 00:03:33.284
And we're going to bring our fans along with us!

00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:36.184
Because I also want the fans shouting...

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:39.784
Au au au, ZÃ© Roberto is an animal!

00:03:40.624 --> 00:03:43.464
Au au au, Renato is an animal!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.984
Au au au, Lucas is an animal!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.344
Au au au, Fernando is an animal!

00:03:51.824 --> 00:03:54.404
And we're going to start to win the match today!

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:57.404
Because I can see right into your eyes!

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:01.484
We are crazy to battle!

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:05.084
Let's go to the battle?!
