00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.900
 Today we are going to tell you all the details of the latest Roller novelty of the Elite brand, the Turbo Muin model. 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.900
 As you can see the Turbo Muin is a roller that has nothing to do 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.919
 with no other you've seen to date, it's a design revolution 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.100
 and benefits 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.900
 note that as we have to remove the wheel of the bike to mount it on 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 Turbo Muin, the only thing we need to avoid having to walk 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.800
 assembling and disassembling nothing later, it is a cassette of the same number 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.800
 speeds that our bike and as cheap as possible, we do not even need a cheap wheel 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.290
 nor a special cover 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.200
 nothing, just a cassette, and also here the noise is not an inconvenience 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 Then you will see it in the test that we are going to do. Because there is no cover 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 that is rubbing on a roller, here the whole mechanism is inside 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 and the noise is greatly minimized. The Turbo Muin is valid for both road and mountain bikes, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Of course, our bike has to have a conventional axle on the rear wheel, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 a shaft of 9 mm, like this one that I show here, if I had a through shaft 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 of 142 threading like this, we could not use it in the Turbo Muin, although 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 it's worth as much for 130 and 135 hubs, only that we have to put 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 this separator on one side or the other. We have here a bike with the wheel removed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 and we are going to put it on the Turbo Muin, it would be the same as putting 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.540
 a wheel, if you have any questions, you can take a look at the video 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.850
 how to remove and put the wheels. Many of you will be thinking, 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.840
 What if I want to measure my speed while I'm training? How have I removed the back wheel? 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.800
 Even if I have a rear odometer, I can not do anything. Well Elite has thought about that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.300
 and put a magnet inside this circle, more or less this 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.390
 height, we have put here a Garmin sensor 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.100
 to detect the inner magnet and be able to do the test 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.100
 speed along with the sound that you are going to see now. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.500
 But before doing so do not forget that you have to fit 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.540
 the front wheel so that the bike is balanced 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.850
 We have not shown you this chop in another video but it has the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.459
 peculiarity that 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.400
 It can be adjusted in height, so nothing else, we put it 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 on the front wheel and we start with the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 sound test. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.099
 As you can see 40 km per hour and 59 km maximum. 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.209
 And how does Turbo Muin work? Well, it is characterized by the direct transmission of 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.200
 the power, works with Fluid technology, as 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.309
 we explained in the first video on rollers, but I would call it super Fluid 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.649
 because the system is much bigger and the resistance between a development and 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.290
 another one is noticed much more. 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 So you can see how versatile the Turbo Muin is, let's explain these 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.040
 two graphs that we have here that are developed 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.800
 with Turbo Muin itself, one with a long development, 53 x 11 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.899
 and one with a short development of 39 x 28. 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:06.939
 In the vertical axis we have the watts and in the horizontal axis we have the cadence and the speed. 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.539
 If we go first to the long development, 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:15.499
 note that with a cadence of 90 and a 53 x 11 we are developing a power 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:20.199
 of more than 2500 watts, so you have a reference, a sprinter 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.469
 at the height of the sprint 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.259
 can develop a peak power of 2300 watts so if we want 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:31.499
 to train sprint to the top the Turbo Muin allows us, with the resistance that we 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.529
 opposes and if we want to train with tranquility 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:39.500
 with a 39 x 28 so you can see an example and a cadence of 50, 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.729
 we are developing a power 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.700
 of less than 40 around 30 plus or minus 30 watts and we can train quietly, 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.129
 We have a very large versatility 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.800
 to train with a lot of power or with little power 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.899
 only changing the development of our bike. 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:00.889
 And as an anecdote, I will tell you that when Indurain flashed the record of the hour, 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.069
 the average power he made 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.229
 it was 510 watts, so if you want 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.839
 surpass the record of the hour of Indurain like objective 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.800
 you would have to, with a Turbo Muin and a cadence of 50 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.200
 we will be developing more or less 500 watts, 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.239
 so for 60 minutes at 50 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.939
 of cadence with a 53 x 11 we would beat the record of the hour of Indurain, 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.400
 a good goal for a good workout. 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.409
 And to fold it you only need to remove this screw 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.009
 For security 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.009
 and we fold the leg 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.000
 And that would be the Turbo Muin folded. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Nothing more, just tell you what the roller is 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 more stable, silent and powerful on which I have never trained. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And communicate that we have it available on our page 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
