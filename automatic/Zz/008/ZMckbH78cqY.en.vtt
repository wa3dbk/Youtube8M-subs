00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.870
 just with the tuning I do not know what happened 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.700
 today they are all so has 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.110
 gone a little bit to be careful with that 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.270
 to keep working 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.460
 physically you think a lot about attitude 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.220
 The account of 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.710
 misfortunes maricarmen fernando weapons 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.249
 we hear the young man who has been in the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.709
 breakfast piano 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.919
 he came to do the casting as I am 

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:53.959
 Thousands 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.479
 This is effectively I think it has 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:59.299
 come more than once to do lounge and 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.990
 lennox or lennox and you touch and now you 

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:04.120
 he did well as a pianist 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.980
 what do we tell him he will be left without 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.290
 go to the next round 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.440
 happens as a pianist impersonator 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.560
 companion yes that enters and is in charge 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.110
 of the piano round like that well 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.840
 load the piano 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.240
 Sea 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.720
 you feel a little bit and you feel a 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.930
 little bit of nerves on your part 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.850
 and it is that this nervousness is felt in 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.560
 that panting you have there at the moment 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.600
 of the breath is a very good 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.600
 invitation that makes shakira 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.710
 you have to have a little more confidence 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.479
 for me has been very pretty 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.550
 very good interpretation fernando 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.220
 thank you very much ricardo we hear it 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.919
 I think you're doing much better 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.590
 songs that the dancers think you 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.100
 help to hold the monthly invitation 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.100
 and one back 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.590
 I also want to congratulate the 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.520
 interpretation I think it's a good 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.520
 interpretation of the song 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.160
 I think you also have the voice bell 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.380
 and that's also good now for 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.090
 observations it seems to me that in general 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.960
 says mari carmen there have been some 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.509
 tunings on all the serious 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.340
 you have to take care of that and as always 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.750
 We have a permanent management issue 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.150
 air that does not feel so much in these 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.310
 songs but that nevertheless is still 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.080
 there you find it hard to get to the end of the 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.940
 sentence in the style of the sentence and that 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.099
 also from time to time we listen to you 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.500
 breath panting along the 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.300
 song and it shows more towards the end 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.520
 I'm sorry because it's costing you to get there 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.889
 until the end of the song however 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.630
 the interpretation wins and then it looks 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.700
 very nice to fellow citizens 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.930
 very well it has to be sworn many 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.930
 thanks news
