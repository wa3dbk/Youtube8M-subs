00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello everyone with you tracer alex i'm a pilot 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.590
 attack helicopter in the battlefield 4 game 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.719
 many novice pilots are set 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.330
 question how to drag in public 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.400
 drummer may guides series aimed at 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.680
 help for beginners and not so skillful 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 pilot and side dish and find the answer to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.260
 the main question of newbies I got a drummer 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 what's next is a little bit of theory 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 heavy thunderstorm attack helicopter 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 armored vehicles and infantry in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 battlefield 4 attack helicopter 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.250
 represented by three models american 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.680
 Chinese viper for 10w and Russian mi-28 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.160
 each helicopter is unique and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.780
 has both pluses and minuses 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.920
 for example viper has small dimensions 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.570
 greater maneuverability unlike mi-28 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 who wins in speed on has 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.960
 big size 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.719
 it's perfect for big cards 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 for example the road hunger viper is excellent 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.750
 Suitable for city maps Chinese alas 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.840
 Chinese people do not have strongly expressed the pros and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.420
 Now minuses you have a great enough 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.780
 gives his preference to the American 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.610
 viper and so I think you wonâ€™t be surprised 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.509
 the fact that everyone needs practice in 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.580
 piloting 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.009
 and it concerns not only beginners 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
 helicopter works but also experienced for 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.900
 start you need to find an empty series 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 preferably with the siege card of Shanghai if you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 rookie battlefield 4 then your path 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 good piloting begins with 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.720
 training ground and so i'm not just from 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.210
 shit put in exactly the background that you 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.189
 now see these places you are 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.740
 must learn to fly without difficulty 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.170
 many naturally ask questions but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.110
 why even just show off experienced pilots 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.659
 but take my word for it is not so 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.310
 First of all, every pilot should 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.530
 learn to feel the helicopter 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.049
 feel its dimensions and speed when 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.969
 performing those or other maneuvers you 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.490
 must pick up their sensitivity 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.540
 mouse in the technique that you were comfortable 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.159
 and it is not problematic to fly a helicopter 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.090
 for example my mouse sensitivity in 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.770
 technology in the game is 45 percent 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.410
 so 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.810
 go to the training ground conduct 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 you need settings and try to fly 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.330
 it is also necessary to make it a rule before 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.880
 how to go fly in public 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.640
 need to go to an empty sulfur or polygon 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.040
 or mind and even stretch my pilot 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.470
 which flew 350 hours is necessary 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.680
 constantly warm up on an empty server 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.270
 before public or clan thieves as 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.980
 piloting experience 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.380
 and shooting courses peculiar 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.080
 forget the conclusions yourself 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.090
 that's all reminds and was the first guide 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.370
 on the attack helicopter the next part 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.620
 will be dedicated to the stage of the drummer and that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.260
