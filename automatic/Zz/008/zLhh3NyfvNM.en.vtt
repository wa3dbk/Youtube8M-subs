00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.620
 like picking with a button 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.279
 you will need a line 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.279
 here I am using a line with a good color 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.720
 contrasting who enters can come 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.339
 and a button 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.380
 so come on 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 you pass 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.550
 the line with 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
 shows of your fabric 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 through the button hole 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 It was on the last day 15 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.790
 here an important tip because the trend 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.080
 We pull until it gets tight. 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.160
 now if the button gets too tight on the fabric you will never pass 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.600
 the house by ip 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 so my tip is that while you sew you leave your 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.050
 thumb 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.360
 in thesis the button and the fabric 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.550
 that is to let him me short with this space to be able to pass 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.720
 the house can still close the gate 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.300
 so you do 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 is overcoming once again 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 make the needle here with 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.820
 past strap with line through 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 of the fury of the button 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 if it's a four-hole personal button 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.450
 I repeated the operation more humble 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 then cpc overcomes here some three or four times that of land 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 is enough 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 not forgetting to leave the booth 5% each 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.800
 The woman is forward again. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.740
 but if it does not pass through the little hole it passes here behind 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:13.510
 who are you going to 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.679
 import 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 by the button about three turns 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.309
 What is she going to do here? 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.309
 Who calls the neck? 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.670
 and come to rely on a backward glance 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 the fabric 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.489
 here behind the fabric 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.029
 you will give 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.029
 no chile or simplex 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.889
 walkway forward said 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.719
 without going through the hole 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.709
 and here you give 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 another in its five days 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.829
 after a password from above 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.099
 already has price 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.779
 you cut the line 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.779
 I used to go to not have any leftovers 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.919
 your button is ready 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.789
 face pain hand 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.629
 I hope the tip is right. 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:31.579
 useful for you
