00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
a points in order to unlock these so
what<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> go<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.769> L<00:00:32.070> hook<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.700> use<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
what I go for is the L hook I use the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.850 
what I go for is the L hook I use the
alcohol<00:00:33.210> because<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> has<00:00:33.809> 3000<00:00:34.380> power<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
alcohol because it has 3000 power a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.889 
alcohol because it has 3000 power a
reload<00:00:35.430> speed<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.090> point<00:00:36.300> three<00:00:36.690> six

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
reload speed of one point three six

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
reload speed of one point three six
seconds<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.550> need<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> worry

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
seconds you don't really need to worry

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
seconds you don't really need to worry
about<00:00:39.329> capacity<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> great<00:00:40.469> piercing

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
about capacity and it is great piercing

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
about capacity and it is great piercing
the<00:00:41.280> reason<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.550> use<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> fire<00:00:42.300> rates<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the reason I use it is the fire rates a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.720 
the reason I use it is the fire rates a
lot<00:00:42.780> higher<00:00:43.020> than<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> other<00:00:44.070> magnums<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
lot higher than at the other magnums in

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
lot higher than at the other magnums in
the<00:00:44.820> game<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:45.600> other

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the game as you see there's other

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770 
the game as you see there's other
magnums<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> game<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.649> SN<00:00:47.160> W<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:48.539> has

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
magnums in the game like SN W which has

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
magnums in the game like SN W which has
a<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:49.050> higher<00:00:49.260> damage<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.399> fires<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> lot

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
a lot higher damage but it fires a lot

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
a lot higher damage but it fires a lot
slower<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.230> course<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> Smith<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
slower and of course at the Smith and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.260 
slower and of course at the Smith and
western<00:00:53.879> M<00:00:54.379> 500<00:00:55.379> which<00:00:55.829> has<00:00:56.070> massive<00:00:56.879> damage

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
western M 500 which has massive damage

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
western M 500 which has massive damage
but<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.469> three<00:00:59.010> rounds<00:00:59.699> off

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
but you can get about three rounds off

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.369 
but you can get about three rounds off
with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.090> l<00:01:00.210> hawk<00:01:00.449> by<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.230> you're

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
with the l hawk by the time that you're

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
with the l hawk by the time that you're
ready<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> fire<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> second<00:01:02.579> round<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.910> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
ready to fire a second round with this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
ready to fire a second round with this
so<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.530> makes<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> difference<00:01:04.920> with

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so it really makes the difference with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
so it really makes the difference with
the<00:01:05.339> alcohol<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.180> ten<00:01:06.360> multiple

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the alcohol if you can take ten multiple

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
the alcohol if you can take ten multiple
maggini<00:01:07.460> multiple<00:01:08.460> zombies<00:01:08.880> everything<00:01:09.570> okay

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
maggini multiple zombies everything okay

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.719 
maggini multiple zombies everything okay
so<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.650> second<00:01:11.010> thing<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.280> use<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so the second thing that I use is a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
so the second thing that I use is a
rifle<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> first<00:01:13.799> rifle

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
rifle now this because the first rifle

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
rifle now this because the first rifle
in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.220> game<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.520> absolutely<00:01:14.640> amazing<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
in the game is absolutely amazing you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
in the game is absolutely amazing you
don't<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.170> need<00:01:16.380> infinity<00:01:16.860> ammo<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
don't really need infinity ammo but it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
don't really need infinity ammo but it
is<00:01:17.580> recommended<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> use<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> regular

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
is recommended so I use this the regular

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
is recommended so I use this the regular
rifle<00:01:19.890> mm<00:01:20.580> damage<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:20.970> there's<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> lot<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rifle mm damage if there's a lot of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
rifle mm damage if there's a lot of
damage<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.990> great<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.380> taking<00:01:22.439> Rajini<00:01:23.070> out

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

do<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.979> need<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.369> an<00:01:32.640> affinity

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
do is you need to have an affinity

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
do is you need to have an affinity
rocket<00:01:33.390> launcher<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.869> repertoire

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
rocket launcher in your repertoire

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
rocket launcher in your repertoire
infinity<00:01:35.009> rocket<00:01:35.310> launcher<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.939> makes

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
infinity rocket launcher really makes

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.399 
infinity rocket launcher really makes
the<00:01:36.270> difference<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.900> parts<00:01:37.229> especially

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the difference in some parts especially

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
the difference in some parts especially
if<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:37.860> doing<00:01:37.950> speed<00:01:38.310> runs<00:01:38.549> where<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
if you're doing speed runs where you can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
if you're doing speed runs where you can
just<00:01:39.299> blast<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.990> area<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.100> really

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
just blast an area it's really really

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.649 
just blast an area it's really really
great<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.790> careful<00:01:42.210> where<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> fire<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
great but be careful where you fire it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.510 
great but be careful where you fire it
because<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> hit<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.619> partner<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.310> will

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
because if you hit your partner you will

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.740 
because if you hit your partner you will
kill<00:01:44.790> them<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.360> bleed<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.600> before

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
kill them and they will bleed out before

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.359 
kill them and they will bleed out before
the<00:01:46.110> time<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.799> them<00:01:47.100> I'm

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
professional they've data it super

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
professional they've data it super
quickly<00:01:49.140> within<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.740> second<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.220> two<00:01:50.280> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
quickly within about a second or two so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.280 
quickly within about a second or two so
you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> nearly<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:51.810> beside<00:01:52.140> your

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
you have to be nearly right beside your

partner<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> entire<00:01:53.189> time<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
partner the entire time if you want to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
partner the entire time if you want to
save<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.869> okay<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.680> last<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> shotgun

save them okay so the last is a shotgun

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
save them okay so the last is a shotgun
now<00:01:56.969> there's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.140> debate<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.740> between

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
now there's a bit of debate here between

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.179 
now there's a bit of debate here between
using<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.880> m3<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.990> Hydra<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> Hydra

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
using the m3 or the Hydra now the Hydra

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.260 
using the m3 or the Hydra now the Hydra
is<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.610> use<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> its

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
is what I like to use because of its

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
is what I like to use because of its
really<00:02:03.659> great<00:02:03.869> fire<00:02:04.110> rate<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.469> I'm<00:02:04.560> using<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
really great fire rate if I'm using a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
really great fire rate if I'm using a
shotguns<00:02:05.310> because<00:02:05.610> they're<00:02:05.759> too<00:02:05.939> close<00:02:06.210> not

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
shotguns because they're too close not

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.999 
shotguns because they're too close not
because<00:02:07.049> I'm<00:02:07.200> using<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.680> an<00:02:07.770> offensive

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
because I'm using it as an offensive

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.880 
because I'm using it as an offensive
weapon<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.929> Hydra<00:02:10.259> 550

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
weapon so as you see the Hydra 550

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
weapon so as you see the Hydra 550
firepower<00:02:11.400> okay<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> best<00:02:12.239> thing<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
firepower okay the best thing about it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.840 
firepower okay the best thing about it
is<00:02:13.020> even<00:02:13.500> though

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
is even though

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.970 
is even though
range<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.300> not<00:02:14.480> good<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.470> fact<00:02:15.710> that<00:02:15.800> it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
range is not good is the fact that it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.850 
range is not good is the fact that it
can<00:02:16.070> fire<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:16.550> after<00:02:17.090> another<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.110> has<00:02:18.830> a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
can fire one after another now it has a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.580 
can fire one after another now it has a
very<00:02:19.070> restricted<00:02:19.940> range<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.600> if<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.170> guys<00:02:21.350> are

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
very restricted range so if you guys are

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.190
