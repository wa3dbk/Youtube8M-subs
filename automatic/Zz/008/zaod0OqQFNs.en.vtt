00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.710
 ah 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello youtube friends today wins the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 angelito that will bring some video that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.220
 if it goes well they will not see the obvious that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.590
 if you are seeing it goes well and if not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 it will not come out 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.420
 is to wash clothes that I have here is for 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.290
 Yew does to throw them away since they do not 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.030
 it works a lot on its parts and giving that 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:36.239
 an internal component that is the drum 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.190
 those but because of the holes that they have 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.190
 these pushed inside out 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.080
 and the surface when celebrating is me 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.080
 it happened to give a lot 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 that transform this washing machine into a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.570
 giant cheese grater the radiator 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.250
 from the carrot dad what can be 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.610
 Ryan, that's why I'm going to try 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.720
 before we throw it away let's see now 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.570
 you have to make a few 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.550
 modifications that we are going to see and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.550
 then we will try it on cameras 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 for this I have here marked a window 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.270
 that we have to open in the housing of the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.790
 washing machine in the tank better said for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.940
 to be able to put here the element that we are going to 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.940
 fail 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.720
 and here we will talk a window with the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.730
 safety glasses I have the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.730
 ordinary glasses but these things 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.350
 i 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 ah 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.530
 good as the engine we do not have connected 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 live with a cable directly 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.490
 let's see if it works 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.540
 well now they will have to excuse the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:37.280
 noise but let's try to see how 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.280
 it works with a carrot 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.989
 now let's see 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.980
 here 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.920
 we can see what has been scratched 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.530
 is perfectly scratched now you can 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.970
 We can see this can be put together well 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.740
 because if there is a considerable amount 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.850
 to put this carrot we have 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.770
 striped as you could have seen can be 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.650
 still get a profit from these 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.140
 old artifacts and of course 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.010
 conditioner cleaning it well inside 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.370
 before making the grated but what 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.650
 power can be a little wit and 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.120
 imagination you can do these things 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.120
 I want to take advantage to send greetings 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.240
 and I love I get tired of mendoza 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.350
 who were in other videos 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.870
 commenting first that nobody and one for 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.510
 carlos ortega from mexico 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.659
 for this you are going to 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.920
 special cattle credit and mine 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:18.510
 own good friends I hope this 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.510
 some video is worth using 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.280
 if it's not useful, it's a bit new 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.100
 because I have not seen any of these from 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.560
 internet but when it was done like that here 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.610
 on camera with a calculation that I calculated that 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.200
 you could really can not it was 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.160
 tried out of camera everything has been done 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.140
 here so we could say that it goes like this 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.410
 that excuse the possibilities because 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.750
 It was all done in real time 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.540
 friends remember that in ghana the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.360
 angelito are going to be able to see many of these 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.640
 videos of all kinds homemade inventions 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.120
 magic tricks a physics experiment 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.120
 chemistry 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.790
 with electricity in all those things that 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.190
 they go around 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.970
 friends will be 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.970
 Until we meet again
