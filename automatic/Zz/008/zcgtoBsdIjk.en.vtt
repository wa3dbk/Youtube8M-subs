00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
so I'm gonna lean over here um someone

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.410 
so I'm gonna lean over here um someone

bypassing<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.320> buffering<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:12.559> cable

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
bypassing and buffering and cable

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.099 
bypassing and buffering and cable
capacitance<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.759> good<00:00:14.880> stuff<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.330> I'm

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
capacitance all that good stuff so I'm

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.140 
capacitance all that good stuff so I'm
going<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> basic<00:00:16.670> demonstration<00:00:17.670> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
going to do a basic demonstration of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.679 
going to do a basic demonstration of
that<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.330> guess<00:00:20.090> yeah<00:00:21.090> using<00:00:21.449> kind<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that I guess yeah using kind of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.990 
that I guess yeah using kind of
standards<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.380> i<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> board<00:00:23.789> I've

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
standards that i think on the board I've

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
standards that i think on the board I've
got<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.539> volume<00:00:25.260> pedal<00:00:27.380> about<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> volume<00:00:28.710> pedal

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
got a volume pedal about a volume pedal

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
got a volume pedal about a volume pedal
and<00:00:29.670> then<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:31.019> three<00:00:31.050> four<00:00:31.619> five<00:00:32.570> petals

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and then one two three four five petals

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.979 
and then one two three four five petals
that<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.840> true<00:00:33.989> bypass<00:00:35.510> monster<00:00:36.510> cables

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that are all true bypass monster cables

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.959 
that are all true bypass monster cables
about<00:00:37.800> 12<00:00:38.730> feet<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.000> length<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.420> either<00:00:40.050> side

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
about 12 feet in length on either side

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.920 
about 12 feet in length on either side
pretty<00:00:41.969> standard<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.750> gigging<00:00:43.680> situations

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
pretty standard for gigging situations

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.209 
pretty standard for gigging situations
yeah<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.200> mean<00:00:46.260> they're<00:00:46.440> good<00:00:46.559> quality<00:00:46.710> cables

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
yeah I mean they're good quality cables

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.660 
yeah I mean they're good quality cables
but<00:00:47.489> sometimes<00:00:48.739> doesn't<00:00:49.739> make<00:00:49.860> doesn't

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
but sometimes doesn't make doesn't

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
but sometimes doesn't make doesn't
matter<00:00:50.789> I've<00:00:51.449> got<00:00:51.600> labo<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.260> I've<00:00:52.530> got<00:00:52.739> lava

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
matter I've got labo that I've got lava

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.760 
matter I've got labo that I've got lava
cables<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> board<00:00:54.590> supposed<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
cables on the board supposed to that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
cables on the board supposed to that
supposed<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> help<00:00:56.190> too<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.670> we'll<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:56.969> right

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
supposed to help too but we'll see right

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.400 
supposed to help too but we'll see right
now<00:00:58.109> i'm<00:00:58.410> using<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> Telecaster<00:01:00.210> custom<00:01:00.629> right

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
now i'm using a Telecaster custom right

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.210 
now i'm using a Telecaster custom right
into<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.910> pathfinder<00:01:03.170> yeah<00:01:04.170> let's<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> base

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
into a pathfinder yeah let's do the base

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.990 
into a pathfinder yeah let's do the base
and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.880> i'll<00:01:05.970> run<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> treble<00:01:06.659> board

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:27.590 

ah

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.660 

so<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.720> was<00:01:28.870> straight<00:01:29.140> into<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.440> amp<00:01:29.670> these

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
so that was straight into the amp these

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.420 
so that was straight into the amp these
pedals<00:01:31.060> aren't<00:01:31.270> even<00:01:31.420> powered<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.430> true

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
pedals aren't even powered so true

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.370 
pedals aren't even powered so true
bypass<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:34.120> just<00:01:34.360> passing<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.810> signal<00:01:35.140> along

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
bypass it just passing a signal along

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.100 
bypass it just passing a signal along
through<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.770> switch<00:01:36.420> let's<00:01:37.420> unplug<00:01:37.900> from

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
through the switch let's unplug from

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.890 
through the switch let's unplug from
here<00:01:38.550> into<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:41.440> wine<00:01:41.650> pedal<00:01:41.980> jr.<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.850> then

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.840 

moving<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:46.990> mic<00:01:47.230> around<00:01:47.410> in<00:01:47.830> there<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
moving the mic around in there so this

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.850 
moving the mic around in there so this
is<00:01:51.880> through<00:01:52.270> all<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.450> pedals<00:01:52.810> all<00:01:53.590> true

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
is through all the pedals all true

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:14.200 
is through all the pedals all true
bypass

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.270 

so<00:02:15.210> definitely<00:02:15.510> some<00:02:16.110> high-end<00:02:16.770> roll<00:02:16.950> off<00:02:17.100> on

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so definitely some high-end roll off on

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.110 
so definitely some high-end roll off on
there<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.680> fix<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.640> few

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
there what can you to fix it a few

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.410 
there what can you to fix it a few
things<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:22.320> can<00:02:22.640> well<00:02:23.640> mainly<00:02:23.940> throw<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
things you can well mainly throw a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.540 
things you can well mainly throw a
buffer<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.870> there<00:02:25.050> everyone<00:02:25.710> put<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.400> such

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
buffer in there everyone put up such

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.770 
buffer in there everyone put up such
think<00:02:26.760> about<00:02:26.970> buffers<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.480> doesn't<00:02:27.750> know

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
think about buffers and doesn't know

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.910 
think about buffers and doesn't know
what<00:02:28.320> they're<00:02:28.440> talking<00:02:28.500> about<00:02:28.770> really<00:02:29.240> so

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
what they're talking about really so

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.640 
what they're talking about really so
let's<00:02:31.920> unplug<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:32.820> plug<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:36.380> innova<00:02:37.380> delay

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
let's unplug here plug in a innova delay

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.870 
let's unplug here plug in a innova delay
you<00:02:38.010> see<00:02:39.860> it's<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.130> bypassed<00:02:41.520> still

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
you see it's going to be bypassed still

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.290 
you see it's going to be bypassed still
they<00:02:42.810> uses<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.370> analog<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.880> digital<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.660> analog

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
they uses a analog to digital to analog

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.520 
they uses a analog to digital to analog
whatever<00:02:48.300> fridge<00:02:48.600> bypass<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.200> think<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.440> does

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
whatever fridge bypass I think it does

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:13.649 
whatever fridge bypass I think it does
quite<00:02:49.800> well<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.430> let's<00:02:50.610> try<00:02:50.970> that

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.520 

so<00:03:14.659> that<00:03:14.780> definitely<00:03:14.930> gets<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.290> lot<00:03:15.409> of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
so that definitely gets a lot of

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.940 
so that definitely gets a lot of
high-end<00:03:15.680> back<00:03:16.040> let's<00:03:16.489> compare<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
high-end back let's compare that to the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.670 
high-end back let's compare that to the
bass<00:03:19.189> sound<00:03:22.659> so<00:03:23.659> now<00:03:23.810> straight<00:03:24.170> into<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.439> amp

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
bass sound so now straight into the amp

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:38.590 
bass sound so now straight into the amp
again

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:04:03.750 

ah

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.760 

so<00:04:04.870> now<00:04:05.870> let's<00:04:06.050> go<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.260> something<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.650> little

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
so now let's go to something a little

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:27.190 
so now let's go to something a little
more<00:04:06.890> typical<00:04:09.700> let's<00:04:10.700> try<00:04:11.090> hold<00:04:11.420> up<00:04:11.540> second<00:04:26.200> so

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
more typical let's try hold up second so

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.060 
more typical let's try hold up second so
let's<00:04:27.710> try<00:04:28.010> boss<00:04:29.000> sd-1<00:04:29.510> it's<00:04:30.470> powered<00:04:30.860> it's

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
let's try boss sd-1 it's powered it's

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.870
