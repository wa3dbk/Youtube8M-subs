00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.360 
attention and eating hay and lounging
around<00:03:51.090> he<00:03:51.930> isn't<00:03:52.290> very<00:03:52.319> active<00:03:52.919> which<00:03:53.190> i

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
around he isn't very active which i

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.580 
around he isn't very active which i
assume<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.940> from<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.690> soreness<00:03:55.199> from<00:03:55.229> his

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
assume is from the soreness from his

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.479 
assume is from the soreness from his
behind<00:03:55.979> but<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.840> hopefully<00:03:58.409> I<00:03:58.620> will<00:03:59.069> be

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
behind but so hopefully I will be

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.960 
behind but so hopefully I will be
introducing<00:03:59.790> him<00:04:00.479> to<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:01.319> boys<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.519> don't<00:04:02.819> know

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
introducing him to my boys I don't know

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.030 
introducing him to my boys I don't know
how<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.299> going<00:04:03.479> to<00:04:03.540> work<00:04:03.599> out<00:04:03.840> exactly<00:04:04.040> if

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
how that's going to work out exactly if

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.369 
how that's going to work out exactly if
it<00:04:05.609> doesn't<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.150> may<00:04:06.359> have<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.079> know<00:04:07.169> think

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
it doesn't I may have to you know think

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.460 
it doesn't I may have to you know think
about<00:04:07.530> rehoming<00:04:08.129> him<00:04:08.489> but<00:04:09.180> hopefully<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.290> does

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
about rehoming him but hopefully it does

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.969 
about rehoming him but hopefully it does
work<00:04:10.709> out<00:04:10.919> even<00:04:11.609> if<00:04:11.699> it<00:04:11.790> takes<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.150> little<00:04:12.299> while

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
work out even if it takes a little while

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.500 
work out even if it takes a little while
since<00:04:13.979> I<00:04:14.190> do<00:04:14.250> really<00:04:14.549> like<00:04:14.729> him<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.180> think<00:04:15.389> he's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
cute as you can tell I love his coloring

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.860 
cute as you can tell I love his coloring
and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
and

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.180 
and
she<00:04:28.960> obviously<00:04:29.050> is<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.470> little<00:04:29.740> bit<00:04:29.830> camera<00:04:30.040> shy

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
she obviously is a little bit camera shy

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.950 
she obviously is a little bit camera shy
right<00:04:30.550> now<00:04:30.580> he<00:04:30.760> does<00:04:31.030> not<00:04:31.180> want<00:04:31.480> his<00:04:31.540> face<00:04:31.750> to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
right now he does not want his face to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.200 
right now he does not want his face to
be<00:04:32.080> on<00:04:32.230> camera<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:32.980> I<00:04:33.250> guess<00:04:33.670> that's<00:04:33.910> kind<00:04:34.180> of

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
be on camera so I guess that's kind of

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.690 
be on camera so I guess that's kind of
the<00:04:34.330> end<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.630> video<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:36.160> hope<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.550> guys
