00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.820 

so<00:00:02.850> here<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.060> have<00:00:03.120> blue<00:00:03.660> solar<00:00:03.990> past<00:00:04.230> die<00:00:04.529> I

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
so here I have blue solar past die I

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.799 
so here I have blue solar past die I
have<00:00:05.130> emptied<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:05.790> into<00:00:05.819> an<00:00:06.059> opaque<00:00:06.359> container

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:06.809 
have emptied it into an opaque container

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.360 
have emptied it into an opaque container
so<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.229> the<00:00:07.439> law<00:00:07.649> surrounding<00:00:08.189> light

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
so that the law surrounding light

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.760 
so that the law surrounding light
doesn't<00:00:08.580> expose<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.960> now<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
doesn't expose it and now I'm going to

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.610 
doesn't expose it and now I'm going to
add<00:00:11.400> some<00:00:12.090> solar<00:00:12.510> fast<00:00:12.810> thickener<00:00:13.350> a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
add some solar fast thickener a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.910 
add some solar fast thickener a
thickener<00:00:14.550> will<00:00:14.730> allow<00:00:15.570> me<00:00:15.840> to<00:00:16.289> screen<00:00:16.710> print

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
thickener will allow me to screen print

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.319 
thickener will allow me to screen print
the<00:00:19.009> will<00:00:20.009> allow<00:00:20.189> me<00:00:20.339> to<00:00:20.369> screen<00:00:20.789> print<00:00:20.999> the

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:21.329 
the will allow me to screen print the

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.870 
the will allow me to screen print the
dye<00:00:21.949> it's<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.159> important<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.519> take<00:00:23.699> all

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
dye it's really important to take all

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.810 
dye it's really important to take all
these<00:00:24.089> up<00:00:24.269> they<00:00:24.390> all<00:00:24.539> aren't<00:00:24.839> in<00:00:24.929> solution<00:00:25.439> so

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
these up they all aren't in solution so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
these up they all aren't in solution so
give<00:00:26.820> them<00:00:26.909> evenly<00:00:27.300> dispersed<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.650> really

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
give them evenly dispersed you really

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.020 
give them evenly dispersed you really
want<00:00:29.069> to<00:00:29.159> hear<00:00:29.339> that<00:00:29.550> ball<00:00:29.730> take<00:00:29.970> inside

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

fools

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.910 

this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.800> an<00:00:43.890> entire<00:00:44.280> four<00:00:45.239> ounce<00:00:45.450> bottle<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this is an entire four ounce bottle that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
this is an entire four ounce bottle that
I<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> opaque<00:00:47.879> container<00:00:48.500> about<00:00:49.500> two

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I put in this opaque container about two

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.530 
I put in this opaque container about two
and<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> half<00:00:49.860> capfuls<00:00:52.220> thick<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:54.360> couldn't

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
and a half capfuls thick you couldn't

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.819 
and a half capfuls thick you couldn't
adjust<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.110> depending<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.620> what

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
adjust that depending on what

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.890 
adjust that depending on what
consistency<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.420> screen<00:00:57.690> print<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
consistency you like to screen print I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.609 
consistency you like to screen print I
know<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:00.930> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> shake<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.409> up<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:04.440> more

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
know I want to shake this up the more

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
know I want to shake this up the more
you<00:01:04.680> shake<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> thicker<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> gets<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> can

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you shake it the thicker it gets you can

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.480 
you shake it the thicker it gets you can
let<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.140> sit<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.740> while<00:01:07.920> too<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
let it sit a little while too if you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.590 
let it sit a little while too if you
want<00:01:09.170> thicken<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.539> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
want thicken up a little more now it's a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.249 
want thicken up a little more now it's a
good<00:01:15.750> screen<00:01:16.140> printing<00:01:16.530> consistency<00:01:18.259> this

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
good screen printing consistency this

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.389 
good screen printing consistency this
could<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.740> thin<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:20.190> like

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
could be a little thin but I like

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.850 
could be a little thin but I like
printing<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> thick<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:22.410> coolest<00:01:22.740> thing

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
printing it thick the coolest thing

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.889 
printing it thick the coolest thing
about<00:01:22.890> screen<00:01:23.460> printing<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.179> solar<00:01:24.450> fast<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
about screen printing the solar fast is

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.810 
about screen printing the solar fast is
that<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> double<00:01:25.560> exposure<00:01:25.860> I'm<00:01:26.640> gonna

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that you get a double exposure I'm gonna

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.120 
that you get a double exposure I'm gonna
print<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.210> brain<00:01:27.690> on<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.170> shirt<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:29.039> I'm

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
print this brain on this shirt but I'm

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
print this brain on this shirt but I'm
also<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.729> able<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.179> once<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
also going to be able to put in once I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.389 
also going to be able to put in once I
have<00:01:31.080> that<00:01:31.259> put<00:01:31.530> down<00:01:31.679> I<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.950> put<00:01:32.130> another

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
have that put down I can put another

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.090 
have that put down I can put another
image<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.970> top<00:01:33.179> of<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.740> that's<00:01:34.740> kind<00:01:35.070> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
image on top of that that's kind of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.980 
image on top of that that's kind of
difficult<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.640> visualize<00:01:36.179> so<00:01:36.570> we're<00:01:36.960> just

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
difficult to visualize so we're just

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
difficult to visualize so we're just
gonna<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.399> what<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> result<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.179 

got<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.630> brain<00:01:54.960> printed<00:01:55.469> I'm<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.070> this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
got my brain printed I'm gonna put this

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.660 
got my brain printed I'm gonna put this
negative<00:01:57.110> up<00:01:58.110> an<00:01:58.590> eyeball<00:01:59.039> over<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.490> whole

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
negative up an eyeball over the whole

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.719 
negative up an eyeball over the whole
thing<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:01.920> should<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.220> an<00:02:02.340> eyeball

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
thing so we should get an eyeball

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:20.819 
thing so we should get an eyeball
printed<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.299> top<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.720> brain

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.460 

there<00:02:21.829> we<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.720> really<00:02:23.720> see<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.989> brain<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
there we go really see the brain this

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.390 
there we go really see the brain this
time<00:02:24.739> now<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.459> can<00:02:26.060> put<00:02:26.870> my<00:02:27.040> secondary<00:02:28.040> image

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
time now I can put my secondary image

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.479 
time now I can put my secondary image
down<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:29.360> top<00:02:29.599> of<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.950> going<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.159> use<00:02:31.280> this

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
down on top of it I'm going to use this

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:40.339 
down on top of it I'm going to use this
Miro<00:02:31.819> painting

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.140 

the<00:02:40.829> area<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.219> photo<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.640> was<00:02:41.700> really

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the area of the photo that was really

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.550 
the area of the photo that was really
dark<00:02:42.360> kept<00:02:42.719> it<00:02:42.870> almost<00:02:43.200> white<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.269> this

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
dark kept it almost white and this

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.020 
dark kept it almost white and this
eyeball<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.859> looks<00:02:47.069> really<00:02:47.459> weird<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.909> get

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
eyeball so it looks really weird you get

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.149 
eyeball so it looks really weird you get
that<00:02:48.180> double<00:02:48.780> image<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.290> it's<00:02:49.409> hard<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.950> tell

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
that double image and it's hard to tell

00:02:50.159 --> 00:03:33.790 
that double image and it's hard to tell
exactly<00:02:50.219> what's<00:02:50.849> going<00:02:51.120> on

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.050 

this<00:03:34.340> is<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.700> brain<00:03:35.420> printing<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:35.930> did

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
this is the brain printing I did

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.550 
this is the brain printing I did
the<00:03:37.209> mural<00:03:37.780> painting<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.680> put<00:03:38.920> over<00:03:39.190> top<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.400> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the mural painting we put over top of it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.350 
the mural painting we put over top of it
we<00:03:40.620> take<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.920> glass<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.610> transparency

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
we take the glass and the transparency

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:51.250 
we take the glass and the transparency
of

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.170 

so<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.860> get<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.099> really<00:03:52.159> cool<00:03:52.760> double

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
so you get that really cool double

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.130 
so you get that really cool double
exposure<00:03:53.569> look

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
exposure look

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:41.770 
exposure look
powerful<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:57.150> best<00:03:57.330> ways<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.570> do

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:55.230 

nice<00:04:42.780> that's<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.710> purple<00:04:44.069> hand<00:04:44.280> by<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.849> end

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.320 

that's<00:04:55.840> your<00:04:56.110> brain<00:04:59.669> so<00:05:00.669> this<00:05:00.850> one<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.030> did<00:05:01.210> by

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
that's your brain so this one I did by

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.150 
that's your brain so this one I did by
hand<00:05:01.360> tonight<00:05:01.710> with<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.889> I<00:05:03.330> put<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
hand tonight with the I put the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.960 
hand tonight with the I put the
transparency<00:05:06.160> down<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.580> put<00:05:06.759> an<00:05:06.849> outline

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
transparency down and put an outline

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.570 
transparency down and put an outline
around<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.780> with<00:05:07.960> pencil<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.650> then<00:05:09.520> I

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
around it with pencil and then I

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.700 
around it with pencil and then I
actually<00:05:09.819> filled<00:05:10.270> in<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:10.660> area<00:05:10.930> by<00:05:11.139> hand<00:05:11.410> it's

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
actually filled in the area by hand it's

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.620 
actually filled in the area by hand it's
a<00:05:11.770> lot<00:05:11.979> it's<00:05:12.520> almost<00:05:12.729> exactly<00:05:12.910> like<00:05:13.330> doing<00:05:13.569> the

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
a lot it's almost exactly like doing the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.200 
a lot it's almost exactly like doing the
screen<00:05:13.900> printing<00:05:14.229> process<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.910> this<00:05:16.030> gives

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
screen printing process and this gives

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.700 
screen printing process and this gives
you<00:05:16.300> a<00:05:16.360> cool<00:05:16.599> effect<00:05:16.690> it's<00:05:17.110> like<00:05:17.259> a<00:05:17.289> it's<00:05:17.620> like

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
you a cool effect it's like a it's like

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.219 
you a cool effect it's like a it's like
a<00:05:17.860> cutout<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.460> person's<00:05:19.000> face<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.960> this<00:05:20.110> is

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
a cutout of the person's face so this is

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:45.500 
a cutout of the person's face so this is
Alfred<00:05:20.500> Hitchcock

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:06:05.710 

well<00:05:46.020> exhaustion

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.130 

the<00:06:06.530> hotter<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.830> water<00:06:06.950> the<00:06:07.690> better<00:06:08.690> washing

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
the hotter the water the better washing

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.380 
the hotter the water the better washing
the<00:06:09.800> unreactive<00:06:10.430> that<00:06:10.580> washes<00:06:10.970> out<00:06:11.120> in<00:06:11.300> the

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
the unreactive that washes out in the

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:40.239 
the unreactive that washes out in the
cleaner<00:06:11.630> your<00:06:11.900> print<00:06:12.170> will<00:06:12.260> be<00:06:12.380> overall

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.309
