00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 You wash all over the world. 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.980
 You are the video of today make it for you. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.110
 I'm very hesitant, I still have to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.500
 take a look at what I buy because 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:19.920
 Actually two euros here in norway is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.529
 stands 16 cross of 55 cents and 16 crowns 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.630
 I am practically nothing 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.310
 but I'll try to buy something 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 that maybe I could be driving through 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 snake a butter the postcard 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.620
 using less quantity I'll see how 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620
 do 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:03.930
 is and is having to buy is something that is 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 tasty but very cheap and for you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.330
 to have a notion more or less like this of 3 - 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.330
 and let's put each value in Brazil 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.660
 You multiply by three, we'll have more. 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 or less an idea here of the sand what 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.289
 buy 20 chronicles 20 crowns 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.720
 in the case 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:39.170
 I bought 2003 50 each 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 I also bought these cookies here. 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:54.090
 are very healthy and they liked 7 one 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.460
 then the person who bought the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.360
 cheaper brand that had the same brand 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.150
 of the market and what I did 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.680
 are 400 grams and that it butter 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.610
 posted 9 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.920
 so I did a song in the head is 100 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.280
 grams a case I put two cross and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.739
 two of a little something 100 grams pro 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.540
 whole package because it is used very little 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.380
 of butter and in the case as fruit is what 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.910
 I like to do 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.690
 Here is an example more or less to 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.420
 you see the tell if can put the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.010
 hand you put the fruit has to put 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.120
 the model has to put in that then goes 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.450
 in your choice 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:43.519
 so in short, this is the biscuit 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.519
 the butter is a movie 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.209
 I'll stay here for butter 9 then 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.840
 putting 100 grams would be more or 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:01.049
 least a couple cross and something which 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:05.459
 I bought 23 57 in here the rubin that is the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.660
 Cookie gave 7 70 nÃ© then putting 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.760
 more or less 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.770
 gave basically the two euros 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.920
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.780
 I build very simple but here it is well 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.910
 hard to do to buy things 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.760
 because here we win well then 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.410
 money from here but if you do the comparison 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.780
 the difference is quite expensive 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.610
 so I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.400
