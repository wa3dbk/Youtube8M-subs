London<00:00:07.050> will<00:00:07.170> started<00:00:07.620> out<00:00:07.770> as<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.670> venture

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
London will started out as a venture

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.869 
London will started out as a venture
that<00:00:09.420> tied<00:00:10.020> in<00:00:10.380> my<00:00:10.740> background<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.520> animal

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
that tied in my background in animal

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.450 
that tied in my background in animal
science<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.629> was<00:00:13.500> really<00:00:13.800> interested<00:00:14.130> in

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
science I was really interested in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.850 
science I was really interested in
raising<00:00:14.670> animals<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:16.200> non-traditional

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
raising animals in a non-traditional

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.200 
raising animals in a non-traditional
fashion<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.020> decided<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.970> producing<00:00:20.970> wool

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
fashion I decided that producing wool

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.920 
fashion I decided that producing wool
would<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.350> method<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.310> me<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.760> run<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> no

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
would be a method for me to run a no

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
would be a method for me to run a no
kill<00:00:25.230> no<00:00:25.500> cell<00:00:25.770> facility<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.060> that's<00:00:27.210> what

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
kill no cell facility and so that's what

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.120 
kill no cell facility and so that's what
we<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.019> animals<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.920> life

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we do here the animals are here for life

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130 
we do here the animals are here for life
and<00:00:29.340> they're<00:00:29.490> producing<00:00:30.060> fiber<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and they're producing fiber that that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.880 
and they're producing fiber that that
we're<00:00:31.380> able<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.790> product<00:00:33.650> we<00:00:34.650> have<00:00:34.680> a
