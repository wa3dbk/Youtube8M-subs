there<00:00:04.589> are<00:00:04.710> two<00:00:04.859> things<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.220> make<00:00:05.460> fitting

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
there are two things that make fitting

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.430 
there are two things that make fitting
shutters<00:00:06.210> simple<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.810> will<00:00:07.049> give<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.319> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
shutters simple and will give you the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.110 
shutters simple and will give you the
confidence<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:08.040> order<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.639> fit<00:00:09.000> them

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
confidence to order and fit them

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.570 
confidence to order and fit them
yourself<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:10.230> first<00:00:10.530> are<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.130> easy<00:00:11.280> fit

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
yourself the first are the easy fit

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580 
yourself the first are the easy fit
frames<00:00:11.940> they<00:00:12.840> allow<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> shutters<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
frames they allow the shutters and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.129 
frames they allow the shutters and
frames<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.280> fitted<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:15.030> unit<00:00:15.450> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
frames to be fitted as one unit this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.689 
frames to be fitted as one unit this
saves<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.560> messing<00:00:16.859> around<00:00:16.949> trying<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.520> fit

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
saves you messing around trying to fit

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.340 
saves you messing around trying to fit
the<00:00:17.789> frames<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.300> window<00:00:18.690> or<00:00:18.840> wall<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the frames to the window or wall and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.050 
the frames to the window or wall and
then<00:00:19.800> wondering<00:00:20.250> why<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> shutters<00:00:20.850> don't

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
then wondering why the shutters don't

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140 
then wondering why the shutters don't
fit<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.470> second<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> call<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> shadow

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
fit the second is what I call the shadow

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.839 
fit the second is what I call the shadow
gap<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:25.230> shadow<00:00:25.470> gap<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> clearance<00:00:26.550> gap

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
gap the shadow gap is the clearance gap

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
gap the shadow gap is the clearance gap
left<00:00:27.420> between<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> window<00:00:28.199> recess<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.949> the

shutter frame this shadow gap allows for

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
shutter frame this shadow gap allows for
the<00:00:31.949> walls<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> level<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.390> any

gap is the neatest and easiest way to
fit<00:01:18.270> shutters<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:19.320> creates<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.799> professional

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
fit shutters it creates a professional

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
fit shutters it creates a professional

finish and draws your eye to the square
shutter<00:01:23.070> frame<00:01:23.369> rather<00:01:24.030> than<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> wonky

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
shutter frame rather than the wonky

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
shutter frame rather than the wonky
window<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.610> makes<00:01:26.820> fitting

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
window and this is what makes fitting

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
window and this is what makes fitting
shutters<00:01:27.630> yourself<00:01:28.049> easy<00:01:28.970> we<00:01:29.970> generally

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
shutters yourself easy we generally

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600 
shutters yourself easy we generally
leave<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> 5<00:01:31.020> mil<00:01:31.320> shadow<00:01:31.619> gap<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.130> around<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
leave a 5 mil shadow gap all around the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
leave a 5 mil shadow gap all around the
frame<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:33.930> using<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> smallest

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
frame because you're using the smallest

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219 
frame because you're using the smallest
sizes<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.060> larger<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:36.780> cases

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sizes this can be larger in some cases

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
sizes this can be larger in some cases
but<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.829> long<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> check<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.610> measuring

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
but as long as you check your measuring

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
but as long as you check your measuring
ensure<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> width<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> height<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> right

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
ensure the width and height at the right

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.219 
ensure the width and height at the right
way<00:01:41.220> around<00:01:41.369> you'll<00:01:42.210> find<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.570> shutters<00:01:42.930> slip

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
way around you'll find the shutters slip

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.910 
way around you'll find the shutters slip
easily<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.009> place<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.320> measuring<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
easily into place the measuring and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
easily into place the measuring and
design<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:47.970> important<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
design are very important for a
