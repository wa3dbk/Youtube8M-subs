00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.290
 good night as expected this Saturday has passed 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.320
 stable quiet with a lot of sun and with day temperatures somewhat lower than 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.049
 yesterday's 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.269
 in fact the maxims have been placed around the 30 degrees leave behind 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.890
 the more than 35 that reach us in the last days imitations a 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.019
 we focus our attention on this slight decrease in temperatures in the north 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.050
 the squalls and the storms are doing the day's protagonists in 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.329
 these images we can appreciate how they have been forming their cloudy nuclei 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.400
 that have caused storms the areas of greater importance to which we must add the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.780
 arrival east in front of the cox nancy that has crept into the peninsula although all 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.519
 points out that at least here in Andalusia the situation will not change 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.690
 too much tomorrow sunday will again dominate the clear skies and that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.180
 sunny atmosphere we will wake up with morning mists in the strait in the 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.649
 littoral reiterate and closer and the vicinity of the Guadalquivir Valley 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.420
 In the afternoon, our concert will be developed again in the Sierras del 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 north and east of the region with possible storms at the extreme 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.389
 more oriental 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.089
 the winds will blow variable or of western component in general of little 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.520
 intensity and with breezes on the Mediterranean coast and so we have a week 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.540
 to start another that will come again marked by falls on Monday 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.430
 The sun will shine in skies that are not cloudy or clear only in the 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:18.609
 Mediterranean coastline 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.270
 we will have some cloudy intervals in the afternoon will return to 

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.689
 form return clouds but you are always alone in the northeastern mountains 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.840
 where the possibility of an isolated storm is not ruled out 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.380
 the winds one more day will operate loose or variable west component 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.720
 with breezes on the coast and if we take a look at the thermometers during 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.979
 next days we will see that they will not suffer important changes tomorrow they can be 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.710
 register a couple of degrees less in the provinces of huelva and cádiz but not 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.280
 It will be until Wednesday when temperatures begin to rise 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.420
 again in all of Andalusia for the moment tonight the minimum will return to 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.280
 around 20 degrees and maximum tomorrow will be around 30 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.140
 except in Granada where they could reach 35 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.010
 as for the ahmar tomorrow will be a day of transition of changes in the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.570
 waters to the anti-Castro mood 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.040
 with a breeze regime and with a swell blowing in the rest of the sectors 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.360
 weak winds ibar and avilés also with tide prevailing in it in 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.309
 the narrow the moderate west with swell 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.429
 and as regards the rest of Spain, the environment will continue to be 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.089
 unstable in the tc in the northern third peninsular 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.749
 with moderate showers that will be accompanied by a storm that may be 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.600
 locally strong in the north of Navarre and in Aragon 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.850
 in the remaining in the morning the cloudy skies will predominate 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.870
 In the afternoon, clouds of evolution will form in mountain systems 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 from the interior even the Iberian central system are expected showers and 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.010
 storms that will spread to the interior of the Valencian community we will go towards 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.090
 the temperatures on the other hand will rise slightly in the peninsular southeast and 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.300
 more markedly in the Balearic Islands at the moment has been everything to have a happy 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.590
 night and until tomorrow
