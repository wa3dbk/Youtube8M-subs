00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
simple continuity tester and then we're

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.040 
simple continuity tester and then we're
going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.460> use<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.940> we're<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:31.020> to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
going to use that we're just going to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.870 
going to use that we're just going to
put<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.710> there<00:03:31.950> hold<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.460> on<00:03:32.580> with<00:03:32.730> our

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
put that on there hold it on with our

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.130 
put that on there hold it on with our
hand<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.930> touch<00:03:34.970> we<00:03:35.970> have<00:03:36.090> no<00:03:36.270> light<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.990> we

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
hand and touch we have no light so we

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.140 
hand and touch we have no light so we
know<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.440> don't<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.830> short<00:03:38.190> we<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:38.970> put

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
know we don't have a short we can put

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.360 
know we don't have a short we can put
the<00:03:39.300> second<00:03:39.690> end<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.710> is<00:03:40.920> step<00:03:41.130> eight

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
the second end on and that is step eight

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.400 
the second end on and that is step eight
is<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.790> put<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> second<00:03:42.450> end<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.990> in<00:03:43.290> this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
is to put the second end on and in this

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.850 
is to put the second end on and in this
case<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.430> straight<00:03:45.120> plug<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:46.770> we're

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
case it is a straight plug so we're

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.720 
case it is a straight plug so we're
going<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.010> go<00:03:47.130> ahead<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.430> we're<00:03:47.550> going<00:03:47.640> to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
going to go ahead and we're going to

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.770 
going to go ahead and we're going to
slide<00:03:48.000> our<00:03:48.180> cap<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.760> repeat<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.540> steps

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
slide our cap on and repeat the steps

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:09.350 
slide our cap on and repeat the steps
that<00:03:52.110> we<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.260> did

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.270 

with<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> straight<00:04:10.870> plug<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.740> important

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
with a straight plug it is important

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.390 
with a straight plug it is important
that<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.820> braids<00:04:13.270> be<00:04:14.110> bent<00:04:14.440> over<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.980> end<00:04:15.190> of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
that the braids be bent over the end of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.720 
that the braids be bent over the end of
the<00:04:15.520> sleeve<00:04:15.850> so<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:16.930> forms<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.440> hook

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
the sleeve so this forms a hook

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:48.210 
the sleeve so this forms a hook
preventing<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:19.030> cable<00:04:19.480> from<00:04:19.600> pulling<00:04:20.049> out

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.660 

and<00:04:48.540> now<00:04:49.540> we<00:04:49.600> have<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> completed<00:04:50.500> cable<00:04:50.950> part

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
and now we have a completed cable part

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.910 
and now we have a completed cable part
of<00:04:51.790> step<00:04:52.030> 8<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.420> doing<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.900> final<00:04:53.320> test<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.800> the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
of step 8 is doing a final test on the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.790 
of step 8 is doing a final test on the
cable<00:04:54.310> we<00:04:54.970> can<00:04:55.180> do<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.570> using<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.560> cable

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
cable we can do this using a cable

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.570 
cable we can do this using a cable
tester<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.720> continuity<00:04:58.720> tester<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.580> multimeter

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
going to use a cable tester we're going

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.390 
going to use a cable tester we're going
to<00:05:04.960> plug<00:05:05.170> it<00:05:05.350> in<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:05.710> check<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.220> make<00:05:06.370> sure

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
to plug it in and check it to make sure
