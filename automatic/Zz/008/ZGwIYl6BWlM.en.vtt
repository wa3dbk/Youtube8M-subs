00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
about basically the stratum and my

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.790 
about basically the stratum and my
opinions<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:06.930> far<00:00:07.580> I've<00:00:08.580> had<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.800> I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
opinions on it so far I've had it for I

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.029 
opinions on it so far I've had it for I
think<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.340> day<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.110> in<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.440> filled<00:00:14.280> tank<00:00:15.020> but<00:00:16.039> so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
think a day now in a filled tank but so

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
think a day now in a filled tank but so
far<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.730> haven't<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.390> able<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.720> find<00:00:19.020> any

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
far like I haven't been able to find any

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.410 
far like I haven't been able to find any
negatives<00:00:20.100> with<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.210> good

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
negatives with it like that's how good

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.950 
negatives with it like that's how good
it<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.380> opinion<00:00:23.480> when<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.720> reading

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it is in my opinion when I was reading

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.019 
it is in my opinion when I was reading
about<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.380> researching<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:28.010> it<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.340> read

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
about it and researching it it I read

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
about it and researching it it I read
that<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.779> gonna<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.349> light<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.369> was

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
that it was gonna be really light it was

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.990 
that it was gonna be really light it was
gonna<00:00:32.669> crumble<00:00:32.969> real<00:00:33.270> easily<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.910> what<00:00:35.910> was

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
gonna crumble real easily and what was

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.110 
gonna crumble real easily and what was
the<00:00:36.090> other<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:39.390> forgot<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> other<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the other one I forgot the other one but

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
the other one I forgot the other one but
upon<00:00:42.120> filling<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.320> good<00:00:43.469> cloud<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
upon filling it it was good cloud the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.869 
upon filling it it was good cloud the
tank<00:00:44.300> when<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> feel<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> look<00:00:47.760> at

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
tank when you feel it and if you look at

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
tank when you feel it and if you look at
the<00:00:47.969> last<00:00:48.120> video<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.780> clearly<00:00:49.020> did<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.440> cloud

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the last video it clearly did not cloud

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
the last video it clearly did not cloud
the<00:00:49.950> tank<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:53.780> hasn't<00:00:54.780> crumbled

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the tank at all and it hasn't crumbled

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
the tank at all and it hasn't crumbled
even<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.370> planning<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> planted<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
even from planning when I planted the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.979 
even from planning when I planted the
plants<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.949> sunk<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.750> it<00:01:00.750> was

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
plants they just sunk right in it was

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
plants they just sunk right in it was
also<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.590> read<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.039> too<00:01:02.219> light<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
also I read it would be too light to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
also I read it would be too light to
plant<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> plants<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.480> more<00:01:04.439> lighter<00:01:04.650> than

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
plant the plants in more lighter than

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.600 
plant the plants in more lighter than
most<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.250> I'd<00:01:05.339> say<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.909> light<00:01:06.500> but

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
most and I'd say it is it's light but

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.170 
most and I'd say it is it's light but
definitely<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.909> still<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:10.049> plant<00:01:10.320> plants<00:01:10.740> in

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
definitely you still can plant plants in

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
definitely you still can plant plants in
even<00:01:12.180> Crips<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.290> Crips<00:01:13.830> were<00:01:13.920> really

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
even Crips and the Crips were really

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.469 
even Crips and the Crips were really
easy<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.700> mainly<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> ones<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.390> were

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
easy it was mainly the ones that were

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.640 
easy it was mainly the ones that were
behind<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> rocks<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> hard

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
behind the rocks that are kind of hard

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.880 
behind the rocks that are kind of hard
to<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.990> mean<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> big

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to get to but I mean really not that big

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.550 
to get to but I mean really not that big
of<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> problem<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.780> those<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> first

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
of a problem so those are the the first

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.800 
of a problem so those are the the first
signs<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.450> today<00:01:25.040> even<00:01:26.040> growth<00:01:26.810> if

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
signs and then now today even growth if

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.039 
signs and then now today even growth if
you<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.229> last<00:01:28.380> video<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.009> Cabala

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
you look at my last video this Cabala

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.730 
you look at my last video this Cabala
was<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.790> down<00:01:32.790> under<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:34.560> already

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
was like down under there and it already

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.630 
was like down under there and it already
grew<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.000> crazy<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.490> can

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
grew which is really crazy in you can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.899 
grew which is really crazy in you can
see<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.240> grown<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.460> rotala<00:01:41.460> which

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
see it's grown a little bit rotala which

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.550 
see it's grown a little bit rotala which
did<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.299> grow<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> dirt<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:42.990> stems

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
did not grow in the dirt that stems

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
did not grow in the dirt that stems
around<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.979> could<00:01:44.100> already<00:01:44.220> tell<00:01:44.509> this<00:01:46.399> louia<00:01:47.689> a

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
around I could already tell this louia a

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.719 
around I could already tell this louia a
narrow<00:01:49.259> leaf<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.000> there

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
narrow leaf if you can see it back there

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.120 
narrow leaf if you can see it back there
there<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.850> go

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
there we go

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.760 
there we go
the<00:01:56.130> top<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.670> sent<00:01:56.969> out<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.390> few<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.869> crowns<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the top it sent out a few more crowns I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.270 
the top it sent out a few more crowns I
guess<00:01:58.890> you'd<00:01:59.040> say<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.280> believes<00:02:00.890> new<00:02:01.890> leaf<00:02:02.100> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
guess you'd say I believes new leaf on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.520 
guess you'd say I believes new leaf on
the<00:02:02.399> high<00:02:02.640> grow<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.820> guy<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> the

it<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.549> they're<00:02:17.730> already<00:02:17.909> bouncing<00:02:18.599> back

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
it is and they're already bouncing back

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.210 
it is and they're already bouncing back
and<00:02:18.959> growing

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and growing

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.880 
and growing
I<00:02:20.280> mean<00:02:20.670> roots<00:02:21.510> coming<00:02:22.019> down<00:02:22.230> from<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.590> Matala

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
I mean roots coming down from the Matala

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.270 
I mean roots coming down from the Matala
into<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.579> stratum<00:02:24.000> already<00:02:24.829> crazy<00:02:25.829> stuff<00:02:26.250> man

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
into the stratum already crazy stuff man

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.410 
into the stratum already crazy stuff man
I<00:02:26.579> mean<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:29.220> new<00:02:29.459> growth<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.239> think

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
I mean that's new growth on the I think

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.729 
I mean that's new growth on the I think
it's<00:02:30.599> Osteria<00:02:31.079> yeah<00:02:31.920> wisteria<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:33.299> new

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
it's Osteria yeah wisteria that's new

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.289 
it's Osteria yeah wisteria that's new
that's<00:02:34.739> all<00:02:34.890> older<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.849> can<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.120> that's

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
that's all older and you can see that's

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.089 
that's all older and you can see that's
a<00:02:36.420> smaller<00:02:36.659> leaf<00:02:36.930> right<00:02:37.170> there<00:02:37.379> that's<00:02:37.769> new<00:02:38.069> I

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
a smaller leaf right there that's new I

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.240 
a smaller leaf right there that's new I
mean<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.599> can't<00:02:40.170> say<00:02:40.829> enough<00:02:41.069> about

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
mean I'm just I can't say enough about

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.740 
mean I'm just I can't say enough about
this<00:02:41.609> stuff<00:02:41.849> I'm<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.629> impressed

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
this stuff I'm just really impressed

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.399 
this stuff I'm just really impressed
with<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.909> nano<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.750> totally

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
with it and if you have a nano I totally

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.559 
with it and if you have a nano I totally
recommend<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.920> stuff<00:02:47.129> for<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> big<00:02:48.000> tank

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
recommend this stuff for a big tank

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.500 
recommend this stuff for a big tank
I<00:02:48.599> myself<00:02:49.560> probably<00:02:50.069> wouldn't<00:02:50.519> get<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.879> just

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
I myself probably wouldn't get it just

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.180 
I myself probably wouldn't get it just
because<00:02:51.659> it's<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.019> expensive<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.769> big<00:02:52.950> tank

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
because it's so expensive for a big tank

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.000 
because it's so expensive for a big tank
but<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.659> stuff<00:02:54.959> ten<00:02:55.530> bucks<00:02:55.739> for<00:02:55.829> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
but you can this stuff ten bucks for the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.610 
but you can this stuff ten bucks for the
substrate<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.970> planted<00:02:57.299> tank<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:58.349> really

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
substrate in a planted tank you really

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.910 
substrate in a planted tank you really
can't<00:02:58.889> beat<00:02:59.159> that<00:02:59.780> as<00:03:00.780> far<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.109> price<00:03:01.319> goes<00:03:01.349> in

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
can't beat that as far as price goes in

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.440 
can't beat that as far as price goes in
my<00:03:02.099> opinion<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.889> I<00:03:04.889> mean<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.730> get<00:03:05.909> four<00:03:06.299> five

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
my opinion and I mean you get four five

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.759 
my opinion and I mean you get four five
gallon<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:07.049> got<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:09.019> what<00:03:10.019> was<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.349> on<00:03:10.590> let<00:03:10.709> me

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
gallon I got the what was it on let me

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.849 
gallon I got the what was it on let me
pull<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.159> bag<00:03:11.340> right<00:03:11.639> here<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:13.590> four

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
pull up the bag right here the four

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.119 
pull up the bag right here the four
point<00:03:14.069> four<00:03:14.280> pound<00:03:14.519> bag<00:03:15.530> for<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> ten<00:03:16.739> get<00:03:16.980> or

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
point four pound bag for a ten get or

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.849 
point four pound bag for a ten get or
five<00:03:17.549> gallon<00:03:17.879> right<00:03:17.970> here<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.810> I've<00:03:19.109> got<00:03:19.139> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
five gallon right here and I've got and

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.180 
five gallon right here and I've got and
that's<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> front<00:03:21.410> I've<00:03:22.410> got<00:03:22.889> plenty

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that's just in the front I've got plenty

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's just in the front I've got plenty
of<00:03:25.519> substrate<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.639> here<00:03:26.879> so<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.299> mean<00:03:27.660> that's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
of substrate in here so I mean that's

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.379 
of substrate in here so I mean that's
pretty<00:03:28.560> much<00:03:28.680> my<00:03:28.949> first<00:03:29.459> thoughts<00:03:29.819> on<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.209> just

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
pretty much my first thoughts on it just

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.110 
pretty much my first thoughts on it just
amazing<00:03:30.959> stuff<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:32.400> I'm<00:03:32.609> already<00:03:32.819> getting

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
amazing stuff if I'm already getting

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.089 
amazing stuff if I'm already getting
this<00:03:33.209> kind<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.480> growth<00:03:33.690> it's<00:03:34.650> gonna<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:34.889> crazy

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
this kind of growth it's gonna be crazy

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.800 
this kind of growth it's gonna be crazy
to<00:03:35.340> see<00:03:35.489> what<00:03:35.609> I<00:03:35.639> get<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> future<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.449> mean

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
to see what I get in the future I mean

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.280 
to see what I get in the future I mean
it's<00:03:37.019> just<00:03:37.079> really<00:03:37.980> good<00:03:38.190> stuff<00:03:38.459> guys<00:03:38.669> I<00:03:39.290> I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
it's just really good stuff guys I I

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.930 
it's just really good stuff guys I I
don't<00:03:40.709> really<00:03:40.980> know<00:03:41.129> how<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> works<00:03:41.609> out<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:41.910> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
don't really know how it works out in a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.819 
don't really know how it works out in a
big<00:03:42.120> tank<00:03:42.329> though<00:03:42.480> i'd<00:03:42.629> imagine<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:43.260> pretty

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
big tank though i'd imagine be pretty

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.379 
big tank though i'd imagine be pretty
much<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.099> same<00:03:44.250> thing

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
much the same thing

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.930 
much the same thing
but<00:03:45.750> all<00:03:46.440> i<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.829> say<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.489> nano

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
but all i can say is if you have a nano

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.909 
but all i can say is if you have a nano
and<00:03:48.599> you're<00:03:48.930> looking<00:03:49.199> for<00:03:49.440> some<00:03:49.590> good<00:03:49.769> results

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
and you're looking for some good results

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.629 
and you're looking for some good results
i<00:03:50.699> i<00:03:51.209> do<00:03:51.510> recommend<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.370> don't<00:03:53.370> wash<00:03:53.609> it

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
i i do recommend this don't wash it

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.909 
i i do recommend this don't wash it
though<00:03:54.030> that's<00:03:54.299> one<00:03:54.480> thing<00:03:54.660> i<00:03:54.750> did<00:03:54.930> read<00:03:55.169> don't

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
though that's one thing i did read don't

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.149 
though that's one thing i did read don't
wash<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.159> prior<00:03:56.699> to<00:03:57.060> filling<00:03:57.659> up<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.169> didn't

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
wash it prior to filling up I didn't

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.339 
wash it prior to filling up I didn't
wash<00:03:59.280> mine<00:03:59.549> at<00:03:59.669> all<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.449> day<00:04:00.629> after<00:04:01.019> it's

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
wash mine at all the day after it's

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.390 
wash mine at all the day after it's
crystal<00:04:02.480> crystal<00:04:03.480> clear<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.049> mean<00:04:04.349> there's<00:04:05.099> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
crystal crystal clear I mean there's the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.920 
crystal crystal clear I mean there's the
new<00:04:05.760> life<00:04:05.909> spectrum<00:04:06.030> at<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.629> other<00:04:06.750> end

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
new life spectrum at the other end

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.089 
new life spectrum at the other end
contain<00:04:07.319> crystal<00:04:07.889> clear<00:04:08.099> stuff<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.319> just

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
contain crystal clear stuff so I just

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.830 
contain crystal clear stuff so I just
put<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.790> ziplock<00:04:13.159> ziploc<00:04:14.159> bag<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:14.699> here<00:04:15.060> on

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
put a ziplock ziploc bag right here on

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.879 
put a ziplock ziploc bag right here on
the<00:04:15.989> bottom<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:17.359> did<00:04:18.359> perfectly<00:04:19.049> well<00:04:19.260> so

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
the bottom and did perfectly well so
