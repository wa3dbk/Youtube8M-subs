either by SKU by barcode or by the name
which<00:00:40.320> makes<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.710> simple<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> find

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
which makes it really simple to find

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
which makes it really simple to find
something<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.809> course<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> always

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
something and of course I can always

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
something and of course I can always
enter<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.460> barcode<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:45.149> zapping<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.840> my

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
enter a barcode by zapping it with my

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
enter a barcode by zapping it with my
barcode<00:00:46.379> scanner<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.430> bunch<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.969> ways

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
barcode scanner so it's a bunch of ways

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.580 
barcode scanner so it's a bunch of ways
you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.600> add<00:00:48.870> products<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
you can actually add products to the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
you can actually add products to the
order<00:00:49.890> once<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> products<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> the
