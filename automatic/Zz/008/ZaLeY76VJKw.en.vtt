 chorizos this health directly all 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.200
 the pod but now all the meat that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.520
 after that he will disgrace 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 perfectly exactly cove and you

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.990
 age that dale dale 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:06.250
 now everything that went 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.590
 surely if this pancito visited that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.209
 country and it's actually pizza dough that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.890
 it is also a mass of pompanos appeared 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.080

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.180
 continued giving slowly in the refrigerator 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.190
 I took it out two hours ago from the refrigerator 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.920
 because the mass of zero does not need everything 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.830
 this the black plastic a bit of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.960
 chimichurri with the principles of running 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.000
 and it is well drained and if not it comes 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.400
 dresses like to prepare directly 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.410

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.090
 60 grams 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.120
 d 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 a little bit of flour on top very badly 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.659
 a little area above or below 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.549
 I always tell you that people stay 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:15.780
 Round up up down 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.459
 finite how do you have to throw it in such 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.739
 so that between the chorizo ​​just 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.319
 long and win without theoretical already cooked 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 and already decided director habiten goal 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.400
 habitual and pegadito to here chiquitito of 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.349
 my heart crushed a little bit the 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.599
 I'm sure I'll need to take out a 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.980
 little outside this and we're going to 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.080

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:07.449
 center 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:09.879
