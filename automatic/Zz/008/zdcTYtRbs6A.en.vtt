look right here this line going up
that's<00:00:21.169> my<00:00:21.320> last<00:00:21.590> positive<00:00:22.220> terminal<00:00:22.610> this<00:00:23.329> is

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
that's my last positive terminal this is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.229 
that's my last positive terminal this is
actually<00:00:23.810> going<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.200> battery<00:00:24.500> charger

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
actually going to the battery charger

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.740 
actually going to the battery charger
for<00:00:26.239> the<00:00:26.270> 72<00:00:26.960> volt<00:00:27.169> charger<00:00:27.500> for<00:00:27.649> my<00:00:27.739> motor

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
for the 72 volt charger for my motor

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.030 
for the 72 volt charger for my motor
that<00:00:29.750> was<00:00:29.930> new<00:00:30.140> I<00:00:30.349> used<00:00:30.559> to<00:00:30.619> have<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.829> clamp

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
that was new I used to have to clamp

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.889 
that was new I used to have to clamp
them<00:00:31.250> on<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:32.090> I<00:00:32.180> well<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:32.329> can<00:00:32.480> see<00:00:32.630> if<00:00:32.719> this

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
them on and I well you can see if this

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.090 
them on and I well you can see if this
battery<00:00:33.200> terminal<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.620> pretty<00:00:33.800> chewed<00:00:33.980> up

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
battery terminal is pretty chewed up

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.700 
battery terminal is pretty chewed up
because<00:00:34.430> of<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.390> now<00:00:35.510> it's<00:00:35.690> hardwired<00:00:36.440> in

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
because of it but now it's hardwired in

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.230 
because of it but now it's hardwired in
there<00:00:38.140> if<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:39.260> look<00:00:39.380> up<00:00:39.530> here<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.520> same<00:00:40.850> white

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
there if we look up here the same white

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.160 
there if we look up here the same white
wire<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:42.620> we've<00:00:42.740> got<00:00:42.950> coming<00:00:43.400> up<00:00:43.580> here<00:00:44.170> that

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
wire that we've got coming up here that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.870 
wire that we've got coming up here that
actually<00:00:45.320> goes<00:00:45.590> down<00:00:45.830> to<00:00:46.070> my<00:00:46.190> 12<00:00:46.520> volt<00:00:46.790> charger

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
actually goes down to my 12 volt charger

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.740 
actually goes down to my 12 volt charger
and<00:00:48.460> connects<00:00:49.460> into<00:00:49.610> my<00:00:49.790> accessory<00:00:50.329> battery

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
and connects into my accessory battery

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.190 
and connects into my accessory battery
they're<00:00:52.120> here<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.750> course<00:00:53.990> you've<00:00:54.110> been

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
they're here of course you've been

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.410 
they're here of course you've been
watching<00:00:54.410> along<00:00:54.739> you'll<00:00:54.950> notice<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.970> red<00:00:56.180> is

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
watching along you'll notice the red is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.140 
watching along you'll notice the red is
something<00:00:56.750> new<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.370> my<00:00:58.489> heating<00:00:58.820> system

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
something new this is my heating system

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.210 
something new this is my heating system
which<00:00:59.600> I'm<00:00:59.720> still<00:00:59.960> working<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.590> kind<00:01:01.130> of

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
which I'm still working to kind of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.830 
which I'm still working to kind of
perfect<00:01:01.579> here<00:01:02.470> but<00:01:03.879> up<00:01:04.879> here<00:01:04.939> we've<00:01:05.540> got<00:01:05.570> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
perfect here but up here we've got the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.130 
perfect here but up here we've got the
pump<00:01:06.220> then<00:01:07.220> here<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.240> heater<00:01:08.810> now<00:01:09.080> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
pump then here is the heater now the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.530 
pump then here is the heater now the
heater<00:01:09.380> runs<00:01:09.680> off<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.130> seat<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.300> we'll<00:01:11.390> actually

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
heater runs off a seat so we'll actually

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.060 
heater runs off a seat so we'll actually
only<00:01:11.810> heat<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.170> fluid<00:01:12.500> while<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.650> car<00:01:12.950> is

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
only heat the fluid while a car is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.860 
only heat the fluid while a car is
plugged<00:01:13.400> in<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:15.380> pump<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.970> 12<00:01:17.420> volt<00:01:17.659> DC

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
plugged in the pump this is 12 volt DC

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.390 
plugged in the pump this is 12 volt DC
so<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.530> will<00:01:18.680> run<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.130> be<00:01:19.190> able<00:01:19.250> to

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
so this will run and be able to

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.670 
so this will run and be able to
circulate<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.940> fluid<00:01:20.299> even<00:01:21.080> after<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.440> cars

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
circulate the fluid even after the cars

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.300 
circulate the fluid even after the cars
running<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:22.370> not<00:01:22.520> plugged<00:01:22.760> in<00:01:24.130> now<00:01:25.130> of

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
running and it's not plugged in now of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.910 
running and it's not plugged in now of
course<00:01:25.520> heater<00:01:25.940> heats<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:26.450> fluid<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:27.620> pump

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
course heater heats the fluid the pump

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.280 
course heater heats the fluid the pump
here<00:01:28.250> pumps<00:01:28.580> fluid<00:01:28.850> into<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.120> I<00:01:29.450> wasn't<00:01:30.200> even

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
here pumps fluid into the I wasn't even

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.120 
here pumps fluid into the I wasn't even
looking<00:01:30.350> there<00:01:30.590> wasn't<00:01:30.890> now<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.799> pump<00:01:33.799> will

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
looking there wasn't now the pump will

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.730 
looking there wasn't now the pump will
pump<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.490> fluid<00:01:34.640> down<00:01:34.970> into<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.270> heater<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
pump the fluid down into the heater the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.580 
pump the fluid down into the heater the
heater<00:01:37.040> comes<00:01:37.430> out<00:01:37.780> goes<00:01:38.780> into<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.080> firewall

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
heater comes out goes into the firewall

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.340 
heater comes out goes into the firewall
to<00:01:39.770> go<00:01:39.890> into<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.070> heater<00:01:40.280> core<00:01:40.930> cooler<00:01:41.930> fluid

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
to go into the heater core cooler fluid

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.980 
to go into the heater core cooler fluid
comes<00:01:42.590> out<00:01:42.830> comes<00:01:43.760> back<00:01:44.000> up<00:01:44.270> goes<00:01:44.540> into<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
comes out comes back up goes into the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.420 
comes out comes back up goes into the
pump<00:01:46.420> goes<00:01:47.420> into<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.720> heater<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.920> on<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.400> forth

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
pump goes into the heater so on so forth

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.359 
pump goes into the heater so on so forth
I<00:01:50.680> think<00:01:51.680> that's<00:01:51.830> about<00:01:51.920> all<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.189> new<00:01:52.310> stuff

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
I think that's about all the new stuff

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.580 
I think that's about all the new stuff
up<00:01:52.700> here<00:01:52.970> actually<00:01:53.840> now<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.140> I'm<00:01:54.320> looking

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
up here actually now that I'm looking

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.690 
up here actually now that I'm looking
you<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.850> see<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.240> tube<00:01:56.600> right<00:01:56.930> here<00:01:57.700> that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
you can see this tube right here that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.820 
you can see this tube right here that
tube<00:01:59.710> comes<00:02:00.710> down<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.700> right<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.830> now

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
tube comes down to right there now

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.620 
tube comes down to right there now
that's<00:02:03.979> kind<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.220> my<00:02:04.340> air<00:02:04.520> intake<00:02:05.090> for<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's kind of my air intake for the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.100 
that's kind of my air intake for the
engine<00:02:05.810> compartment<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.560> noticed<00:02:07.460> after<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.820> few

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
engine compartment I noticed after a few

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.949 
engine compartment I noticed after a few
10<00:02:09.110> mile<00:02:09.349> rides<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.700> motor<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.209> control<00:02:11.779> our

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
10 mile rides the motor and control our

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.739 
10 mile rides the motor and control our
God<00:02:12.109> actually<00:02:12.499> pretty<00:02:12.709> warm<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:14.450> all<00:02:14.599> this

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
God actually pretty warm with all this

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.750 
God actually pretty warm with all this
vinyl<00:02:15.079> that<00:02:15.829> I<00:02:15.859> have

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
vinyl that I have

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.789 
vinyl that I have
up<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:16.939> the<00:02:16.970> front<00:02:17.239> is<00:02:17.810> actually<00:02:18.260> blocking<00:02:18.470> any

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
up in the front is actually blocking any

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.089 
up in the front is actually blocking any
air<00:02:19.040> flow<00:02:19.430> into<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.239> engine<00:02:20.569> compartment<00:02:21.099> so

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
air flow into the engine compartment so

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.220 
air flow into the engine compartment so
I<00:02:22.129> put<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.519> little<00:02:22.640> tube<00:02:22.939> in<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.329> put<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.140> at

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
I put that little tube in I put in at

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.619 
I put that little tube in I put in at
that<00:02:24.379> angle<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> figured<00:02:25.310> rain<00:02:25.629> wouldn't

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
that angle so I figured rain wouldn't

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.110 
that angle so I figured rain wouldn't
wouldn't<00:02:27.500> get<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.799> quite<00:02:28.099> as<00:02:28.250> easy<00:02:28.549> where<00:02:29.000> it

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
wouldn't get in quite as easy where it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.940 
wouldn't get in quite as easy where it
curves<00:02:30.049> up<00:02:30.439> from<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.250> bumper<00:02:31.760> there<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.769> can

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
curves up from the bumper there so I can

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.190 
curves up from the bumper there so I can
still<00:02:34.190> get<00:02:34.310> some<00:02:34.430> air<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.000> haven't<00:02:35.780> tested<00:02:35.989> a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
still get some air in I haven't tested a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
still get some air in I haven't tested a
lot<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.590> any<00:02:36.739> big<00:02:36.980> rides<00:02:37.510> anything<00:02:38.510> with<00:02:38.629> some

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
lot on any big rides anything with some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.530 
lot on any big rides anything with some
mileage<00:02:38.989> so<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.379> don't<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:40.030> don't<00:02:41.030> know<00:02:41.239> how<00:02:41.390> much

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
mileage so I don't I don't know how much

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.059 
mileage so I don't I don't know how much
of<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.720> difference<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.110> making<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.590> since<00:02:42.799> then

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
of a difference is making but since then

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.039 
of a difference is making but since then
you<00:02:43.730> know<00:02:43.760> they<00:02:43.970> haven't<00:02:44.150> warmed<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:44.870> all

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
you know they haven't warmed up at all

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.440 
you know they haven't warmed up at all
so<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.590> think<00:02:45.859> that's<00:02:46.220> good<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.940> if<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.239> come

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
so I think that's good and if we come

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.080 
so I think that's good and if we come
around<00:02:50.569> at<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.959> trunk<00:02:51.790> here's<00:02:52.790> some<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
around at the trunk here's some of the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.619 
around at the trunk here's some of the
good<00:02:53.299> stuff<00:02:53.329> here<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.280> my<00:02:55.430> 110<00:02:56.030> junction

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
good stuff here this is my 110 junction

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.629 
good stuff here this is my 110 junction
box<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:59.720> 110<00:03:00.139> line<00:03:00.379> comes<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:00.980> goes<00:03:01.400> into

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
box so the 110 line comes in goes into

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.110 
box so the 110 line comes in goes into
the<00:03:01.730> junction<00:03:02.150> box<00:03:02.590> splits<00:03:03.590> off<00:03:03.799> in<00:03:04.010> there<00:03:04.280> to

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the junction box splits off in there to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.559 
the junction box splits off in there to
my<00:03:05.599> 12-volt<00:03:06.109> accessory<00:03:06.260> charger<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:08.420> also

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
my 12-volt accessory charger it also

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.539 
my 12-volt accessory charger it also
goes<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:08.930> my<00:03:09.260> 72<00:03:09.920> volt<00:03:10.159> charger<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:12.430> one<00:03:13.430> of

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
goes to my 72 volt charger and one of

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.399 
goes to my 72 volt charger and one of
these<00:03:13.639> wires<00:03:13.909> here<00:03:14.269> also<00:03:14.480> runs<00:03:14.900> up<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.109> the

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
these wires here also runs up to the

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.440 
these wires here also runs up to the
heater<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.400> engine<00:03:16.700> Department<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:20.299> is

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
heater in the engine Department this is

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.330 
heater in the engine Department this is
actually<00:03:20.780> mounted<00:03:21.139> now<00:03:21.349> which<00:03:21.889> is<00:03:22.040> very<00:03:22.280> good

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
actually mounted now which is very good

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.240 
actually mounted now which is very good
and<00:03:23.329> they're<00:03:23.510> pretty<00:03:23.720> tight<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:25.099> on

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and they're pretty tight and it's on

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.839 
and they're pretty tight and it's on
this<00:03:25.400> rubber<00:03:25.669> mat<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:27.739> don't<00:03:28.549> know<00:03:28.609> how<00:03:28.699> well

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
this rubber mat I don't know how well

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.759 
this rubber mat I don't know how well
you<00:03:28.879> can<00:03:28.970> see<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.359> back<00:03:29.510> there<00:03:29.569> but<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.470> line

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
you can see it back there but this line

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.490 
you can see it back there but this line
right<00:03:31.069> here<00:03:31.329> this<00:03:32.329> is<00:03:32.449> my<00:03:32.599> last<00:03:32.840> positive

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
right here this is my last positive

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.229 
right here this is my last positive
terminal<00:03:33.889> in<00:03:33.949> the<00:03:34.010> pack<00:03:34.220> or<00:03:34.849> should<00:03:35.090> be<00:03:35.180> the

terminal in the pack or should be the
last<00:03:35.329> negative<00:03:35.810> terminal<00:03:36.199> in<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.319> pack<00:03:36.530> so

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
last negative terminal in the pack so

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.770 
last negative terminal in the pack so
this<00:03:37.519> is<00:03:37.549> hardwired<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.419> now<00:03:38.599> too<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:40.780> right

putting<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.450> socket<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.039> gas<00:04:28.340> cap<00:04:28.539> because

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
putting a socket in the gas cap because

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.550 
putting a socket in the gas cap because
the<00:04:29.630> socket<00:04:30.020> means<00:04:30.200> you'd<00:04:30.289> have<00:04:30.320> to

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
the socket means you'd have to

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.020 
the socket means you'd have to
a<00:04:30.590> separate<00:04:31.010> extension<00:04:31.460> cord<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:31.940> have

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
to plug one end in there one end in

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.960 
to plug one end in there one end in
there<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.800> constantly<00:04:37.220> have<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.460> rattle<00:04:37.880> it

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
there you constantly have to rattle it

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.950 
there you constantly have to rattle it
up<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.210> throw<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.389> in<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.570> trunk<00:04:38.780> or
