consider that much resolution in the
first<00:00:39.660> place<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.740> like<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.190> transition

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

from standard up to high def a lot of

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.990 
from standard up to high def a lot of
projects<00:00:44.100> could<00:00:44.310> have<00:00:44.430> been<00:00:44.550> done<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.880> high

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
projects could have been done in high

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.820 
projects could have been done in high
def<00:00:45.240> but<00:00:45.480> they<00:00:45.570> weren't<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.470> later<00:00:46.740> that

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
def but they weren't and then later that

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.470 
def but they weren't and then later that
people<00:00:47.370> were<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.580> ah<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.300> should

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
people were like ah we really should

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
people were like ah we really should
have<00:00:48.570> done<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.810> in<00:00:48.930> HD<00:00:49.080> when<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.220> had<00:00:50.400> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
have done it in HD when we had the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
have done it in HD when we had the
chance<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.150> could<00:00:51.330> have<00:00:51.420> finished<00:00:51.540> in<00:00:51.810> SD<00:00:52.170> for

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
chance and could have finished in SD for

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
chance and could have finished in SD for
then<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:52.980> HD<00:00:53.280> later<00:00:53.490> also<00:00:54.240> we<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.510> shoot

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
then and then HD later also we can shoot

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
then and then HD later also we can shoot
HD<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.560> 4k<00:00:55.920> cameras<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> get

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
HD with these 4k cameras and you get

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
HD with these 4k cameras and you get
really<00:00:56.700> stunning<00:00:57.030> HD<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:57.900> using

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
really stunning HD because you're using

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.050 
really stunning HD because you're using
port<00:00:58.320> case<00:00:58.470> sensors<00:00:58.860> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.580> get<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> kind<00:00:59.970> of

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
port case sensors so you get it kind of

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.420 
port case sensors so you get it kind of
the<00:01:00.240> best<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.510> both<00:01:00.570> worlds<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.220> lot<00:01:02.220> of<00:01:02.250> our

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the best of both worlds a lot of our

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
the best of both worlds a lot of our
equipment<00:01:02.610> we're<00:01:03.000> using<00:01:03.180> 12<00:01:03.570> gig<00:01:03.780> SD<00:01:03.960> i--<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
equipment we're using 12 gig SD i-- and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.840 
equipment we're using 12 gig SD i-- and
the<00:01:04.530> reason<00:01:04.650> why<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.100> doing<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.579> is<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the reason why we're doing that is that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
the reason why we're doing that is that
way<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.180> Ultra<00:01:06.570> HD<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.990> 4k<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.009> up<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
way in Ultra HD and 4k you can do up to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.730 
way in Ultra HD and 4k you can do up to
60<00:01:08.550> frames<00:01:08.760> per<00:01:08.880> second<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
60 frames per second so here you are

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
60 frames per second so here you are
buying<00:01:11.040> product<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:11.760> basically<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> same

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
buying product at basically the same

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.440 
buying product at basically the same
price<00:01:12.870> as<00:01:13.080> HD<00:01:13.470> product<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.190> will<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.880> future

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
price as HD product that will do future

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.560 
price as HD product that will do future

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
for k-12 gig SD I can really carry a lot

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.360 
for k-12 gig SD I can really carry a lot
of<00:01:18.600> data<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> that's<00:01:19.800> why<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.070> chose<00:01:20.100> that

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
of data and that's why we chose that

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.570 
of data and that's why we chose that
format<00:01:20.700> both<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.810> 300<00:01:22.409> mark<00:01:22.440> 2<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.340> new

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
format both the 300 mark 2 and this new

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.690 
format both the 300 mark 2 and this new

XC 10 are using C fast is their current
recording<00:01:27.180> mediums<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> allows<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
recording mediums so that allows them to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
recording mediums so that allows them to
capture<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> high<00:01:29.310> bitrate<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> very

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
capture the high bitrate so this is very

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
capture the high bitrate so this is very
sophisticated<00:01:31.700> technology<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.880> terms<00:01:33.150> of

internal recording shooting in 4k right

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
internal recording shooting in 4k right
now<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.510> a<00:01:36.540> forward-looking<00:01:37.049> decision<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
now is a forward-looking decision and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740 
now is a forward-looking decision and
the<00:01:38.010> good<00:01:38.220> news<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.090> most<00:01:39.299> camera

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the good news is that most camera

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.660 
the good news is that most camera
companies<00:01:40.140> offer<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.590> choices<00:01:40.620> for<00:01:41.340> shooting

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
companies offer you choices for shooting

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.820 
companies offer you choices for shooting
at<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:41.909> resolution<00:01:42.290> what's<00:01:43.290> changed<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
at that resolution what's changed this
