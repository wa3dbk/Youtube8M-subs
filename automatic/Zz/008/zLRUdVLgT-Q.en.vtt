all<00:00:03.950> right<00:00:04.100> so<00:00:04.250> we're<00:00:04.430> taking<00:00:05.230> this<00:00:06.230> pulley

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
all right so we're taking this pulley

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.010 
all right so we're taking this pulley
off<00:00:07.009> and<00:00:07.940> it<00:00:08.059> requires<00:00:08.450> a<00:00:10.480> SCR<00:00:11.480> v10<00:00:12.379> it's<00:00:12.770> a

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
off and it requires a SCR v10 it's a

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:31.660 
off and it requires a SCR v10 it's a
stupid<00:00:15.020> they<00:00:15.289> put<00:00:15.500> a<00:00:15.530> Allan<00:00:30.160> alright<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:31.400> here

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
stupid they put a Allan alright so here

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.099 
stupid they put a Allan alright so here
I<00:00:31.700> am

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.889 

this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> hardest<00:00:35.519> part<00:00:35.719> trying<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> get

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
this is the hardest part trying to get

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.459 
this is the hardest part trying to get
this<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:38.010> tensioner<00:00:38.519> out<00:00:38.989> this<00:00:39.989> bolt<00:00:40.230> was

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this on this tensioner out this bolt was

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
this on this tensioner out this bolt was
easy<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.890> used<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:43.549> 12<00:00:44.549> millimeter<00:00:44.909> wrench<00:00:45.750> right

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
easy I used a 12 millimeter wrench right

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.289 
easy I used a 12 millimeter wrench right
there<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.949> for<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.399> other<00:00:47.549> Bowl<00:00:47.820> you're

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
there and for the other Bowl you're

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:49.819 
there and for the other Bowl you're
gonna<00:00:48.390> ain't<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.229> to<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> set<00:00:49.739> up

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
gonna ain't gonna have to use a set up

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.240 
gonna ain't gonna have to use a set up
exactly<00:00:50.549> like<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.409> 12

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
exactly like this so we have a 12

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.929 
exactly like this so we have a 12
millimeter<00:00:54.109> socket<00:00:55.109> with<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.589> elbow<00:00:55.979> and

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:56.939 
millimeter socket with the elbow and

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.569 
millimeter socket with the elbow and
extensions<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.619> have<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.159> electives

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
extensions you have to use the electives

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.349 
extensions you have to use the electives
because<00:00:59.939> the<00:01:00.689> way<00:01:00.869> they<00:01:01.350> designed<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
because the way they designed it you you

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
because the way they designed it you you
had<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> squeeze<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.350> yet<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:04.949> underneath<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
had to squeeze it yet go underneath the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
had to squeeze it yet go underneath the
car<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.020> there's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.319> gap<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:07.649> there

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
car and there's a little gap right there

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
car and there's a little gap right there
and<00:01:08.399> that's<00:01:09.179> where<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> squeeze

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and that's where you're going to squeeze

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
and that's where you're going to squeeze
your<00:01:10.409> extension<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.039> the<00:01:11.100> elbow<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:11.610> you're

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
your extension with the elbow and you're

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.359 
your extension with the elbow and you're
going<00:01:11.819> to<00:01:11.880> come<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.360> Neath<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> bolt

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
going to come right or Neath the bolt

let's<00:06:17.229> mean<00:06:17.380> just<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:17.800> alternator

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.680 

I<00:06:20.770> could<00:06:21.640> just<00:06:21.970> power<00:06:22.660> steering<00:06:23.250> pump<00:06:24.690> let's

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
I could just power steering pump let's

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.070 
I could just power steering pump let's
adjust<00:06:26.170> this<00:06:26.410> belt<00:06:27.420> I<00:06:28.420> know<00:06:28.600> you<00:06:28.810> have<00:06:28.930> them

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080

is this one you get unscrew that one and
on<00:06:48.430> the<00:06:48.550> side<00:06:48.820> right<00:06:49.060> here<00:06:49.530> kind<00:06:50.530> of<00:06:50.560> like<00:06:50.680> on

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
on the side right here kind of like on

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.500 
on the side right here kind of like on
the<00:06:50.920> alternator<00:06:51.430> they're<00:06:51.970> the<00:06:52.090> same<00:06:52.240> thing

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
the alternator they're the same thing

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.140 
the alternator they're the same thing
that<00:06:52.690> you<00:06:52.990> in<00:06:53.140> spew<00:06:53.440> it<00:06:53.560> goes<00:06:53.710> this<00:06:54.130> way<00:06:54.370> and<00:06:54.640> if

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
that you in spew it goes this way and if

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
you kind it goes this way so kind of

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.280 
you kind it goes this way so kind of
hard<00:07:00.040> explain<00:07:00.400> it's<00:07:00.790> not<00:07:00.970> even<00:07:01.360> when<00:07:02.110> I<00:07:02.140> got
