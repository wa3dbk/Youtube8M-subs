so first off let's take a look at the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.099 
so first off let's take a look at the
changes<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> his<00:00:17.699> overall<00:00:18.029> kit<00:00:18.420> after<00:00:18.600> the

changes and his overall kit after the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.769 
changes and his overall kit after the
rework<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:20.160> his<00:00:20.430> passive<00:00:20.970> energized<00:00:21.570> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
rework now his passive energized is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.960 
rework now his passive energized is
still<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> same<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.250> key<00:00:23.400> component<00:00:23.910> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
still the same and a key component of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.630 
still the same and a key component of
skarner's<00:00:24.420> kit<00:00:24.720> every<00:00:25.590> auto<00:00:25.830> attack<00:00:26.160> reduces

skarner's kit every auto attack reduces

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.609 
skarner's kit every auto attack reduces
your<00:00:26.760> ability<00:00:26.820> cooldowns<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.840> alongside

your ability cooldowns and alongside

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
your ability cooldowns and alongside
some<00:00:29.099> cooldown<00:00:29.460> reduction<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.119> allows<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
some cooldown reduction this allows you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
some cooldown reduction this allows you
to<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.779> your<00:00:30.990> old<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.380> faster<00:00:31.859> than<00:00:32.399> expected

to have your old up faster than expected

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.850 
to have your old up faster than expected
so<00:00:33.300> remember<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> correctly<00:00:34.380> when

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so remember to use it correctly when

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.000 
so remember to use it correctly when

definitely<00:02:29.280> take<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> bit<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.060> practice<00:02:30.480> but

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
definitely take a bit of practice but

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.809 
definitely take a bit of practice but
remember<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.349> W<00:02:31.769> takes<00:02:31.980> three<00:02:32.340> seconds<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
remember your W takes three seconds to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.940 
remember your W takes three seconds to
ramp<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.780> goes<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.290> another<00:02:34.440> three

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950

seconds<00:02:35.370> at<00:02:35.430> max<00:02:35.580> speed<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.690> means<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
seconds at max speed this means that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.259 
seconds at max speed this means that
sometimes<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.950> might<00:02:38.310> want<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> activate<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
sometimes you might want to activate it

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.870 
sometimes you might want to activate it

a bit early for ganking and the range

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.000 
a bit early for ganking and the range
slow<00:02:42.150> also<00:02:42.569> makes<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> easier<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.530> close<00:02:43.739> the

and<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:56.459> brings<00:02:56.700> me<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.000> my<00:02:57.120> second<00:02:57.510> point

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
and this brings me to my second point

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.900 
and this brings me to my second point
which<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:57.930> lacks<00:02:58.440> flexibility<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.549> terms<00:02:59.580> of

which is lacks flexibility in terms of

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.180 
which is lacks flexibility in terms of
builds<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> direct<00:03:01.650> consequence

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
builds now this is a direct consequence

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.670 
builds now this is a direct consequence
of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.459> lack<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.760> sticking<00:03:03.360> power<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:04.410> need

of the lack of sticking power you need

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.949 
of the lack of sticking power you need
something<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.430> make<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.750> my

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
something to make up for it now in my

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.660 
something to make up for it now in my

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
some stickiness so now that we've

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
some stickiness so now that we've

let's<00:03:22.200> turn<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.530> things<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.310> could<00:03:23.519> make<00:03:23.760> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
let's turn to things that could make you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.900 
let's turn to things that could make you
a<00:03:23.970> better<00:03:24.420> skarner<00:03:25.040> starting<00:03:26.040> off<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.549> runes

a better skarner starting off with runes
there<00:03:27.239> are<00:03:27.359> two<00:03:27.600> setups<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.230> run<00:03:28.440> one

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
there are two setups you can run one

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.440 
there are two setups you can run one
being<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> typical<00:03:29.519> setup<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:30.239> most
