00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.730
 Hello dear friends with you roofs and 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.130
 Today I am starting a new rubric which 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.680
 called the strangest easter eggs in 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.390
 gta san andreas if you like it 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.430
 this rubric you can support it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.949
 Like positive comments and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.080
 then it is possible and will continue so 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.900
 rushed the first release I want you 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.760
 show easter eggs in the city of san fierro 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.390
 how much do you think that this city is the most 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.489
 big on Easter eggs like small 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.430
 such a big but today I will show you 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.920
 the biggest easter eggs and so our first 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.800
 the package is still creepy 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.320
 this sambo company you exist 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.469
 city ​​of san fierro and she is to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.379
 link exon the existence of a zombie give 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.230
 me the existence of a zombie in a game or 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.379
 in general of existence and to this simply 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.690
 appearing like a zombie self-suction in a zombie 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.140
 in the game it seems to me no one believes 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.140
 because it is the most probably stupid myth 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.110
 which was coined at all in the game gta 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 san andreas sending to him anyway 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.550
 there is this company ok let's 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.429
 move on to the next easter eggs and so 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.590
 The second premise is probably the strangest 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.590
 because i can't reach normal 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.959
 explanations in the dark on one 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.690
 from the ports in the city of San Fierro appears 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.880
 in a strange submarine which 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.550
 just doesn't make sense but here 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.800
 only appears in the dark 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.440
 in the afternoon she never appears here but 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.830
 she do nothing here is just worth 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.450
 and 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.780
 and all we sit down is not the same can not but she 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.679
 looks pretty cool and if too 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.239
 quite such a nice easter egg 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.250
 hinting at something on and still so far 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:03.530
 did not understand what if you know what 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.810
 hints this easter egg write to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 comments well, we go to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.060
 the next package 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.510
 I schA I Easter eggs is probably the most 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.610
 authentic is a reference to the present 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.070
 an accident that was yes 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.900
 which took place the action in the game in those 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.100
 times when action came in the game 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.720
 this is the 90s of the city ​​of san francisco 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.870
 who served as the prototype of the city 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 San Fierro earthquake happened 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.140
 because in the city of San Fierro 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.090
 attend unfinished bridges and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.750
 abandoned construction sites 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.210
 closed roads all this is to 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.210
 a reference to a large earthquake which 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.670
 it was probably the nineties 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.350
 is the biggest easter egg in all 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.520
 GTS Andreas 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.920

 located on the bridge of Kirov bada and what 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.070
 This Easter egg represents itself. 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.130
 the bridge says there are no easter eggs 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.820
 get out of here like this 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.830
 scare chases us away from here it's like 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.300
 Would Easter eggs tell that

 there are no easter eggs 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.180

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.250
