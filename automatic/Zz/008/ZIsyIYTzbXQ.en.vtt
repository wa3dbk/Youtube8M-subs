00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.950
 the cities of gold like you 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.500
 what we did with bernard on 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.720
 was passionate being a kid we were 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.300
 very passionate about cinema theater and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.150
 cinema painting in every way that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.740
 goes back very far so our dream 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.380
 it's always been to make a movie a 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 feature film and today we're going 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.130
 welcome in a few minutes you can 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 I do not know if they are there we will react 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
 so the producer raphael benoliel the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.630
 so if they call me can 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.630
 join us 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.650
 so rafael and happened an agreement 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.370
 with us now so he goes 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.140
 develop 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.670
 we worked becomes a certain time 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.110
 it is not today but we are 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.840
 decided not to announce it as long as it was 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.330
 not sure therefore to develop a long 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.040
 footage in real view of the cities of gold and 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.570
 in fact when I say a feature film I 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.310
 am a bit restrictive here because his 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.619
 project is to a series of feature films 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 this is raphael hello excuse me 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.320
 I lost my voice but yes 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590
 I'm pretty happy with the announced 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.130
 officially here to nice because I 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.510
 am Nice 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.000
 so I believe a number 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:38.630
 of elements and that's fine and so here 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.790
 it's true that a few months ago a year ago 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.509
 and a half now two years maybe we 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.850
 to jean will entrust the rights 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.740
 of adaptation and I am very happy and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.050
 so we work hard above 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.930
 I met other people 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.880
 over time whose virgile to the money is 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.690
 with me and who as such camera times 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.500
 that they stop filming a moment 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.850
 anyway and who is a fan like you 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.979
 mysterious cities of gold and who will 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.149
 follow a little by my side 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.429
 evolution is shared all this on 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.510
 internet so that you can 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.459
 participate in the adventure also but 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.550
 I may be doing hello all 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.550
 the world 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.019
 am I am very happy to be there with 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.489
 all of you today if one day I have 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.989
 told me that I will share the same 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.610
 scene that bernard deyriÃ¨s and jean 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.380
 chalopin I would not have thought 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.570
 even though I hope it is very very strong 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.680
 well, we must always believe in 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.560
 his dreams because the dream becomes 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.450
 reality today I have a chance 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.190
 exceptional is to have met 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.650
 to burst through a small work 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.170
 I realized who will be projected 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.440
 in a moment 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.450
 a small gift to advertise on 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.329
 internet precisely the the setting in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.700
 filmyard to also announce the 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.299
 launch of the site on which you

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.959
 project 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.670

 it's too late in fact the site will have a 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.090
 participatory dimension because you

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.629
 of the movie 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.159
 I will have to let Raphael talk about this 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.090
 aspect there it is serious challenge that costs 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:42.010
 very very expensive to produce and and if the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.629
 fans can participate it's a series 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:51.489 --> 00:04:03.849
 the site address that is going to be 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:05.620
 projected with teaser thank you raphael 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.639
 except the fact you are Nice and I 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.739
 see that the reactions are rather 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.819
 favorable 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.799
 it would be good because we know well 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.659
 jean and bernard but maybe you 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.979
 present a little bit and know 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.359
 it's a little bit your curriculum 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.709
 cinematographic before their 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.759
 training in quotation marks 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.050
 subject wounds then I do I have 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.470
 done a lot and still today 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.780
 executive production costs for 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.000
 foreign productions in France and 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.620
 that's how that's why I 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 works a lot internationally 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.380
 and it's true that even though 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.810
 mysterious cities of gold it's a project 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.759
 already in the room initially but it's 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.520
 not a film that can be more 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.960
 not a French film by the means 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.669
 who are going to have to is ready and so it was 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.680
 for that it is also a subject that has me 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.780
 interested beyond when I was 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.219
 child obviously and dreams and 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.020
 I had the chance to speak a 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.729
 little bit of what I did so from 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.320
 participate in foreign productions 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.690
 who have turned to France or even to 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.310
 abroad especially many with 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.630
 starting working title of a company 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.099
 english i worked on love 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.229
 actually or jones the movie that has a little 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.449
 little changed my life that i co produced the 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.870
 woody allen movie 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.819
 midnight in Paris is with the Oscars 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.550
 and others inevitably it changes a little 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.099
 little my career and since I participated 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.949
 to the Smurfs 2 who will be coming out this summer 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.699
 rhett de and many other productions 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.919
 international 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.279
 for the movie cities of gold 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.749
 he was arrested that it's necessarily a 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.309
 live movie is what it was all about 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.719
 following the departure decision because he 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.520
 have been so many rumors for a few 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.779
 years because during animations to be 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.110
 product then we have lost a bit 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:42.089
 finally it was my basic urge 1 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.099
 but it's true that a year ago we 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:48.210
 launched a little poll on facebook that 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.379
 is for fans and that's why 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.620
 it's important with the presence of 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:55.050
 virgile and you participate all the 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.229
 time to that and the result these are 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.039
 I was more than 60% I think of 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.319
 all the people who have kindly 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.479
 answer wanted more than 90% 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.189
 a film adaptation and 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.460
 more than 60% live adaptation 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.189
 so that's so if I understand correctly 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.479
 today since jean said it so 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.729
 well just now the fans have 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.680
 so much helped bring back 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.259
 cities of gold by the great gate to the 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.610
 television there is possibility that the 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.589
 fans is therefore participating in the great adventure 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.759
 to build maybe a golden city 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.759
 with you but it is the goal
