00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.780
 configure 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.519
 there is a small sneak preview of one 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.720
 park new slides here 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.580
 slope 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.480
 this they will build in me this summer 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.029
 is it finished 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.019
 At least that's the planning comfort 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.220
 total 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.679
 489 meters of slide and a height of 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.119
 85 meters 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.380
 in short enough pleasure for it 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.000
 whole family 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.120
 there are a number of unique jobs 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.489
 between like multisite 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.770
 what you had with him goes like one 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.629
 freefall slide comes in between and one 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.350
 big extreme that is a big tires 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.399
 job for 130 meters and that is just ahead 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.079
 comparison 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.899
 just as long as actually longer 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.850
 nowadays than the tiki bath 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.649
 some families leading super closures 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.809
 in short, the wreath of fatigue 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.850
 and the starlight though they are 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.800
 140 meters 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.239
 so that is how long these jobs are 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.860
 so that can be quite intense in 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.460
 slope 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.619
 I wonder if must eventually 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.330
 look like setup 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.600
 so here comes the new slide park 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.920
 with elle slides and in the back the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 highest tower of 14 meters 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.329
 sharpener are becoming a big starting point 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.310
 which is quiet until the tower here is one 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.039
 being open-minded means that 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.229
 there occurs a heeswijk like this where 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.179
 you can see through it but not 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.649
 can climb over it 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.490
 yes not this fence these are equally temporary 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.459
 look 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.039
 smart guys there is no swimmer 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.740
 but there are well dug holes 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.649
 store in the water later 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.179
 can be added to the slides 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.479
 and on top of that the skin should 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.479
 lie 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.709
 these are concrete beams directed between 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.509
 concret in the so comes in support 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.629
 stand 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.470
 we stand there a lot together then becomes 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.720
 the big store with the most slides 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.460
 Here pieces from the dark learn the dog 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.130
 are not surprising but they are investing 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.360
 burrow job but this is also one 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.790
 tire job 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.790
 the builders 95 meters long 10 meters high 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.960
 these are pieces of the wacky wave that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.960
 is a 10 meter high 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.960
 semiconductor 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.680
 here is a rivoli that will be 20 meters long 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.490
 and 10 meters high belongs a free fall 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.900
 but they never slide into each other 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.580
 screws 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.600
 this orange slide becomes the two 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.750
 centro 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.320
 80 meter long 10 meters high in its 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.320
 bol die slight 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.680
 we just see the too after the twist that 60 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.790
 meters long it is a farmer who 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240
 site 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.040
 he could be the height of his half meter 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.260
 this will be the longest and the highest the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.200
 extreme shame that in extreme preparedness 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.590
 having mentioned is a minus point 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.709
 130 meters, the total will be 90 meters open 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:19.510
 and 40 meters in the dark with this one 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.459
 wonderful divisor is this will be right away 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.500
 a multi racer or a multisite 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.380
 that 45 meter long becomes a big one 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.820
 and 10 meters high and the special 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.230
 this job I was here with you immediately 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.670
 mat goes off 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.440
 so you immediately had to go for a derivative 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.000
 and that is still quite unique in this 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.959
 environment because they have it earlier 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.350
 seen 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.140
 at least I do not moreover 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.490
 enough place of alignment 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.280
 certainly a few slides are 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.140
 who also a few so this is just 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.750
 a basic package 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.990
 hopefully good knowledge beats one 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.030
 major more extreme intervention on the buildings 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.030
 from this summer to fully test this
