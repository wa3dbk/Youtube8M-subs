you want to pinch it put it in a little
bit<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.580> clamp<00:04:54.880> it<00:04:54.970> down<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.180> little<00:04:55.480> sad<00:04:55.840> title

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
bit and clamp it down a little sad title

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.450 
bit and clamp it down a little sad title
and<00:04:57.670> said<00:04:57.880> tight<00:04:58.150> these<00:04:58.390> pills<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.750> them<00:04:58.870> stay

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
and said tight these pills of them stay

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.580 
and said tight these pills of them stay
dry<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.760> can<00:05:01.300> put<00:05:01.540> matches<00:05:01.990> in<00:05:02.170> here<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:02.530> you

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
dry you can put matches in here and you

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.870 
dry you can put matches in here and you
can<00:05:02.710> put<00:05:02.830> strikers<00:05:03.310> in<00:05:03.490> here

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
can put strikers in here

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.120 
can put strikers in here
so<00:05:04.540> both<00:05:04.750> they'll<00:05:05.080> stay<00:05:05.320> dry<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.830> won't<00:05:05.980> go

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
so both they'll stay dry and it won't go

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.980 
so both they'll stay dry and it won't go
any<00:05:06.310> place<00:05:06.340> so<00:05:06.970> that's<00:05:07.330> how<00:05:07.480> you<00:05:07.540> make<00:05:07.780> this

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
this put this aside and you do it

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.200 
this put this aside and you do it
destroys<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:23.560> fill<00:06:23.830> it<00:06:23.950> up<00:06:24.010> with<00:06:24.070> pepper<00:06:24.670> salt

middle so it looks like so then you take

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.400 
middle so it looks like so then you take
that<00:06:47.700> half-inch<00:06:48.700> piece<00:06:49.000> you<00:06:49.180> cut<00:06:49.360> and<00:06:50.140> you<00:06:50.230> put
