00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
pulling that through you can also use

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.439 
pulling that through you can also use
some<00:05:47.949> pliers<00:05:48.159> at<00:05:48.520> this<00:05:48.669> point<00:05:48.939> but<00:05:49.060> point<00:05:49.330> the

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
some pliers at this point but point the

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.209 
some pliers at this point but point the
needle<00:05:49.750> down<00:05:49.930> so<00:05:50.259> you<00:05:50.349> don't<00:05:50.590> hurt<00:05:50.770> yourself

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
and then you just pull it right through
