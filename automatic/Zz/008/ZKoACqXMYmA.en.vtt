 hello and welcome back to all friends hd gioco.it dagospai gianni 84 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.189
 let's go today to see how to create ringtones for the problem is they do 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.189
 starting from your own brilliant music 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.810
 in this regard there are action games that do this work in an appstore 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.940
 hater ringtones designer home 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.400
 another you - onlus make extra 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.760
 us in this video guide to the admission provision a simple one 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.880
 utilization 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.840
 we are going to open the first one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 simple clean interface allows through counts as well on it's 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.410
 to select 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.110
 damn our song 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.110
 lovers 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.320
 we will have these are written 2e stink 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.480
 that sail 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.400
 in the long run 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 along our time 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.070
 song 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.410
 we can move this look at you 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.870
 but where you want I call to select i 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.830
 30 second to 46 version 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 add to select consultants 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.310
 ability to enable one wins cat 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.830
 opera fading into - dream town 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830
 example also before clicking on the brenta 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.260
 then we can once set up hairpin bends before adjusting 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.030
 let's say the time interval we want 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.970
 websites when they call us 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.030
 once chosen I have the one we like best 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.390
 we have two possibilities or then to save ours 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.979
 ringtone or select another by clicking on the note above a 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.549
 left 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.549
 in this case we make sandra 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:19.859
 and tells us that this case is longer to defend against our ringtone. 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.169
 to see what we did wrong in fact 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.199
 acqui 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.859
 let's save 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.339
 our family will automatically believe it 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:35.149
 after creating his yesterday we would need to hate tuns and show you 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.679
 comments on almia ago 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:42.059
 first, however, the best program warns us that the gelmini was to convert a 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.179
 success 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.219
 called ok 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.159
 before showing how it works with macaroons 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.209
 I leave the blissful ringtones maker application to see how it differs 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.259
 from the head 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.130
 also 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.600
 in this case that cleans up allows ita text 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.849
 insertional 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.849
 the song from our library 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.549
 in this case we simply have to choose it 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.849
 atlas 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.629
 the starting point of the song and the duration in seconds automatically yes 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.759
 the temporal space will change 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.629
 rt look and the duration of the song 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.810
 let's put a fine example that must start from the second 54 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:38.139
 okay we can also adjust exactly what at the beginning 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.239
 we want to wear 3s less with the start of the ringtone 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:48.540
 possibility to change ringtone to change reference music 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.779
 enable and disable meaning 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:56.099
 save ringtone enable advanced controls advanced controls 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.759
 to put the song in practice we have the possibility 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.349
 to increase the pin there is the speed of the launch the pc turns on what it is 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.349
 now we have put the principle 2 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.459
 sip 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.249
 and then we can make do with 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.249
 speed 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.669
 in order to create truly personalized ringtones 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.059
 in this case we have 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.319
 as you have noticed a greater personalization of the south 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.439
 clear that here is healthy 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.439
 after a few seconds the Freemasonry was created this crazy 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.690
 here after a little more time than the president application 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.860
 It was created from a dream 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.860
 now let's go out and go through the arch 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.509
 so let's now connect our baked to itunes 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.129
 she 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.879
 once connected we wait for that 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.549
 but the consortium completes the synchronization 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.559
 once the synchronization is complete we are on the same positive I hope on 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.809
 our 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.379
 men 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.599
 we have Milan we go to the application screen 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.779
 at the bottom we have to adjust the document sharing box 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.210
 in this case, another tax will pass on the Tim Burton's house 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.620
 sim transmitter 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.030
 select the song we want to save as a ringtone partner we can 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.810
 select snake 2 by holding down the command button on the andrix keyboard 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.729
 both song 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.729
 faress in the wind 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.059
 English Italian Hindi text 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.909
 mESSINA 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.150
 saved the violations on the desk we move to save also the one created 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:18.149
 from ringtones 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.169
 what to say to have the star star 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.650
 tonight on rai 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.650
 finalists 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:35.549
 drag up list tomatos and announces settle in the category 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:41.509
 the solitude of a day a drunken foundation s.ludes this 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.699
 last hours are those referring to the white trans 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.969
 this is how you are 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.419
 so let's just do the synchronization again, let's go into slabs 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.119
 masonry 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:58.599
 let's sync away 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.180
 we remain judith all the probes 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.180
 let's chew her 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:11.330
 let's see then you complete the synchronization in this case not 

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:14.319
 will cover all the tickets I already had business 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.350
 created 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.259
 here is that completed the synchronization we go to see the rossoneri and soul 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:23.259
 A Place in the Sun 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.280
 come back that I'm in school ford we won't have to do anything else that can in our street 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.460
 villa manin 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.869
 so just go to sound settings 

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:36.330
 ringer 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
 select the ringtone you just created 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:47.400
