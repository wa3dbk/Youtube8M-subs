 play megaman x 3 a game that what 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.550
 I loved the same staff as the mx1 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.310
 the 2 I could not pass it completely because it 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.840
 damaged the fucking cassette of the time and 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.430
 fucking mother equal comparison was 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.910
 complicated so let's enjoy the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.910
 sound 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.660
 I love the sound of play 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.670
 but what I liked most about these 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.090
 pinches games of the time if it was a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.890
 thing that I who possessed the one who tells me 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.890
 Music will zero everything plan 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.750
 plan white ex defeat of water here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.260
 outside when it says to defeat the law 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.530
 bad that egg forward and attacks from 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.740
 inside and we attack from inside him 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.610

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 boots if I remember correctly so look 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.600

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.360
 peeling not one of peladito could be 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.940

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.190
 I'm not going to know my little boy that I'm going to 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.659

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.200

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.430

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.210

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.100
 happen 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.840
 because in the x2 I did not know that you can 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.790
 use 0 knowing the parts was 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.740
 one thing that I did not know because I did not 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.530

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.400

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.400

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:56.490
 Huge damage 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:56.490

 on top of everything with plan you are a garbage 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.160

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.240
 I wanted is that I had strong feelings 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.240

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.239
 miniature the cars and all those things 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.769

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.769

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.720
 this chapter we are going to bring this and 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.340
 I think they tell me if they like this 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.560
 series if they want their bat to be more 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.020

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.490
 respect and well this is nothing we see the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.590
 next chapter I do not suppose because 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.729
 I think an animation right now and a 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.089
 guys that were poorly focused 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.039
 and with colors to fuck seen on 0 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.139
 I had to get here to tell me what is 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.560

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.110

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.319
 you're going to have there is the head and so 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.969
 the guys talking I do not think that was that 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:05:01.090
