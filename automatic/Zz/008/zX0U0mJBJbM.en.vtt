00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620

England<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.190> tournament<00:00:14.490> because<00:00:14.849> came

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
England at this tournament because came

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.290 
England at this tournament because came
here<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.660> very<00:00:15.839> little<00:00:16.020> expectation

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
here with very little expectation

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.580 
here with very little expectation
particularly<00:00:18.300> high<00:00:18.420> hopes<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:19.020> after<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
particularly high hopes but after the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.720 
particularly high hopes but after the
three<00:00:19.800> group<00:00:20.010> games<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.369> suddenly<00:00:20.550> thought

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
three group games I suddenly thought

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.189 
three group games I suddenly thought
hang<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.420> we've<00:00:21.510> got<00:00:21.600> seven<00:00:21.810> points<00:00:22.080> out

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
hang on it we've got seven points out

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.050 
hang on it we've got seven points out
nine<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.769> top<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.039> group<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.460> thought<00:00:23.970> we

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
nine here we top the group I thought we

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
nine here we top the group I thought we
could<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.359> something<00:00:24.600> we'll<00:00:25.140> stay<00:00:25.320> over<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
could do something we'll stay over the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019 
could do something we'll stay over the
game<00:00:25.650> against<00:00:25.859> France<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.400> watched<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.760> just

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
was I was happy with the point I've got

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.610 
was I was happy with the point I've got
to<00:00:33.840> say<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.200> didn't<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.590> played

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to say but I didn't think we played

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
to say but I didn't think we played
particularly<00:00:35.130> well<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
particularly well and then we get to the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110 
particularly well and then we get to the
second<00:00:37.020> game<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.489> after<00:00:38.730> Andy

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
second game we go to one down after Andy

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
second game we go to one down after Andy
Carroll<00:00:39.390> scores<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> cracker<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
Carroll scores a cracker and then we

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.990 
Carroll scores a cracker and then we
come<00:00:41.070> back<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.219> win<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> game<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:41.730> that's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
come back and win the game now that's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.549 
come back and win the game now that's
the<00:00:42.120> game<00:00:42.270> where<00:00:42.480> my<00:00:42.600> opinion<00:00:43.050> shifted<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the game where my opinion shifted I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
the game where my opinion shifted I
thought<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.340> England<00:00:44.789> could<00:00:45.030> go

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
thought you know what England could go

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
thought you know what England could go
and<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.960> tournament<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and do some it at this tournament and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
and do some it at this tournament and
then<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> rather<00:00:47.579> flukey<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.120> nil<00:00:48.300> win

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
then we get a rather flukey one nil win

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
then we get a rather flukey one nil win
against<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> Ukraine<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.710> soil<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.460> should

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
against the Ukraine I'm soil they should

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
against the Ukraine I'm soil they should
beaten<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.180> really<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.440> got<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> victory

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

quarter-final against Italy and Kiev I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
went to the game and you know what I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.709 
went to the game and you know what I
don't<00:00:59.730> think<00:00:59.850> we're<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.090> bad<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.359> people<00:01:00.690> say

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
don't think we're as bad as people say

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't think we're as bad as people say
they<00:01:01.230> said<00:01:01.440> Italy<00:01:02.370> battered<00:01:02.730> asst<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
they said Italy battered asst there's a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
they said Italy battered asst there's a
lot<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> chances<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.379> was<00:01:04.559> true<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:04.979> there

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
lot of chances which was true but there

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
lot of chances which was true but there
were<00:01:05.189> long<00:01:05.369> ranges<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.689> kept<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
were long ranges and we kept them all in

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
were long ranges and we kept them all in
at<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.619> hundred<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> twenty<00:01:08.159> minutes<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
at one hundred and twenty minutes and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.000 
at one hundred and twenty minutes and
Italy<00:01:08.790> didn't<00:01:09.119> score<00:01:09.450> against<00:01:09.900> us<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Italy didn't score against us so the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.289 
Italy didn't score against us so the
other<00:01:11.130> end<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> couple<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> chances

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
other end we had a couple of chances

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.820 
other end we had a couple of chances
Glen<00:01:12.689> Johnson<00:01:12.869> should<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.350> school<00:01:13.560> Wayne

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
Glen Johnson should have school Wayne

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
Glen Johnson should have school Wayne
Rooney's<00:01:14.130> over<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.460> kick<00:01:14.640> he<00:01:14.760> probably<00:01:14.970> would

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
Rooney's over at kick he probably would

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
Rooney's over at kick he probably would
have<00:01:15.270> school<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.600> Man<00:01:15.720> United<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.310> out

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
have school for Man United and we go out

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.179 
have school for Man United and we go out
on<00:01:17.490> penalties<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.270> course<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:19.530> always<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
on penalties of course that's always the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.100 
on penalties of course that's always the
case<00:01:20.340> isn't<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.299> overall<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:21.900> we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
case isn't it so overall I think we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.499 
case isn't it so overall I think we
exceeded<00:01:22.470> expectations<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.700> actually<00:01:24.330> going

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
exceeded expectations but actually going

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.120 
exceeded expectations but actually going
out<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> point<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.439> way<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.770> did<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
out at that point in the way we did a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
out at that point in the way we did a
little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.790> disappointing<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.750> England's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
little bit disappointing so England's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440 
little bit disappointing so England's
tournament<00:01:29.220> I'd<00:01:29.340> probably<00:01:29.670> give<00:01:29.970> us<00:01:30.090> seven

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
tournament I'd probably give us seven

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179
