to show you quickly how I determine the
consistency<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.000> my<00:00:12.210> royal<00:00:12.480> icing<00:00:12.870> our<00:00:13.830> usual

that I do and I need different
consistencies<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.680> different<00:00:20.039> jobs<00:00:20.279> for

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
consistencies for different jobs for

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.029 
consistencies for different jobs for
instance<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.480> lovely<00:00:22.109> smooth<00:00:22.380> cookies<00:00:22.830> I

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
instance for lovely smooth cookies I

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.029 
instance for lovely smooth cookies I
need<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> thinner<00:00:23.550> mix<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:25.080> piping<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.830> have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
need a thinner mix and for piping I have

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.089 
need a thinner mix and for piping I have
to<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.609> stiffer<00:00:27.180> mix<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.260> I've<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.830> mixed

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
to need a stiffer mix so I've just mixed

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.299 
to need a stiffer mix so I've just mixed
up<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.340> royal<00:00:29.580> icing<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.679> very<00:00:31.679> easy<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.160> do

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
up this royal icing here very easy to do

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.470 
up this royal icing here very easy to do
just<00:00:32.669> icing<00:00:33.570> sugar<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> egg<00:00:34.649> egg<00:00:35.040> white<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
just icing sugar and egg egg white and I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840 
just icing sugar and egg egg white and I
tend<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.140> pasteurized<00:00:38.070> egg<00:00:38.520> white<00:00:38.700> which

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
tend to use pasteurized egg white which

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
tend to use pasteurized egg white which
you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.090> buy<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.270> boxes<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:40.280> reconstituted

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you can buy in boxes or reconstituted

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
you can buy in boxes or reconstituted
egg<00:00:41.460> white<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:41.940> powder<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.379> safety

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
egg white from powder just for safety

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
egg white from powder just for safety
reasons<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.280> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> start<00:00:45.510> off<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:45.719> around

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
reasons but if you start off with around

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.350 
reasons but if you start off with around
150<00:00:46.649> grams<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> icing<00:00:47.160> sugar<00:00:47.489> per<00:00:47.850> egg<00:00:48.090> white

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
150 grams of icing sugar per egg white

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.020 
150 grams of icing sugar per egg white
then<00:00:49.079> you're<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.039> too<00:00:50.370> far<00:00:50.670> off<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
then you're not too far off and you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.250 
then you're not too far off and you
probably<00:00:51.360> only<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> add<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> little

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
probably only just have to add a little

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.810 
probably only just have to add a little
bit<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.559> icing<00:00:53.010> sugar<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> right

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
bit more icing sugar to get to the right

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.510 
bit more icing sugar to get to the right
consistency<00:00:54.320> also<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> added<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.100> touch<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
consistency also I added a touch of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
consistency also I added a touch of
lemon<00:00:56.640> juice<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:58.079> consistency<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
lemon juice in here the consistency of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
lemon juice in here the consistency of
the<00:00:59.160> royal<00:00:59.309> icing<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.239> important

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the royal icing is really important

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
the royal icing is really important
because<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.890> cookies<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.090> nice

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
because for cookies I want it to be nice

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
because for cookies I want it to be nice
and<00:01:03.449> smooth<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.320> instance<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.769> I'm

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and smooth but for instance if I'm

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
and smooth but for instance if I'm
piping<00:01:05.369> borders<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.570> stiff

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
piping borders I want it to be stiff

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.920 
piping borders I want it to be stiff
enough<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> hold<00:01:07.380> its<00:01:07.560> shape<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.670> test<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
enough to hold its shape so I test the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.649 
enough to hold its shape so I test the
rocket<00:01:10.080> royal<00:01:10.470> icing<00:01:10.590> before<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> use<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.659> once

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
rocket royal icing before I use it once

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.480 
rocket royal icing before I use it once
I've<00:01:12.840> got<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> piping<00:01:13.619> bag<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I've got it in the piping bag it's a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.039 
I've got it in the piping bag it's a
real<00:01:14.729> pain<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.479> back<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.810> start

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
real pain to have to go back and start

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
real pain to have to go back and start
all<00:01:16.200> over<00:01:16.259> again<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.710> by<00:01:17.009> doing<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.520> way

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
all over again so by doing it this way

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
all over again so by doing it this way
you<00:01:17.790> make<00:01:18.090> sure<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.750> before<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you make sure that it's right before you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
you make sure that it's right before you
start<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.310> I'm<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.970> run<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
start so all I'm going to do is run a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810 
start so all I'm going to do is run a
knife<00:01:21.450> through<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> surface<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.830> watch<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
knife through the surface and watch the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 
knife through the surface and watch the
line<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> forms<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.619> comes

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
line that it forms and when that comes

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
line that it forms and when that comes
back<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> being<00:01:26.400> nice<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.790> flat<00:01:26.939> again<00:01:27.330> that's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
back to being nice and flat again that's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.929 
back to being nice and flat again that's
going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> tell<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.890> how<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.280> consistency<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
going to tell me how my consistency is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
going to tell me how my consistency is
so<00:01:30.770> one<00:01:31.939> two<00:01:32.939> three<00:01:33.470> four<00:01:35.390> five<00:01:36.500> six<00:01:37.500> and
