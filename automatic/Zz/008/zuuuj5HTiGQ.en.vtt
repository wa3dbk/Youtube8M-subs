about anything technical was about the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.300 
about anything technical was about the
Nexus<00:00:14.280> 4<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.780> doing<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.529> video<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.949> did

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
Nexus 4 and I was doing that video I did

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.519 
Nexus 4 and I was doing that video I did
I<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.730> video<00:00:18.029> sample<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> camera<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
I think a video sample of the camera and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
I think a video sample of the camera and
I<00:00:19.859> did<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> sample<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.480> differences

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
I did a sample of the the differences

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
I did a sample of the the differences
between<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.289> Nexus<00:00:22.590> 4's<00:00:22.859> display<00:00:23.400> versus

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
between the Nexus 4's display versus

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400 
between the Nexus 4's display versus
that<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.390> Galaxy<00:00:24.840> Nexus

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that of the Galaxy Nexus

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.950 
that of the Galaxy Nexus

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
comes to these settings let's go through

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.730 
comes to these settings let's go through
these<00:01:35.159> settings<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:36.590> let's<00:01:37.590> go

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
these settings a bit here let's go

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.340 
these settings a bit here let's go
through<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.250> display<00:01:39.119> settings<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.140> right

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
through these display settings all right

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.899 
through these display settings all right
now<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> brightness<00:01:41.340> set<00:01:41.670> too

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
now I don't have the brightness set too

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
now I don't have the brightness set too
high<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.659> brightness<00:01:43.049> maybe<00:01:43.290> at

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
high I think the brightness maybe at

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
high I think the brightness maybe at
about<00:01:43.619> about<00:01:44.340> 20%<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> auto

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
about about 20% it's not on auto

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
about about 20% it's not on auto
brightness<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.649> drawn<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
brightness so it's not drawn from the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
brightness so it's not drawn from the
ambient<00:01:48.060> lighting<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.540> anything<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
ambient lighting or anything I have it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
ambient lighting or anything I have it
on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> Wi-Fi<00:01:50.490> network<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.180> home<00:01:51.450> right

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

now

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
now

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.590 
now
simply<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.149> searching

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
simply because I don't want it searching

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.310 
simply because I don't want it searching
for<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> decent<00:01:55.770> LTE<00:01:56.399> signal<00:01:56.850> where<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> live<00:01:58.049> so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
for a decent LTE signal where I live so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
for a decent LTE signal where I live so
I<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.399> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.820> network<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
I can put it on my Wi-Fi network it's a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
I can put it on my Wi-Fi network it's a
pretty<00:02:00.659> reliable<00:02:00.890> connection<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.369> so

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
pretty reliable connection here and so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.490 
pretty reliable connection here and so
that's<00:02:03.180> why<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> Wi-Fi<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that's why I have the Wi-Fi on but the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.429 
that's why I have the Wi-Fi on but the
Bluetooth<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> everything<00:02:05.460> else<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.909> off

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
Bluetooth and everything else is off

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
Bluetooth and everything else is off
when<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.039> location<00:02:08.399> settings

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
when you go to the location settings

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.279 
when you go to the location settings
which<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.179> also<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
which is also where you can get a lot of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.600 
which is also where you can get a lot of
battery<00:02:10.590> drainage<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.160> far<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.520> GPS<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
battery drainage as far as GPS and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.730 
battery drainage as far as GPS and
things<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.090> checking<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.900> had<00:02:14.560> that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
my social media apps right now I have

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.620 
my social media apps right now I have
those<00:02:26.320> set<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.160> only<00:02:27.280> refresh<00:02:27.880> every<00:02:28.390> four

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
those set to only refresh every four

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.680 
those set to only refresh every four
hours<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.340> usually<00:02:30.340> they'll<00:02:30.700> refresh<00:02:31.420> when

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
hours and usually they'll refresh when

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.350 
hours and usually they'll refresh when
you<00:02:32.140> know<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.410> those<00:02:32.710> manually<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.850> don't

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you know I do those manually but I don't

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.210 
you know I do those manually but I don't
have<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.780> set<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.140> refresh<00:02:35.560> every<00:02:35.890> twenty

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
have it set to refresh every twenty

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.530 
have it set to refresh every twenty
minutes<00:02:36.520> every<00:02:36.760> hour<00:02:36.790> or<00:02:37.150> nothing<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:37.480> that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
minutes every hour or nothing like that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.740 
minutes every hour or nothing like that
so<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.620> should<00:02:39.070> be<00:02:39.160> seeing<00:02:39.400> more<00:02:39.760> than<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.540> five

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
so I should be seeing more than the five

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.710 
so I should be seeing more than the five
hours<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.260> battery<00:02:41.650> life<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.070> I'm<00:02:42.720> estimated

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
hours of battery life that I'm estimated

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.660 
hours of battery life that I'm estimated
to<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:44.020> if<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.680> left<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.010> phone<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.430> its<00:02:45.550> own

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670
