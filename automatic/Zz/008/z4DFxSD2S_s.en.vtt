00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
too hard I had a lot of trouble so I

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.729 
too hard I had a lot of trouble so I
figured<00:05:52.489> try<00:05:53.239> medium<00:05:53.659> and<00:05:53.929> it<00:05:54.469> turned<00:05:54.619> out

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:54.739 
figured try medium and it turned out

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:56.519 
figured try medium and it turned out
pretty<00:05:54.800> good<00:05:55.129> got<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.729> maximum<00:05:56.119> score

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
pretty good got the maximum score

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.979 
pretty good got the maximum score
because<00:05:57.529> I<00:05:57.709> wasn't<00:05:58.009> about<00:05:58.129> to<00:05:58.569> go<00:05:59.569> without

00:05:59.979 --> 00:05:59.989

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:01.929 
because I wasn't about to go without
getting<00:06:00.289> a<00:06:00.469> maximum<00:06:00.889> score<00:06:01.069> that<00:06:01.610> would<00:06:01.699> just

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:01.939 
getting a maximum score that would just

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.719 
getting a maximum score that would just
be<00:06:02.059> silly<00:06:02.299> but<00:06:03.199> anyway<00:06:03.559> this<00:06:03.860> has<00:06:04.129> been<00:06:04.369> let's
