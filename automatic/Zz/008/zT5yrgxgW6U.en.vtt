of<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.159> just<00:00:56.460> suck<00:00:56.789> everything<00:00:57.269> up<00:00:57.629> like

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of this and just suck everything up like

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
of this and just suck everything up like
a<00:00:58.109> sponge<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.249> something<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.640> going

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
a sponge so that's something I'm going

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.869 
a sponge so that's something I'm going
to<00:00:59.850> try<00:01:00.089> out<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.659> see<00:01:01.069> how<00:01:02.069> well<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.309> works<00:01:02.460> for

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to try out and see how well it works for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.919 
to try out and see how well it works for
me<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.300> something<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.749> you<00:01:03.809> can

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
me so that's something that you can

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.000 
me so that's something that you can
definitely<00:01:04.080> try<00:01:04.470> yourself

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
definitely try yourself

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
definitely try yourself
and<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.580> gives<00:01:05.790> gives<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> another<00:01:06.690> goal<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and it gives gives you another goal to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:21.310 
and it gives gives you another goal to
work<00:01:07.440> towards

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.200 

today<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.470> another<00:01:22.680> DTP<00:01:23.340> training<00:01:23.790> day<00:01:23.940> and

our last date their transformation will

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
our last date their transformation will
be<00:01:26.430> starting<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.120> hamstring<00:01:27.720> curls

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
electrical machine so I did that last

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
night

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.439 
night
and<00:04:29.539> I'm<00:04:30.539> doing<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> immediately<00:04:31.320> after<00:04:31.860> my

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
and I'm doing it immediately after my

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.820 
and I'm doing it immediately after my
workout<00:04:33.449> now<00:04:33.660> because<00:04:34.289> I've<00:04:34.410> got<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.590> photo

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
workout now because I've got a photo

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.010 
workout now because I've got a photo
shoot<00:04:35.100> so<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.310> got<00:04:35.490> shooter<00:04:35.820> clients<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:36.690> about

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
shoot so I got shooter clients in about

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.420 
shoot so I got shooter clients in about
30<00:04:37.289> minutes<00:04:37.620> here<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.889> I<00:04:38.039> figured<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.400> could

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
30 minutes here so I figured I could

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.810 
30 minutes here so I figured I could
just<00:04:38.580> get<00:04:38.850> in<00:04:38.970> my<00:04:39.000> cardio<00:04:39.449> quickly<00:04:39.840> now<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.820> so

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
just get in my cardio quickly now and so

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.390 
just get in my cardio quickly now and so
obviously<00:04:42.150> with<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.419> ankle<00:04:42.750> injury<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.440> can't

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
obviously with the ankle injury I can't

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.460 
obviously with the ankle injury I can't
do<00:04:44.550> any<00:04:44.699> pressing<00:04:45.240> movements<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:46.110> that's<00:04:46.289> why

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
do any pressing movements so that's why

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.340 
do any pressing movements so that's why
I<00:04:46.500> repeated<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.160> DTP<00:04:47.729> system<00:04:48.150> again<00:04:48.419> super

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
I repeated the DTP system again super

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.860

setting the leg extensions with the
hamstring<00:04:52.349> curls<00:04:52.699> so<00:04:53.699> not<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:54.000> put<00:04:54.210> any

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
hamstring curls so not to put any

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.290
