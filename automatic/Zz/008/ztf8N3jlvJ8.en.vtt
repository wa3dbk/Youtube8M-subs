time<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.600> these<00:02:27.600> aren't<00:02:27.870> soldered<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:29.040> you're

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
time but these aren't soldered if you're

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.150 
time but these aren't soldered if you're
looking<00:02:29.460> real<00:02:29.670> close<00:02:29.910> they're<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.240> soldered

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
looking real close they're not soldered

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.360 
looking real close they're not soldered
they're<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.370> put<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.060> twisted

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
they're just put in there and twisted

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
they're just put in there and twisted
lucky<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.580> came<00:02:35.790> right<00:02:35.910> out<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:37.080> got<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> be

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
lucky I came right out you got to be

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.870 
lucky I came right out you got to be
very<00:02:37.410> careful<00:02:37.980> though<00:02:38.100> he's<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.280> this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
very careful though he's just this

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.320 
very careful though he's just this
little<00:02:40.010> little<00:02:41.010> little<00:02:41.520> copper<00:02:41.910> thing<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.300> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
little little little copper thing with a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.500 
little little little copper thing with a
hole<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.400> tough<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.120> damage

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
hole in it it's not tough to to damage

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.440 
hole in it it's not tough to to damage
these<00:02:46.550> come<00:02:47.550> look<00:02:47.790> at<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:49.070> okay

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
these come look at this one here okay

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.760 
these come look at this one here okay
yeah<00:02:51.450> he<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.780> bend<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.440> twist<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.739> around

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
yeah he just bend and twist it around

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.010 
yeah he just bend and twist it around
there<00:02:53.100> no<00:02:53.250> solder<00:02:53.550> your<00:02:54.480> solder<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.930> he'd

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
there no solder your solder and he'd

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.650 
there no solder your solder and he'd
take<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> chance<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:56.180> ruining<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.420> coil

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
take a chance of ruining the coil

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.330 
take a chance of ruining the coil
because<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> wires<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.800> there<00:02:58.980> are<00:02:59.100> so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
because what the wires in there are so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.170 
because what the wires in there are so
very<00:02:59.790> small<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.750> know<00:03:01.430> what<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.730> coil<00:03:03.000> in

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
very small you know what if the coil in

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.420 
very small you know what if the coil in
excellent<00:03:03.510> shape<00:03:03.980> okay<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> only<00:03:05.160> thing<00:03:05.340> that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
excellent shape okay the only thing that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.290 
excellent shape okay the only thing that
holds<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.320> these<00:03:07.320> two<00:03:07.530> screws<00:03:07.860> here

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.830 

take<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.510> out

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.010 

I'll<00:03:19.380> be<00:03:19.560> screws<00:03:19.830> they're<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.070> good<00:03:20.190> shape<00:03:20.430> to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
I'll be screws they're in good shape to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.780 
I'll be screws they're in good shape to
you<00:03:22.020> know<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.230> at<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.380> touch<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:23.460> um<00:03:23.640> they're

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you know it at the touch it's um they're

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.720 
you know it at the touch it's um they're
the<00:03:23.970> tops<00:03:24.540> aren't<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:26.130> butter<00:03:26.370> would<00:03:26.610> or

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
the tops aren't in butter would or

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.520 
the tops aren't in butter would or
nothing

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
nothing

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.600 
nothing
okay<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:29.340> already<00:03:29.490> in<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.730> holds<00:03:30.000> ascent<00:03:31.610> okay

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
okay it's already in a holds ascent okay

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.760 
okay it's already in a holds ascent okay
now<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> can't<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.390> can't<00:03:34.320> take<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.590> out<00:03:34.650> right

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
now I can't I can't take it out right

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.949 
now I can't I can't take it out right
now<00:03:34.920> because<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.220> still<00:03:35.400> hook<00:03:35.520> up<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
now because it still hook up to the the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.500 
now because it still hook up to the the
condenser<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:38.180> capacitor<00:03:39.180> whatever<00:03:39.420> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
condenser here capacitor whatever you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.490 
condenser here capacitor whatever you
want<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.720> call<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.760> let<00:03:42.360> me<00:03:42.470> let<00:03:43.470> me

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
want to call it so let me let me

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.210 
want to call it so let me let me
disconnect<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:45.110> it's<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.640> 5/16<00:03:47.959> yeah

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
disconnect that it's like a 5/16 yeah

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.620 
disconnect that it's like a 5/16 yeah
okay<00:03:52.610> we'll<00:03:53.610> check<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:54.030> while<00:03:54.239> we<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.480> it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
okay we'll check this while we have it

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.630 
okay we'll check this while we have it
out<00:03:56.090> should<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.150> around<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.110> think<00:03:58.640> 20

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
out should be around the I think 20

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.760 
out should be around the I think 20
micro<00:03:59.940> farad's<00:04:00.330> or<00:04:00.450> something<00:04:02.150> okay<00:04:03.770> that

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
micro farad's or something okay that

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.250 
micro farad's or something okay that
comes<00:04:05.010> out<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.450> got<00:04:06.600> one<00:04:06.750> wire<00:04:06.930> here<00:04:07.230> that

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
comes out so you got one wire here that

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.770 
comes out so you got one wire here that
goes<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.650> your<00:04:07.709> points<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.420> other<00:04:09.450> wire

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
goes to your points and the other wire

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.400 
goes to your points and the other wire
goes<00:04:10.140> goes<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.950> coil<00:04:11.600> see<00:04:12.600> now<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.050> should

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
goes goes to the coil see now I should

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.900 
goes goes to the coil see now I should
be<00:04:13.470> able<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.650> slip<00:04:13.770> right<00:04:13.950> out<00:04:14.100> while<00:04:14.370> you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
be able to slip right out while you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.789 
be able to slip right out while you
still<00:04:14.940> got<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.300> ground<00:04:15.570> here<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:19.350> ground<00:04:19.620> to

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
still got the ground here the ground to

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.450 
still got the ground here the ground to
the<00:04:19.890> coil<00:04:21.350> goes<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.650> mounting<00:04:23.040> base<00:04:23.220> of

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the coil goes to the mounting base of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.350 
the coil goes to the mounting base of
the<00:04:23.550> capacitor<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.770> it's<00:04:25.770> tough<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.360> show

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
the capacitor here it's tough to show

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.310 
the capacitor here it's tough to show
you<00:04:27.419> what's<00:04:27.570> going<00:04:27.840> on<00:04:27.930> here<00:04:28.169> while

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
you what's going on here while

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.140 
you what's going on here while
unscrewing<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:29.960> but<00:04:30.960> no<00:04:31.080> my<00:04:31.200> best<00:04:31.940> all<00:04:32.940> right

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
unscrewing it but no my best all right

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.700 
unscrewing it but no my best all right
here's<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.430> other<00:04:35.430> mounting<00:04:35.910> screw<00:04:36.680> put<00:04:37.680> a

here's the other mounting screw put a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.330 
here's the other mounting screw put a
capacitor

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
capacitor

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.790 
capacitor
we'll<00:04:38.790> take<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.120> out

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.890 

and<00:04:45.370> here<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.610> go<00:04:45.759> that's<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.650> capacitor

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
and here we go that's that you capacitor

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.230 
and here we go that's that you capacitor
all<00:04:49.900> right<00:04:50.199> Edison<00:04:50.680> now<00:04:51.280> this<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.610> disconnect

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:54.809 
on by this little spring clip here you

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.889 
on by this little spring clip here you
take<00:05:55.020> that<00:05:55.139> off<00:05:55.969> that<00:05:56.969> takes<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.360> points<00:05:57.749> off

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:57.899 
take that off that takes the points off

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:02.359 
take that off that takes the points off
it'll<00:05:58.649> give<00:05:58.770> us<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.949> better<00:05:58.979> looking<00:06:01.249> that<00:06:02.249> all

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:21.059 
little clip we got here which holds the

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.320 
little clip we got here which holds the
middle<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.419> base<00:06:21.599> on<00:06:21.869> and<00:06:22.999> and<00:06:23.999> that's<00:06:24.149> it

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
middle of the base on and and that's it

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.540

it's pretty clear you still got this
grommet<00:06:27.360> here<00:06:27.599> but<00:06:27.869> I<00:06:27.930> got<00:06:28.289> a<00:06:28.349> new<00:06:28.589> one<00:06:28.709> on<00:06:28.919> the

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
grommet here but I got a new one on the

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.109 
grommet here but I got a new one on the
one<00:06:29.610> a<00:06:29.639> new<00:06:29.849> piece<00:06:31.520> you<00:06:32.520> got<00:06:32.639> the<00:06:32.789> two<00:06:32.909> grommets

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:33.119 
one a new piece you got the two grommets

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.920 
one a new piece you got the two grommets
and<00:06:33.689> then<00:06:34.459> this<00:06:35.459> here<00:06:35.699> just<00:06:35.879> this<00:06:36.029> little<00:06:36.270> this

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
and then this here just this little this

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.209 
and then this here just this little this
isn't<00:06:37.229> a<00:06:37.259> gas<00:06:37.469> core<00:06:37.680> anything<00:06:37.949> it's<00:06:38.069> actually

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 
isn't a gas core anything it's actually

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.639 
isn't a gas core anything it's actually
insulator<00:06:38.789> you<00:06:39.719> have<00:06:39.899> to<00:06:40.050> have<00:06:40.169> this<00:06:40.439> because

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:40.649 
insulator you have to have this because

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.790 
insulator you have to have this because
it<00:06:40.949> keeps<00:06:41.129> your<00:06:41.309> points<00:06:41.639> from<00:06:41.699> grounding<00:06:42.149> out

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
it keeps your points from grounding out

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.040 
it keeps your points from grounding out
I'm<00:06:43.800> going<00:06:43.979> to<00:06:44.009> take<00:06:44.159> this<00:06:44.339> off<00:06:44.580> just<00:06:44.999> to<00:06:45.990> show
