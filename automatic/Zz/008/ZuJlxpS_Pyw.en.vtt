the
on<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.130> ball-joint<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:12.910> then<00:02:13.510> there's<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
on a ball-joint and then there's a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.580 
on a ball-joint and then there's a
swivel<00:02:14.170> joint<00:02:14.790> arms<00:02:15.790> are<00:02:16.200> jointed<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.410> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
swivel joint arms are jointed so that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.339 
swivel joint arms are jointed so that
you<00:02:17.739> have<00:02:18.090> outwards<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.270> inwards<00:02:19.390> motion<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
you have outwards and inwards motion and

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.490 
you have outwards and inwards motion and
then<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:21.069> swivel<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.840> there's<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.110> swivel

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
then a swivel then there's a swivel

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.180 
then a swivel then there's a swivel
joint<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> upper<00:02:24.280> arm<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:25.680> double<00:02:26.680> joint<00:02:26.950> at

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
joint on the upper arm a double joint at

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.780 
joint on the upper arm a double joint at
the<00:02:27.370> elbow<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.120> near<00:02:28.360> 90<00:02:28.810> degree<00:02:29.080> rotation

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the elbow for near 90 degree rotation

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.720 
the elbow for near 90 degree rotation
each<00:02:30.790> arm<00:02:31.209> has<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:32.020> joint<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.800> here<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.489> allows

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
each arm has a joint in here that allows

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.540 
each arm has a joint in here that allows
swivel<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.780> wrist<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:36.130> another

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
swivel on the wrist and then another

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.250 
swivel on the wrist and then another
joint<00:02:36.910> here<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> wrist<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.110> can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
joint here on the wrist so that it can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.220 
joint here on the wrist so that it can
move<00:02:38.319> up<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.650> down<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:40.120> body<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.540> segmented

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
move up and down the body is segmented

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.820 
move up and down the body is segmented
so<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:43.300> poses<00:02:43.569> going<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.709> it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
so you can get some poses going and it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.880 
so you can get some poses going and it
does<00:02:45.040> turn<00:02:46.319> unfortunately<00:02:47.319> because<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
does turn unfortunately because of the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.340 
does turn unfortunately because of the
way<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.280> figure<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.940> molded<00:02:49.420> there<00:02:49.810> isn't<00:02:50.260> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
way the figure is molded there isn't a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.500 
way the figure is molded there isn't a
lot<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.590> wiggle<00:02:50.920> room<00:02:51.250> here<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.150> get

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
lot of wiggle room here but you can get

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.860 
lot of wiggle room here but you can get
some<00:02:52.540> which<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.170> better<00:02:53.470> than<00:02:53.680> none<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:55.510> legs

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
some which is better than none the legs

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.250 
some which is better than none the legs
are<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.549> are<00:02:57.549> exactly<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.299> hip<00:02:58.870> joints<00:02:59.170> are

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
are on are exactly the hip joints are

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.780 
are on are exactly the hip joints are
exactly<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.769> same<00:02:59.799> as<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.250> shoulder<00:03:00.549> joint

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
exactly the same as the shoulder joint

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.460 
exactly the same as the shoulder joint
so<00:03:00.970> you've<00:03:01.090> got<00:03:01.239> in-and-out<00:03:01.660> movement<00:03:02.290> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
so you've got in-and-out movement and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.610 
so you've got in-and-out movement and
then<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.160> more<00:03:03.910> ball<00:03:04.090> joint<00:03:04.420> swivel<00:03:05.410> at<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
then on a more ball joint swivel at the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.020 
then on a more ball joint swivel at the
top<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.100> leg<00:03:06.959> near<00:03:08.190> 90<00:03:09.190> degree<00:03:09.459> bend<00:03:09.730> at

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
top of the leg near 90 degree bend at

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.660 
top of the leg near 90 degree bend at
the<00:03:10.090> knee<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.390> double-jointed<00:03:11.319> knee<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.040> then

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
the knee so double-jointed knee and then

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.030 
the knee so double-jointed knee and then
the<00:03:12.880> ankle<00:03:13.360> has<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:14.170> joint<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.739> there's<00:03:14.980> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
the ankle has a joint and there's a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.130 
the ankle has a joint and there's a
little<00:03:15.370> bit<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.519> movement<00:03:15.880> back<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.720> forth<00:03:16.959> as

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
little bit of movement back and forth as

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.780 
little bit of movement back and forth as
well<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.400> figure<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:19.090> highly<00:03:19.900> poseable

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
well so this figure is highly poseable

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.690 
well so this figure is highly poseable

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
now the painting on the figure is

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.809 
now the painting on the figure is
top-notch<00:03:54.940> except<00:03:55.600> for<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.579> joints<00:03:57.579> the

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
top-notch except for the joints the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.440 
top-notch except for the joints the
joints<00:03:58.209> are<00:03:58.359> these<00:03:58.600> black<00:03:58.930> plastic<00:03:59.380> pieces

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
joints are these black plastic pieces

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.599 
joints are these black plastic pieces
instead<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.630> what<00:04:01.900> would<00:04:02.049> be<00:04:02.230> screws<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:03.040> some

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
instead of what would be screws in some

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.180 
instead of what would be screws in some
other<00:04:03.730> figures<00:04:04.350> but<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.590> don't<00:04:05.769> mind<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.160> so

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
other figures but I don't mind it so

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.410 
other figures but I don't mind it so
much<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.609> would<00:04:06.760> have<00:04:06.880> liked<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.299> seen

much I would have liked to have seen
them<00:04:07.840> these<00:04:08.350> bits<00:04:08.709> painted<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.750> possibly

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
them these bits painted and possibly

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.599 
them these bits painted and possibly
even<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.139> screw<00:04:11.470> holes<00:04:11.739> on<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.069> back<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.549> the

with a little bit of a on painted plan
stick<00:04:26.910> now<00:04:27.910> for<00:04:28.510> attaching<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.320> gauntlet<00:04:29.890> and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
stick now for attaching the gauntlet and

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.560 
stick now for attaching the gauntlet and
the<00:04:30.190> sword<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.550> omens<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:31.090> sword<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.420> omens

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
the sword of omens the sword of omens

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.160 
the sword of omens the sword of omens
itself<00:04:32.170> is<00:04:32.440> very<00:04:33.250> very<00:04:33.640> soft<00:04:34.030> plastic<00:04:34.750> which<00:04:34.960> I

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
itself is very very soft plastic which I

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.870 
itself is very very soft plastic which I
wish<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.950> little<00:04:36.220> bit<00:04:36.370> harder<00:04:36.700> but<00:04:36.820> I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
wish this was a little bit harder but I

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.570 
wish this was a little bit harder but I
understand<00:04:37.390> why<00:04:37.540> they<00:04:37.720> went<00:04:37.900> with<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.230> and

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
understand why they went with that and

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.070 
understand why they went with that and
you<00:04:39.580> could<00:04:39.700> just<00:04:39.910> plug<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.300> right<00:04:40.330> into<00:04:40.660> either

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
you could just plug it right into either

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.840 
you could just plug it right into either
hand<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:43.840> doesn't<00:04:44.170> stay<00:04:44.920> all<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.640> well

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
hand it doesn't stay all that well

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.400 
hand it doesn't stay all that well
sometimes<00:04:46.390> so<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.660> might<00:04:46.930> have<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.230> just

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
sometimes so you might have to just

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.770 
sometimes so you might have to just
fiddle<00:04:47.800> with<00:04:47.920> it<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.250> get<00:04:48.850> it<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.630> where

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
fiddle with it and get it to to where

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.750 
fiddle with it and get it to to where
you<00:04:49.900> want<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.260> but<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.890> both<00:04:51.130> hands<00:04:51.400> hold<00:04:51.670> the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
you want it but the both hands hold the

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.250 
you want it but the both hands hold the
sword<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.150> omens<00:04:52.270> just<00:04:52.780> fine

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
sword of omens just fine

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.150 
sword of omens just fine
now<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.950> Bartlett<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.990> gauntlet<00:04:55.990> is

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
now for the Bartlett the gauntlet is

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.890 
now for the Bartlett the gauntlet is
made<00:04:57.160> in<00:04:57.400> such<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.670> way<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.180> looks<00:04:58.480> like<00:04:58.690> it

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
made in such a way that it looks like it

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.330 
made in such a way that it looks like it
can<00:04:59.020> go<00:04:59.080> on<00:04:59.350> both<00:04:59.560> hands<00:04:59.830> but<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.130> really

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
can go on both hands but it really

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.520 
can go on both hands but it really
should<00:05:00.640> go<00:05:00.790> on<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.030> figures<00:05:01.330> left<00:05:01.600> hand<00:05:01.930> so

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
should go on the figures left hand so

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.320 
should go on the figures left hand so
what<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.740> do<00:05:02.920> is<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.130> grab<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.550> hand<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.120> you

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
what you do is you grab the hand and you

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.770 
what you do is you grab the hand and you
just<00:05:04.570> yank<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:04.960> off<00:05:05.170> leaving<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.340> stub

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
just yank it off leaving a stub

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.170 
just yank it off leaving a stub
literally<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.140> plug<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.160> into<00:05:09.850> the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
literally and you plug that into the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.990 
literally and you plug that into the
stub<00:05:10.480> now<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:11.470> smaller<00:05:11.890> sword<00:05:12.340> of<00:05:12.460> omens<00:05:12.580> can

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
stub now the smaller sword of omens can

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.690 
stub now the smaller sword of omens can
also<00:05:13.150> fit<00:05:13.660> in<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.290> larger<00:05:15.480> gauntlet<00:05:16.480> as<00:05:16.600> well

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
also fit in the larger gauntlet as well

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.580 
also fit in the larger gauntlet as well
so<00:05:18.700> you<00:05:18.790> could<00:05:19.090> have<00:05:19.300> lion-o<00:05:20.020> holding<00:05:20.500> the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
so you could have lion-o holding the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.260 
so you could have lion-o holding the
gauntlet<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.220> then<00:05:21.400> going<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.790> draw<00:05:22.120> his

the grapple action that the original
shows<00:05:43.390> dawa<00:05:43.750> had<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:44.500> this<00:05:45.070> gauntlet<00:05:45.340> looks
