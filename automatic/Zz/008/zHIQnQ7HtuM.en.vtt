and and for me personally just to know
to<00:01:38.579> try<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.819> get<00:01:38.999> to<00:01:39.060> play<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> woman<00:01:39.299> who<00:01:39.689> really

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
to try to get to play a woman who really

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.899 
to try to get to play a woman who really
existed<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.469> period<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.219> it's

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
existed in that period when we know it's

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.459 
existed in that period when we know it's
relatively<00:01:42.389> so<00:01:42.569> little<00:01:42.869> about<00:01:42.960> what<00:01:43.200> women's

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
relatively so little about what women's

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.510 
relatively so little about what women's
lives<00:01:43.649> were<00:01:43.889> like<00:01:44.039> that<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.490> really

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
lives were like that was really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
lives were like that was really
appealing<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.539> me<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.289> was<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.469> world

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
appealing to me I think it was a world

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.969 
appealing to me I think it was a world
that<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.490> thought<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.850> knew<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that I only thought I knew and it was a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.709 
that I only thought I knew and it was a
much<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.219> exotic<00:01:50.789> world<00:01:50.999> than<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.359> thought<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
much more exotic world than I thought I

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.449 
much more exotic world than I thought I
expected<00:01:52.380> when<00:01:52.499> I<00:01:52.530> read<00:01:52.709> Alexander<00:01:53.159> roses

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.120 
that that was an image he himself strove
to<00:04:31.330> create<00:04:31.840> because<00:04:32.050> he<00:04:32.290> knew<00:04:32.470> he<00:04:32.650> needed<00:04:32.950> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
people who were very ambivalent about it

people who were very ambivalent about it

in our in our main hero was Abraham wood
hall<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.500> saw<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.950> there<00:05:03.070> was<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.220> place<00:05:03.430> for<00:05:03.460> me

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
hall I saw that there was a place for me

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.969 
hall I saw that there was a place for me
back<00:05:04.090> then<00:05:04.330> where<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:05.290> could<00:05:05.500> imagine<00:05:05.740> myself

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
back then where I could imagine myself

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.770 
back then where I could imagine myself
wanting<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.790> stay<00:05:07.000> out<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.180> things<00:05:07.540> and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
wanting to stay out of things and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.690 
wanting to stay out of things and
eventually<00:05:08.169> being<00:05:08.320> pushed<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.889> action<00:05:09.310> for

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
eventually being pushed to action for

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.980 
eventually being pushed to action for
such<00:05:09.910> a<00:05:09.940> long<00:05:10.150> time<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.539> English<00:05:10.630> just

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
such a long time the English just

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.510 
such a long time the English just
assumed<00:05:11.320> they<00:05:11.560> were<00:05:11.620> gonna<00:05:11.860> win<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:12.130> mean<00:05:12.400> they

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
assumed they were gonna win I mean they

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520 
assumed they were gonna win I mean they
didn't<00:05:12.789> think<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.150> Americans<00:05:13.600> had<00:05:13.810> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
didn't think that Americans had the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.430 
didn't think that Americans had the
military<00:05:14.890> power<00:05:15.130> or<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.030> ingenuity<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.840> win

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
military power or the ingenuity to win

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.990 
military power or the ingenuity to win
or<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.860> fight<00:05:18.070> for<00:05:18.280> what<00:05:18.400> they<00:05:18.430> wanted<00:05:18.910> and

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
or to fight for what they wanted and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.240 
or to fight for what they wanted and
actually<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:19.720> think<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.289> British<00:05:20.620> presence<00:05:20.890> in

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
actually I think the British presence in

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.000 
actually I think the British presence in
in<00:05:21.490> America<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.419> started<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:23.440> work<00:05:23.560> against

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
in America it started to work against

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.159 
in America it started to work against
itself<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.490> started<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:25.060> be<00:05:25.300> evidence<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.930> our

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
itself it started to be evidence of our

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.080 
itself it started to be evidence of our
oppression<00:05:26.500> or<00:05:26.979> Americans<00:05:27.490> oppression<00:05:27.940> and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
oppression or Americans oppression and

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.150 
oppression or Americans oppression and
so<00:05:28.240> you<00:05:28.960> know<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.320> fact<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.800> soldier

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
so you know the fact that the soldier

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.770 
so you know the fact that the soldier
was<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.669> your<00:05:30.850> house<00:05:31.030> eating<00:05:31.450> your<00:05:31.570> food

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
able to govern it so yeah yeah but the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.650 
able to govern it so yeah yeah but the
COPE<00:05:41.289> the<00:05:41.560> culper<00:05:41.889> ring<00:05:41.919> was<00:05:42.550> responsible<00:05:43.330> for

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
COPE the culper ring was responsible for

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.110 
COPE the culper ring was responsible for
some<00:05:44.440> huge<00:05:45.070> accomplishments<00:05:45.760> one<00:05:45.910> of<00:05:46.000> the

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
some huge accomplishments one of the

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.940 
some huge accomplishments one of the
probably<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.539> most<00:05:46.630> famous<00:05:47.110> being<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:47.440> they

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
probably the most famous being the they

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.560 
probably the most famous being the they
were<00:05:48.010> involved<00:05:48.400> in<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.760> uncovering<00:05:49.300> of<00:05:49.539> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
were involved in the uncovering of the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.710 
were involved in the uncovering of the
Benedict<00:05:50.050> Arnold<00:05:50.410> plot<00:05:50.740> which<00:05:51.039> in<00:05:51.970> theory<00:05:52.300> had

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
Benedict Arnold plot which in theory had

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.810 
Benedict Arnold plot which in theory had
that<00:05:52.930> not<00:05:53.200> come<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.800> light<00:05:53.979> and<00:05:54.220> had<00:05:54.370> that<00:05:54.580> gone

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
that not come to light and had that gone

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.620 
that not come to light and had that gone
according<00:05:55.419> to<00:05:55.600> their<00:05:56.169> plan<00:05:56.950> it<00:05:57.340> it's<00:05:57.820> very

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
according to their plan it it's very

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.540 
according to their plan it it's very
likely<00:05:58.930> that<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.500> course<00:05:59.919> of<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.220> war<00:06:00.340> would

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
likely that the course of the war would

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.070 
likely that the course of the war would
have<00:06:00.580> gone<00:06:00.789> into<00:06:01.060> foot<00:06:01.300> direction<00:06:01.780> so<00:06:01.930> that

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
have gone into foot direction so that

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.379 
have gone into foot direction so that
among<00:06:02.440> other<00:06:02.650> things<00:06:03.039> you<00:06:03.700> know<00:06:03.789> they<00:06:03.910> heavily

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
among other things you know they heavily

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.810 
among other things you know they heavily
contributed<00:06:04.780> to<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.590> Continental<00:06:06.190> cause<00:06:06.430> and

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
contributed to the Continental cause and

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.090 
contributed to the Continental cause and
and<00:06:07.000> arguably<00:06:07.720> changed<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.710> course<00:06:08.919> of

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
and arguably changed the course of

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:17.519 
and arguably changed the course of
history

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529
