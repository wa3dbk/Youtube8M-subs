to take a look at the V's inside the box

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.599 
to take a look at the V's inside the box
here<00:00:58.250> it's<00:00:59.250> given<00:00:59.609> over<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.780> inch<00:01:01.170> space<00:01:02.039> so

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
here it's given over a two inch space so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.990 
here it's given over a two inch space so
we'll<00:01:02.820> count<00:01:03.090> how<00:01:03.270> many<00:01:03.329> V's<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:04.290> two<00:01:05.070> three

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
we'll count how many V's one two three

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.090 
we'll count how many V's one two three
four<00:01:06.990> five<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.850> half<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.409> five<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
a half stitches in two inches so that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.910 
a half stitches in two inches so that
means<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.979> will<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:18.020> 2.75<00:01:19.020> stitches
