generator it's actually pretty cool I
don't<00:00:10.620> call<00:00:10.800> generator<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:12.210> um<00:00:14.000> mario<00:00:15.000> kart

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240

wii and you can make your own code but
your<00:00:17.490> own<00:00:17.609> button<00:00:17.940> activators<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
your own button activators and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.070 
your own button activators and
unfortunately<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.400> no<00:00:20.609> ntsc-j<00:00:21.480> piece

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

guess i'll make another video for the
three<00:00:43.290> RBIs<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.280> let's<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.149> item<00:00:45.570> code

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
three RBIs but let's just do item code

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.810 
three RBIs but let's just do item code
so<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.660> choose<00:00:49.219> which<00:00:50.219> um

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.520 

which<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.300> one's<00:00:54.570> gamecube<00:00:55.140> controller

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
which one this one's gamecube controller

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.520 
which one this one's gamecube controller
on<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.829> left<00:00:56.190> top<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> right<00:00:58.170> top

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
on the left top now on the right top

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
on the left top now on the right top
it's<00:00:58.890> classic<00:00:59.520> controller<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it's classic controller then on the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.959 
it's classic controller then on the
bottom<00:01:01.199> its<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.680> wheel<00:01:01.859> /<00:01:02.219> wheel<00:01:02.579> mount<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
bottom its we wheel / wheel mount and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
bottom its we wheel / wheel mount and
nunchuck<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.750> switch<00:01:03.989> between<00:01:04.350> those

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
nunchuck so you can switch between those

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.490 
nunchuck so you can switch between those
only<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.400> okay<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.420> i'll<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
only get there okay so i'll do that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.300 
only get there okay so i'll do that
because<00:01:07.799> i'll<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> ninja<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:10.310> see

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
because i'll use a ninja so you can see

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
because i'll use a ninja so you can see
this<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> says<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.390> nunchuck<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.619> if

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this it says we will not nunchuck so if

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.390 
this it says we will not nunchuck so if
you<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.549> click<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.860> got<00:01:17.130> too

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
i'll click fit

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.090 
i'll click fit
one<00:02:15.390> click<00:02:15.720> yes<00:02:16.940> done<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.300> now<00:02:18.650> ok<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.830> then

so you would go back here to your thing
just<00:02:25.380> type<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.100> code<00:02:27.380> then<00:02:28.380> it'll<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.680> at<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
just type in code then it'll be at the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.870 
just type in code then it'll be at the
top<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.050> then<00:02:31.050> here<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.709> see<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.820> is

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
then paste it into code manager ok so

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.680 
then paste it into code manager ok so
you<00:03:18.780> would<00:03:19.019> put<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.470> RM<00:03:20.250> CEO<00:03:20.700> 1<00:03:21.090> choose<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> game

still name ID then you just done it on
and<00:03:41.000> just<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.120> code<00:03:42.299> name<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> does<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.170> be

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
and just a code name it does it can be

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.830 
and just a code name it does it can be
anything<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.769> think<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.860> should<00:03:47.040> name<00:03:47.190> it
