 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.990
 shoot on a regular phone 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.240
 meaning do not issue not waterproof 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 like taking it off under water for that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.260
 we need the bank phone itself 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 two-liter or three liter 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.039
 towel maybe another towel and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.119
 the cover is such a plastic cover which 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 norman hermetically closes you ask 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 he even yes why should he be paid to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 wipe the phone after he took off 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.579
 there is no water for it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 towel on need to shove it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.280
 the jar and the phone to lie tightly to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.410
 extreme banks and well if you shot a video 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.800
 to shove this towel jar with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:53.879
 return it as tight as possible spinning 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 so twisted diagonally to the bottom 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.840
 was smaller and shove them like one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.360

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.360

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 2 towels we have so little 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.360
 quite normal now the most important 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.520
 turn on the phone to record video later 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.450
 you mount course you turn 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.880
 camera jars and shove it against the wall of this 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:46.070
 most banks so that the phone 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.890
 close to the edge of the can 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.229
 all airtight lid 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.860
