00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.410 

today<00:00:11.219> we're<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.940> be<00:00:12.059> talking<00:00:12.269> about

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.509 
today we're going to be talking about
lightning<00:00:13.110> protection<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.830> then<00:00:14.369> we're

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
lightning protection and then we're

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.939 
lightning protection and then we're
going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> go<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.269> search<00:00:15.599> protection<00:00:16.320> now

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
going to go on to search protection now

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.830 
going to go on to search protection now
obviously<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> model<00:00:18.540> of<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.689> building

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
obviously this is a model of a building

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
obviously this is a model of a building
but<00:00:19.169> is<00:00:19.290> our<00:00:19.439> building<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.700> that<00:00:20.849> thing

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
but is our building here and that thing

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.120 
but is our building here and that thing
of<00:00:21.180> course<00:00:21.360> we've<00:00:21.599> got<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.930> roof<00:00:22.110> up<00:00:22.860> here

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
of course we've got the roof up here

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.620 
of course we've got the roof up here
we've<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.520> roof<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.419> roof

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
we've got the roof and on the roof

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.870 
we've got the roof and on the roof
you're<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.259> have<00:00:25.410> these<00:00:25.650> which<00:00:26.429> are<00:00:26.609> called

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you're gonna have these which are called

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.359 
you're gonna have these which are called
air<00:00:27.179> terminations<00:00:27.980> lightning<00:00:28.980> catches

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
air terminations lightning catches

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.999 
air terminations lightning catches
lightning<00:00:29.730> catches<00:00:30.150> there's<00:00:31.009> aluminium

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
lightning catches there's aluminium

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.659 
lightning catches there's aluminium
terminals

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
terminals

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.259 
terminals
there's<00:00:33.600> also<00:00:34.019> copper<00:00:34.920> equivalents<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.059> these

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
there's also copper equivalents so these

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.210 
there's also copper equivalents so these
lightning<00:00:36.839> conductors<00:00:37.379> obviously<00:00:37.710> run<00:00:37.980> down

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
lightning conductors obviously run down

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.310 
lightning conductors obviously run down
the<00:00:38.430> building<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.269> can<00:00:39.510> finish<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.900> in<00:00:40.080> earth

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the building they can finish up in earth

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.259 
the building they can finish up in earth
pictures<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.519> I<00:00:41.699> can<00:00:42.120> also

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
pictures you can see here I can also

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.389 
pictures you can see here I can also

finished up connect you to the main
earth<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.000> terminal<00:00:45.450> obviously<00:00:46.230> you've<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
earth in terminal obviously you've got a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
earth in terminal obviously you've got a
colder<00:00:47.070> night<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> taped<00:00:47.670> gonna<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
colder night the taped gonna be on the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
colder night the taped gonna be on the
outside<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> building<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.829> any

electrics<00:00:50.640> inside<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> building<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> may

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
electrics inside the building as you may

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
electrics inside the building as you may
get<00:00:52.829> an<00:00:52.890> induced<00:00:53.250> voltage<00:00:53.489> into<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> building

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
get an induced voltage into the building

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.439 
get an induced voltage into the building
if<00:00:55.199> there's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> lightning<00:00:55.980> strike<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.940> Darren

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
if there's a lightning strike now Darren

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
if there's a lightning strike now Darren
what<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> lightning<00:00:59.100> protection

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
what do we need a lightning protection

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.029 
what do we need a lightning protection
system<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.120> building<00:01:00.449> large<00:01:01.260> buildings<00:01:01.829> or

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
system and a building large buildings or

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
system and a building large buildings or
buildings<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.760> essential<00:01:03.269> services<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> them

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
buildings are essential services in them

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.779 
buildings are essential services in them
hospitals<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.309> working<00:01:05.580> on

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
hospitals or something that's working on

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.120 
hospitals or something that's working on
a<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.289> precise<00:01:07.289> piece<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> equipment

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
a really precise piece of equipment

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.249 
a really precise piece of equipment
requires<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> lightning<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.899> was<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
requires the lightning if it was to be

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.749 
requires the lightning if it was to be
struck<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> run<00:01:10.890> across<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.280> outside<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
struck to run across the outside of the

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.820 
struck to run across the outside of the
building<00:01:11.910> not<00:01:12.420> through<00:01:12.660> it<00:01:12.690> damaging<00:01:13.619> some<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
building not through it damaging some of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.160 
building not through it damaging some of
the<00:01:13.890> processes<00:01:14.460> inside<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> finish<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the processes inside but to finish the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
the processes inside but to finish the
whole<00:01:16.350> system<00:01:16.710> off<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.369> need<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.670> at

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
whole system off we need to look at

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
whole system off we need to look at
surge<00:01:18.030> protection<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.380> off<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.590> go

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
surge protection so off we go

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
surge protection so off we go
yeah<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.900> lightning<00:01:22.290> strike<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.619> strikes

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
yeah the lightning strike that strikes

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.679 
yeah the lightning strike that strikes
the<00:01:23.009> outside<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> building<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the outside of the building some of that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.969 
the outside of the building some of that
lightning<00:01:24.960> we're<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> earth<00:01:25.650> Tony

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
lightning we're going to the earth Tony

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
lightning we're going to the earth Tony
other<00:01:26.780> parts<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.110> trying<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> back

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
other parts of it was trying it back

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.140 
other parts of it was trying it back
into<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> building<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.729> ever<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
into the building so ever going to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
into the building so ever going to
protect<00:01:30.479> against<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.990> well<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.680> are

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
protect against there well here we are

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
protect against there well here we are
this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.520> we've<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this is what we've got here we can see a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.780 
this is what we've got here we can see a
class-one<00:01:34.740> device<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> origin<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> the

here Darren what class is this this will

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
here Darren what class is this this will
be<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.640> distribution<00:01:41.970> boards<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.750> around

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
be on distribution boards that be around

be on distribution boards that be around
the<00:01:43.290> installation<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.189> we're<00:01:44.280> getting

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the installation so we're getting

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.639 
the installation so we're getting
further<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> installation<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
further into the installation this is a
