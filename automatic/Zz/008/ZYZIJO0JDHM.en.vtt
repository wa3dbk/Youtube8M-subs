few nice goals in fact forget up up

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
few nice goals in fact forget up up
against<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.700> guy<00:01:05.939> didn't<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
against this guy didn't really see that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.820 
against this guy didn't really see that
team<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.200> he's<00:01:07.530> connection<00:01:08.250> went<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.119> believe

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
team but he's connection went I believe

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
team but he's connection went I believe
here<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.229> really<00:01:13.229> laggy

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
here it was really really really laggy

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.760 
here it was really really really laggy
this<00:01:14.220> game<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:16.020> he<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.409> eventually

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this game so I think he just eventually

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
this game so I think he just eventually
just<00:01:17.159> timed<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.180> sure<00:01:18.240> why<00:01:18.630> I'm

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
just timed out I'm not sure why I'm

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.120 
just timed out I'm not sure why I'm
sharing<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> whole<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.710> probably<00:01:20.070> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
sharing the whole thing probably just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.899 
sharing the whole thing probably just
showed<00:01:20.700> him<00:01:21.570> timing<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.700> think

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
showed him timing out here which I think

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
showed him timing out here which I think
he<00:01:24.030> does<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.200> annoying<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
he does it's kind of annoying when that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
he does it's kind of annoying when that
happens<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> lose<00:01:27.090> contracts<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
happens because you lose contracts and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
happens because you lose contracts and
you<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.860> free<00:01:29.070> engine<00:01:29.220> 30<00:01:29.670> coins<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you get free engine 30 coins there

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
you get free engine 30 coins there
because<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> wasn't<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:30.869> been<00:01:31.110> one<00:01:31.350> chance

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
because it wasn't only been one chance

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
because it wasn't only been one chance
the<00:01:31.860> whole<00:01:31.979> game<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.390> people

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the whole game I really think people

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.660 
the whole game I really think people
need<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> sort<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:35.280> there's<00:01:35.549> been

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
need to sort that out go there's been

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
need to sort that out go there's been
