mhm<00:02:04.229> oh<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> guess<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.429> would<00:02:05.520> mean<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.789> far

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
mhm oh so I guess that would mean as far

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.599 
mhm oh so I guess that would mean as far
as<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.240> metal<00:02:07.220> obviously

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:08.609 
as in the metal obviously

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.630 
as in the metal obviously
moderate<00:02:09.119> mm-hmm<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.380> what<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.769> aim<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.070> is<00:02:11.519> we

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
moderate mm-hmm so what we aim for is we

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
moderate mm-hmm so what we aim for is we
want<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:12.900> comfortable<00:02:13.200> as

okay the other treatment options that I
talked<00:04:55.870> about<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.550> first<00:04:57.550> one<00:04:57.729> is<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:58.030> patient

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
talked about and first one is a patient

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.840 
talked about and first one is a patient
controlled<00:04:58.810> analgesia<00:04:59.350> or<00:04:59.770> PCA<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.760> way

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
controlled analgesia or PCA is the way

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.120 
controlled analgesia or PCA is the way
that<00:05:01.030> people<00:05:01.300> refer<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.289> it<00:05:02.560> might

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
that people refer to it it might

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.710 
that people refer to it it might
something<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.730> might<00:05:03.880> have<00:05:04.090> started<00:05:04.360> if

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
something that you might have started if

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.630 
something that you might have started if
you<00:05:04.840> have<00:05:04.990> an<00:05:05.110> operation<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:05.800> might<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.520> it

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
you have an operation you might have it

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.300 
you have an operation you might have it
even<00:05:06.850> if<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.000> don't<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.390> an<00:05:07.540> operation<00:05:08.130> okay

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
even if you don't have an operation okay

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.640 
even if you don't have an operation okay
so<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.790> way<00:05:09.940> that<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.480> pump<00:05:11.080> works<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.470> this

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
so the way that the pump works is this

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.150 
so the way that the pump works is this
is<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.860> computer<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.720> allows<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.320> push

is a computer and it allows you to push

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.770 
is a computer and it allows you to push
a<00:05:15.190> button<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.730> when<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.390> push<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.750> button

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
okay one of the safety features with the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.530 
okay one of the safety features with the
pump<00:05:20.650> though<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.490> only<00:05:21.610> lets<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.060> get<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
pump though is it only lets you get the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.110 
pump though is it only lets you get the
medication<00:05:23.110> once<00:05:23.500> every<00:05:23.830> five<00:05:24.040> minutes<00:05:24.280> okay

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
medication once every five minutes okay

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600 
medication once every five minutes okay
okay<00:05:25.330> so<00:05:26.140> when<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.530> push<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.950> you'll<00:05:27.190> get<00:05:27.370> a
