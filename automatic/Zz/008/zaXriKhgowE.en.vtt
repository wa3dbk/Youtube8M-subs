00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
can see it's pretty reflective as far as

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.370 
can see it's pretty reflective as far as
the<00:05:53.400> finish<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:53.820> concerned

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
the finish is concerned

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.230 
the finish is concerned
looking<00:05:55.380> at<00:05:55.470> a<00:05:55.530> closer<00:05:55.800> look<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.850> can<00:05:56.910> see

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
looking at a closer look you can see

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.840 
looking at a closer look you can see
that<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:58.440> finish<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:59.310> kind<00:05:59.640> of<00:05:59.700> like<00:05:59.820> a

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
that the finish is kind of like a

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.900 
that the finish is kind of like a
metallic<00:06:00.270> black<00:06:00.750> or<00:06:01.280> I'm<00:06:02.280> not<00:06:02.460> sure<00:06:02.610> what<00:06:02.730> kind

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
metallic black or I'm not sure what kind

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.580 
metallic black or I'm not sure what kind
of<00:06:02.970> color<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.420> is<00:06:03.510> but<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.900> is<00:06:04.020> pretty<00:06:04.230> pleasing

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
of color it is but it is pretty pleasing

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.340 
of color it is but it is pretty pleasing
to<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:04.980> eye<00:06:05.010> I'd<00:06:05.310> say<00:06:05.630> it<00:06:06.630> this<00:06:06.810> only<00:06:07.050> does

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.850 
to the eye I'd say it this only does
have<00:06:07.620> 2<00:06:07.920> gigabytes<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:09.050> included<00:06:10.050> memory<00:06:10.470> or
