and<00:03:11.860> what<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:13.069> see<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:14.260> needle<00:03:15.260> is

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
and what we see is that needle is

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.759 
and what we see is that needle is
entering<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.069> settle<00:03:16.989> it's<00:03:17.989> slowing<00:03:18.409> the

give<00:03:29.239> us<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:30.049> possibility<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:31.299> eliminate<00:03:32.299> all

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569

because of this it is very easy to

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.229 
because of this it is very easy to
change<00:03:42.139> over<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.010> stitch<00:03:43.340> from<00:03:43.609> normal<00:03:44.000> fits

the<00:03:53.480> type<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.750> stitch<00:03:54.290> by<00:03:56.290> pushing<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.590> button

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the type of stitch by pushing the button

normal stitch combined take a stitch

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.159 
normal stitch combined take a stitch
even<00:04:02.709> we<00:04:03.709> can<00:04:03.919> run<00:04:04.190> without<00:04:05.030> blind<00:04:05.780> stitch

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
even we can run without blind stitch

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.009 
even we can run without blind stitch
it's<00:04:07.010> possible<00:04:07.639> because<00:04:08.060> we<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.569> thread

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
it's possible because we have thread

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.199 
it's possible because we have thread
welding<00:04:09.560> at<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:10.010> end<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.459> book<00:04:10.639> block<00:04:10.910> and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
we can run without blind stitch which is

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.770 
we can run without blind stitch which is
more<00:04:24.770> effective<00:04:25.520> because<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.479> are<00:04:26.599> not

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
more effective because we are not

which the Ventura MC and what we see is

a very nice and tight book block at the

welding<00:04:49.610> on<00:04:49.789> and<00:04:50.120> that's<00:04:50.539> why<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.860> knot<00:04:52.220> is

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
welding on and that's why the knot is
