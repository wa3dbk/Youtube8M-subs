see<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> Minecraft<00:00:48.810> because<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.320> least

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
see this in Minecraft because at least

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.870 
see this in Minecraft because at least
we<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> chance<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.370> flying

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
we have a chance of flying

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.670 
we have a chance of flying
if<00:00:51.060> course<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.200> tame<00:00:52.560> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
if course we can actually tame it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.979 
if course we can actually tame it
because<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.790> know<00:00:53.850> why<00:00:53.970> just<00:00:54.660> run<00:00:54.840> out<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
because I don't know why just run out I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.780 
because I don't know why just run out I
think<00:00:55.170> about<00:00:55.410> red<00:00:55.650> dragon<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.250> Minecraft

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
think about red dragon in Minecraft

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.069 
think about red dragon in Minecraft
because<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.390> an<00:00:57.480> ender<00:00:57.690> dragon

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because you really have an ender dragon

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.870 
because you really have an ender dragon
then<00:00:58.560> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:58.860> he's<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.550> tingle<00:00:59.820> but

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
then I think he's going to be tingle but

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.479 
then I think he's going to be tingle but
anyway<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.810> back<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.140> 2011<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:02.190> Japan

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
anyway let's go back to 2011 where Japan

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.009 
anyway let's go back to 2011 where Japan
much<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:03.060> of<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.390> starts<00:01:03.750> thinking

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
much kind of you know starts thinking

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.840 
much kind of you know starts thinking
about<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> whole<00:01:04.530> idea<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.860> adding<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.370> dragon

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
about the whole idea of adding a dragon

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
about the whole idea of adding a dragon
into<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.300> game<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.750> suddenly<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
into the game and then suddenly and it

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.840 
into the game and then suddenly and it
was<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> red<00:01:07.979> dragon<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.550> like<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
was the red dragon that was like the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.820 
was the red dragon that was like the
first<00:01:08.990> thought<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.110> had<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.470> dragon

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
first thought they had about dragon

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.100 
first thought they had about dragon
having<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> red<00:01:11.370> dragon<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.850> Minecraft<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.510> not

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
having a red dragon in Minecraft and not

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
having a red dragon in Minecraft and not
sure<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.320> said<00:01:13.650> yeah<00:01:13.800> if<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.040> gonna

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
sure actually said yeah if we're gonna

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.560 
sure actually said yeah if we're gonna
have<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> dragon<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.940> got<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.270> red<00:01:15.450> because

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
have a dragon it's got to be red because

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
have a dragon it's got to be red because
that's<00:01:15.870> what<00:01:16.170> color<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> dragons<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.310> spice

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that's what color the dragons are spice

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
that's what color the dragons are spice
that's<00:01:17.850> why<00:01:17.940> he<00:01:18.390> camera<00:01:18.659> said<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that's why he camera said it in a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
that's why he camera said it in a
Turkish<00:01:19.350> place<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.760> actually<00:01:20.940> thought

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
Turkish place so they actually thought

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
Turkish place so they actually thought
about<00:01:21.270> adding<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> red<00:01:22.530> dragon<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
about adding you know the red dragon and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
about adding you know the red dragon and
then<00:01:23.010> suddenly<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.970> idea<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.360> completely

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
then suddenly the idea just completely

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.390 
then suddenly the idea just completely
disappeared<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.010> added<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.370> new

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
disappeared and then they added a new

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
dimension which is the end and then they

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.930 
dimension which is the end and then they
brought<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> ender<00:01:29.369> dragon<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
but extremely hard to kill and as well

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.020 
but extremely hard to kill and as well
if<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:38.790> sort<00:01:38.940> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
if you actually like you some sort of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
if you actually like you some sort of
like<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> cheats<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.200> morality<00:01:40.500> for

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like a cheats like to morality for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.010 
like a cheats like to morality for
example<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:42.150> make<00:01:42.299> him<00:01:42.479> extra<00:01:42.690> spawn<00:01:42.900> in

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
example and you make him extra spawn in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
example and you make him extra spawn in
the<00:01:43.110> overworld<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.650> could<00:01:43.830> guys<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.400> how

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the overworld you could guys see how

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
the overworld you could guys see how
much<00:01:44.850> destruction<00:01:45.240> he<00:01:45.540> would<00:01:45.630> actually<00:01:45.900> make

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
much destruction he would actually make

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.600 
much destruction he would actually make
to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> ward<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.520> much

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to the ward you would just pretty much

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.100 
to the ward you would just pretty much
destroy<00:01:47.939> everything<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.390> suppose<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.869> twice

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
destroy everything I suppose in it twice

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080 
destroy everything I suppose in it twice
so<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> why<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.460> tried<00:01:50.760> to<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
so this is why they tried to kind of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.060 
so this is why they tried to kind of
keep<00:01:51.390> him<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:51.659> his<00:01:51.780> own<00:01:51.930> dimension<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.650> end<00:01:52.830> our

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
keep him in his own dimension to end our

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.250 
keep him in his own dimension to end our
spies<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.119> he<00:01:54.570> doesn't<00:01:54.720> actually<00:01:54.930> like

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
spies and and he doesn't actually like

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.870 
spies and and he doesn't actually like
fly<00:01:55.560> through<00:01:55.830> law<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> end<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> he's<00:01:56.640> got

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
fly through law in the end and he's got

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
fly through law in the end and he's got
pretty<00:01:57.150> much<00:01:57.270> an<00:01:57.390> open<00:01:57.509> space<00:01:57.960> around<00:01:58.170> him<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
pretty much an open space around him so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.960 
pretty much an open space around him so
he<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.070> he<00:01:59.250> doesn't<00:01:59.400> actually<00:01:59.700> destroy

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
he would do he doesn't actually destroy

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.760 
he would do he doesn't actually destroy
it<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.180> much<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.290> we've<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.740> seen

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it not much but I think we've all seen

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
it not much but I think we've all seen
in<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.310> red<00:02:02.460> dragon<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.630> no<00:02:03.750> one

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
in the red dragon in the game but no one

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
in the red dragon in the game but no one
actually<00:02:04.020> know<00:02:04.320> where<00:02:04.590> he<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
actually know where he is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
actually know where he is
but<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.820> always<00:02:06.060> seen<00:02:06.360> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.720> actually

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
but we always seen if you actually

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
but we always seen if you actually
killed<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.530> dragon<00:02:07.770> before<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.549> have

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
killed in a dragon before you have

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.789 
killed in a dragon before you have
actually<00:02:09.359> definitely<00:02:09.659> seen<00:02:10.109> their<00:02:10.590> red

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
actually definitely seen their red

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:11.390 
actually definitely seen their red

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the red dragon is still inside the egg

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.750 
the red dragon is still inside the egg
the<00:02:14.079> ender<00:02:14.439> egg<00:02:14.590> after<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.220> actually<00:02:15.459> kill

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
the ender egg after you actually kill

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.270 
the ender egg after you actually kill

the secret lies and actually the egg in

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.800 
the secret lies and actually the egg in
Minecraft<00:02:24.819> Wiki<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.299> actually<00:02:25.450> look<00:02:25.689> at

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
Minecraft Wiki if you actually look at

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.059 
Minecraft Wiki if you actually look at
although<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.319> actually<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:26.739> cool<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
although is actually just cool the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.740 
although is actually just cool the
dragon<00:02:27.400> egg<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.610> doesn't<00:02:27.849> even<00:02:27.909> have<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.390> in

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
dragon egg it doesn't even have the in

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.690 
dragon egg it doesn't even have the in
there<00:02:28.959> before<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.500> Dragons<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.099> I'm<00:02:30.159> just

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
there before the Dragons so I'm just

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.349 
there before the Dragons so I'm just
dragon<00:02:31.090> eggs

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
dragon eggs

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.539 
dragon eggs
so<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:32.140> another<00:02:32.620> clue<00:02:32.950> for<00:02:33.010> us<00:02:33.159> to<00:02:33.370> kind

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
so this is another clue for us to kind

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.250 
so this is another clue for us to kind
of<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:33.849> okay<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.120> dragon<00:02:34.720> egg<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.049> could

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
of think okay so dragon egg that could

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.619 
of think okay so dragon egg that could
be<00:02:35.439> maybe<00:02:35.829> any<00:02:36.220> random<00:02:36.609> dragon<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.299> might<00:02:37.480> have

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
be maybe any random dragon we might have

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.509 
be maybe any random dragon we might have
like<00:02:37.840> different<00:02:38.170> colored<00:02:38.439> dragon<00:02:38.769> there<00:02:38.980> red

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
like different colored dragon there red

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.460 
like different colored dragon there red
the<00:02:39.700> yellow<00:02:39.730> blue<00:02:40.180> etc<00:02:40.359> etc<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.079> you<00:02:41.319> might

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the yellow blue etc etc so you might

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800 
the yellow blue etc etc so you might
have<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> different<00:02:41.970> dragon<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.510> know<00:02:43.599> hatch

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
have a different dragon you know hatch

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.839 
have a different dragon you know hatch
from<00:02:44.109> the<00:02:44.260> egg<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.709> still<00:02:45.459> don't<00:02:45.579> have<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
from the egg and we still don't have a

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.550 
from the egg and we still don't have a
way<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.120> hatching<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.079> is<00:02:47.170> going<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.470> be

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
way of hatching it so it is going to be

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.649

really<00:03:13.989> nice<00:03:14.109> if<00:03:14.409> they<00:03:14.560> could<00:03:14.739> probably<00:03:14.920> add

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
really nice if they could probably add

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.530

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
some sort of dragons that could only

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.689 
some sort of dragons that could only
spawn<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.139> Mission<00:03:17.980> bottoms<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:18.400> it's

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
spawn in Mission bottoms because it's

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.550 
spawn in Mission bottoms because it's
like<00:03:18.819> extremely<00:03:19.329> hard<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.660> find<00:03:19.690> us<00:03:20.019> pause<00:03:20.260> and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
like extremely hard to find us pause and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.720

then<00:03:20.739> when<00:03:20.919> you<00:03:20.980> actually<00:03:21.099> find<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.579> would<00:03:21.669> be

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
then when you actually find it would be

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.400 
then when you actually find it would be
nice<00:03:21.879> if<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.090> could<00:03:22.209> actually<00:03:22.359> tame<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.319> and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410
