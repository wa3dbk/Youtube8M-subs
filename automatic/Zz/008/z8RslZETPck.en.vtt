ones<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.850> very<00:01:17.850> similar<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.530> why

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
ones are very very similar which is why

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.820 
ones are very very similar which is why
I<00:01:19.939> gravitated<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.659> towards<00:01:22.110> trying<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
I gravitated you know towards trying the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.670 
I gravitated you know towards trying the
lash<00:01:23.369> blast<00:01:23.900> because<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.439> similar

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.750 

you<00:01:29.550> can<00:01:29.730> see<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.100 

looking<00:01:34.510> at<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.750> two<00:01:34.990> wands<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.780> width

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
looking at the two wands I the the width

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.790 
looking at the two wands I the the width
of<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.830> last<00:01:39.040> last<00:01:39.730> one<00:01:40.480> right<00:01:40.900> here<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.560> a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
of the last last one right here is a

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.740 
of the last last one right here is a
little<00:01:42.010> bigger<00:01:42.370> than<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:43.480> Max<00:01:43.690> Factor<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
little bigger than the Max Factor and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110 
little bigger than the Max Factor and
the<00:01:46.750> brushes<00:01:47.230> I<00:01:47.440> guess<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.980> left<00:01:48.520> both<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
the brushes I guess I left both of the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.420 
the brushes I guess I left both of the
brushes<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.630> brushes<00:01:49.660> are<00:01:50.140> good<00:01:50.350> at<00:01:51.250> that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
brushes the brushes are good at that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.050 
brushes the brushes are good at that
plastic<00:01:52.230> type<00:01:53.230> of<00:01:53.500> situation<00:01:54.430> like<00:01:54.640> plastic

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
plastic type of situation like plastic

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.390 
plastic type of situation like plastic
sights<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:57.510> as<00:01:58.510> far<00:01:58.810> as<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.170> formula<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.100> would

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
sights and as far as the formula I would

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.500 
sights and as far as the formula I would
have<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.670> say<00:02:00.910> like<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.860> Max<00:02:03.760> Factor<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.480> a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
have to say like the Max Factor is a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.440 
have to say like the Max Factor is a
little<00:02:04.930> bit<00:02:05.230> bit<00:02:05.500> more<00:02:05.740> watery<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.030> stays

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
little bit bit more watery and it stays

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.100 
little bit bit more watery and it stays
watery<00:02:08.020> get<00:02:08.710> any<00:02:09.610> thicker<00:02:10.090> until<00:02:10.450> you've<00:02:10.869> had

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
really weird and it's funny look at the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.820 
really weird and it's funny look at the
brushes<00:03:01.420> they're<00:03:01.690> they're<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.470> similar

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
brushes they're they're just so similar

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.040 
brushes they're they're just so similar
even<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> ends<00:03:04.000> kind<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.450> taper<00:03:04.750> off

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
even like the ends kind of taper off

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.380 
even like the ends kind of taper off
similarly<00:03:05.650> their<00:03:06.130> cover<00:03:06.459> girl<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.180> little

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
similarly their cover girl is a little

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.530 
similarly their cover girl is a little
bit<00:03:07.660> more<00:03:07.840> cheaper<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:09.610> about<00:03:09.820> 8<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.030> 9<00:03:10.180> bucks

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
bit more cheaper like about 8 or 9 bucks

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.920 
bit more cheaper like about 8 or 9 bucks
and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.260> Max<00:03:11.650> Factor's<00:03:12.040> about<00:03:12.310> 12<00:03:12.610> or<00:03:12.760> 13<00:03:12.930> now

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930

the pigments are we blacker income girl
and<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:36.400> am<00:03:36.430> using<00:03:38.280> very<00:03:39.280> good<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
and I am using very good and this is the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.540 
and I am using very good and this is the
non<00:03:41.350> waterproof<00:03:41.709> formula<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:45.190> sees<00:03:45.459> the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
non waterproof formula and it sees the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.770 
non waterproof formula and it sees the
way<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.760> something<00:03:46.060> with<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.209> little<00:03:46.420> stick

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
way of something with a little stick

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.480 
way of something with a little stick
right<00:03:46.810> now<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.400> yeah<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:50.020> this<00:03:50.380> gets<00:03:50.860> thicker

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
right now so yeah so this gets thicker

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.900 
right now so yeah so this gets thicker
but<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:53.440> thickness<00:03:53.709> doesn't<00:03:54.250> bother<00:03:54.370> me<00:03:54.550> so

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
but the thickness doesn't bother me so

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.880 
but the thickness doesn't bother me so
much<00:03:54.970> because<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.600> know<00:03:55.900> how<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.200> manipulate<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
much because I know how to manipulate it

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.940 
much because I know how to manipulate it
and<00:03:57.220> work<00:03:57.459> mark<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.090> since<00:03:59.020> I<00:03:59.170> have<00:03:59.440> been<00:03:59.709> using

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
like the formula or the brush itself

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.440 
like the formula or the brush itself
will<00:04:23.590> just<00:04:23.740> throw<00:04:24.040> my<00:04:24.220> lashes<00:04:24.460> my<00:04:24.850> speak<00:04:25.210> for

cover draw I only curl my lashes and

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.230 
cover draw I only curl my lashes and
then<00:04:37.930> apply<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.680> then<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.580> gets<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.880> very

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
then apply it and then it gets a very

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.900 
then apply it and then it gets a very
nice<00:04:40.780> effect<00:04:41.020> like<00:04:41.470> fan<00:04:41.740> like<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.430> very<00:04:44.910> thick
