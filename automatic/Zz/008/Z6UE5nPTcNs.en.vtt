00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this is part one of a two-part series

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680 
this is part one of a two-part series
all<00:00:17.160> right<00:00:17.460> when<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> first<00:00:18.060> got<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.420> question

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
all right when I first got this question

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.929 
all right when I first got this question
from<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.140> viewer<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:20.010> initial<00:00:20.460> response<00:00:20.580> was

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
from a viewer my initial response was

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.179 
from a viewer my initial response was
well<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.810> most<00:00:21.990> obvious<00:00:22.590> way<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> add<00:00:22.949> color

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
well the most obvious way to add color

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.880 
well the most obvious way to add color
in<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.519> music<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> petals<00:00:24.890> yes

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
in your music is with the petals yes

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.439 
in your music is with the petals yes
there's<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.460> many<00:00:26.580> ways<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.210> can

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
there's so many ways in which you can

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.419 
there's so many ways in which you can
impart<00:00:28.050> color<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> thought<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
impart color so I thought of the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.460 
impart color so I thought of the
impressionist<00:00:30.179> music<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.570> Debussy<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.230> Ravel

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
impressionist music of Debussy and Ravel

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
impressionist music of Debussy and Ravel
and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.460> thought<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.239> potential

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and I thought of all the potential

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.630 
and I thought of all the potential
things<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.230> could<00:00:34.380> show<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
things I could show you but then I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
things I could show you but then I
thought<00:00:35.850> wait<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> minute<00:00:36.630> there<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.350> other

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
thought wait a minute there are other

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
thought wait a minute there are other
ways<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.399> add<00:00:38.520> color<00:00:38.820> aren't<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.079> this

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
ways to add color aren't there so this

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.799 
ways to add color aren't there so this
video<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> explore<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.690> ways

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
video is going to explore all the ways

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
video is going to explore all the ways
you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> add<00:00:43.260> color<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.770> music<00:00:44.070> without

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you can add color to your music without

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.720 
you can add color to your music without
using<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> petals<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.129> second<00:00:47.520> part

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
using the petals at all the second part

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
using the petals at all the second part
is<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> explore<00:00:48.450> how<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:49.289> color<00:00:49.469> you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
is going to explore how your color you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
is going to explore how your color you
visit<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> petals<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.239> chosen<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
visit with the petals so I've chosen a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.209 
visit with the petals so I've chosen a
piece<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.410> play<00:00:52.739> without<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
piece that you can play without the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.880 
piece that you can play without the
petal<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> Mozart<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.870> fact<00:00:55.350> Mozart's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
piano did not have any pedal so it's a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500

to show you several different things you
can<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.330> add<00:01:15.600> color<00:01:16.020> even<00:01:16.830> without<00:01:17.040> using

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
can do to add color even without using

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:44.370 
can do to add color even without using
the<00:01:17.670> pedal

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.930 

all<00:01:45.380> right<00:01:45.650> everything<00:01:46.100> was<00:01:46.220> accurate<00:01:46.700> there

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
all right everything was accurate there

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.570 
all right everything was accurate there
pretty<00:01:47.720> much<00:01:47.960> exactly<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.040> way<00:01:49.160> it's<00:01:49.340> written

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
pretty much exactly the way it's written

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.720 
pretty much exactly the way it's written
but<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.870> little<00:01:51.110> lifeless<00:01:51.560> isn't<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.220> well

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
but it's a little lifeless isn't it well

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.270 
but it's a little lifeless isn't it well
first<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.690> all<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.230> thing<00:01:54.260> that<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.070> do

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
first of all one thing that you can do

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.150 
first of all one thing that you can do
is<00:01:55.730> just<00:01:56.390> simply<00:01:56.720> change<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.770> balance

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
is just simply change the balance

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.130 
is just simply change the balance
between<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.580> hands<00:01:59.150> playing<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.900> melody

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
between the hands playing the melody

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.340 
between the hands playing the melody
stronger<00:02:00.920> than<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> accompaniment

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
stronger than the accompaniment

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.650 
stronger than the accompaniment
immediately<00:02:03.350> has<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:04.010> flavor<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.910> yes<00:02:05.270> color

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
immediately has a flavor and yes color

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.840 
immediately has a flavor and yes color
to<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.960> music<00:02:06.320> I'm<00:02:06.500> going<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.010> only<00:02:07.310> add<00:02:07.820> that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
to the music I'm going to only add that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.320 
to the music I'm going to only add that
one<00:02:08.720> element<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.470> balancing<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.490> hands<00:02:10.970> with

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
one element of balancing the hands with

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:39.280 
one element of balancing the hands with
more<00:02:11.600> weight<00:02:11.960> in<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.740> right<00:02:12.920> hand

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.140 

so<00:02:40.290> already<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.950> can<00:02:41.099> hear<00:02:41.519> it's<00:02:41.790> better

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
so already you can hear it's better

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.000 
so already you can hear it's better
because<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.840> melody<00:02:43.260> comes<00:02:43.469> through<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:43.980> you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
because the melody comes through and you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.619 
because the melody comes through and you
don't<00:02:44.129> hear<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.579> those<00:02:44.819> notes<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.420> left

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
now I know this is a slow progression of

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.150 
now I know this is a slow progression of
adding<00:06:00.390> expressive<00:06:00.990> elements<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:01.560> color<00:06:01.890> to

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
and watch the beginning of this again
