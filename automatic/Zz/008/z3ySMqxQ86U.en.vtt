edition of the always here with me
it's<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> new<00:00:37.500> shape<00:00:37.830> that<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.580> present<00:00:39.060> in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it's a new shape that we present in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.170 
it's a new shape that we present in
three<00:00:39.570> new<00:00:40.020> sizes<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:41.160> other<00:00:41.340> size<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:42.000> keep

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
three new sizes the other size we keep

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.200 
three new sizes the other size we keep
the<00:00:42.330> same<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.960> new<00:00:43.140> 8<00:00:43.410> 11<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.160> 9<00:00:44.670> 1<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the same we have a new 8 11 and 9 1 and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.979 
the same we have a new 8 11 and 9 1 and
a<00:00:45.450> 9<00:00:45.690> 3<00:00:46.520> what<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> changes<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.510> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
a 9 3 what are the changes from that so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
a 9 3 what are the changes from that so
successful<00:00:49.680> always<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> look<00:00:50.790> at<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
successful always if you look at the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.390 
successful always if you look at the
nose<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.630> boat<00:00:51.780> you'll<00:00:52.050> quickly<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.770> we

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
nose of the boat you'll quickly see we

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.280 
nose of the boat you'll quickly see we
pinched<00:00:53.790> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> nose<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.450> bit<00:00:54.720> just

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
pinched in the nose a little bit just

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.810 
pinched in the nose a little bit just
makes<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.890> easier<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.460> you're

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
makes a little easier when you're

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.040 
makes a little easier when you're
turning<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> board<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> way<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
turning the board on the way if you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
turning the board on the way if you
don't<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.650> much<00:00:58.920> volume<00:00:59.220> and<00:00:59.580> weight<00:00:59.760> up

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
don't have as much volume and weight up

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
don't have as much volume and weight up
the<00:01:00.690> front<00:01:03.199> we<00:01:04.199> pull<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> rails<00:01:04.860> down<00:01:05.160> quite<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the front we pull the rails down quite a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.420 
the front we pull the rails down quite a
bit<00:01:05.960> which<00:01:06.960> also<00:01:07.260> makes<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> easier<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.190> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
bit which also makes it easier on the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
bit which also makes it easier on the
way<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> main<00:01:09.360> target<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.230> all

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
way if that was the main target the all

wave<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> reputation<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.760> catch<00:01:12.000> waves

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
wave has the reputation to catch waves

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
wave has the reputation to catch waves
easy<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.860> kept<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> shape

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
easy this is what we kept in the shape

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
easy this is what we kept in the shape
so<00:01:14.940> we<00:01:15.060> didn't<00:01:15.300> really<00:01:15.510> mess<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.960> Scoob

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so we didn't really mess with the Scoob

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.740 
so we didn't really mess with the Scoob
rocker<00:01:16.500> line<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.640> bottom<00:01:17.940> shape<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
rocker line or the bottom shape it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.920 
rocker line or the bottom shape it
features<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> single<00:01:19.740> concave<00:01:19.950> entry<00:01:20.930> going

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
features the single concave entry going

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.550 
features the single concave entry going
into<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> double<00:01:23.159> concave<00:01:23.400> v<00:01:23.850> mid<00:01:24.120> section

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
into a double concave v mid section

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.010 
into a double concave v mid section
releasing<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.040> way<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.000> tail<00:01:27.240> quite

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
releasing all the way to the tail quite

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
releasing all the way to the tail quite
a<00:01:28.050> bit<00:01:28.260> of<00:01:29.120> tail<00:01:30.120> kick<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> rocker

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
a bit of tail kick and the rocker

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
a bit of tail kick and the rocker
actually<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> sure<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.610> turn

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
actually to be sure that you can turn

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.270 
actually to be sure that you can turn
this<00:01:33.060> board<00:01:33.360> still<00:01:33.990> quite<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> big<00:01:34.590> board<00:01:34.860> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
this board still quite a big board so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.499 
this board still quite a big board so
you<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> make<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.240> enough

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you want to make sure you have enough

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
you want to make sure you have enough
curve<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> back<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.729> step<00:01:39.119> back

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
curve in the back so you can step back

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
curve in the back so you can step back
on<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.049> turn<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> along<00:01:40.649> comes<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
on it to turn it along comes as a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.139 
on it to turn it along comes as a
thruster<00:01:42.210> set<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.710> us<00:01:43.710> center<00:01:44.100> fin

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
thruster set up us center fin

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.980 
thruster set up us center fin
and<00:01:47.399> these<00:01:48.399> small<00:01:48.759> changes<00:01:49.060> made<00:01:49.450> quite<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.750> big

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
and these small changes made quite a big

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.980 
and these small changes made quite a big
change<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.619> tape<00:01:50.920> we<00:01:51.700> kept<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.509> outline

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
change to the tape we kept the outline

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.880 
change to the tape we kept the outline
fairly<00:01:53.560> parallel<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:56.079> board<00:01:56.350> doesn't<00:01:56.619> go

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
fairly parallel so the board doesn't go

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.440 
fairly parallel so the board doesn't go
left<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.399> right<00:01:57.490> when<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.000> want<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.270> catch

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
left and right when you want to catch

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.419 
left and right when you want to catch
the<00:01:58.659> wave<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.350> especially<00:01:59.740> important

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
the wave this is especially important

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.740 
the wave this is especially important
when<00:02:00.460> you're<00:02:00.700> new<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.179> spot<00:02:01.450> when<00:02:01.630> you're

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
when you're new to the spot when you're

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.749 
when you're new to the spot when you're
catching<00:02:01.960> your<00:02:02.289> first<00:02:02.560> waves<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.369> want<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.640> be

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
catching your first waves you want to be

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.389 
catching your first waves you want to be
sure<00:02:03.969> your<00:02:04.149> board<00:02:04.420> goes<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.990> nice<00:02:05.469> flow

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
sure your board goes a nice flow

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.719 
sure your board goes a nice flow
straight<00:02:07.360> line<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:08.200> catch<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.649> wave<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.489> deck

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
straight line to catch the wave the deck

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.080 
straight line to catch the wave the deck
completely<00:02:10.299> flat<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.280> way<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.910> rail

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
completely flat all the way to the rail

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.089 
completely flat all the way to the rail
this<00:02:13.360> gives<00:02:13.629> a<00:02:13.720> lot<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.900> stability<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.920> can

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
this gives a lot of stability we can

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.949 
this gives a lot of stability we can
also<00:02:15.280> hide<00:02:15.580> quite<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> bit<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.239> volume<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.780> there

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
also hide quite a bit of volume in there

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.110 
also hide quite a bit of volume in there
which<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.290> nice<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.250> ball<00:02:18.430> will<00:02:18.670> float<00:02:18.940> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
which is nice so the ball will float you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.100 
which is nice so the ball will float you
nicely<00:02:20.099> as<00:02:21.099> all<00:02:22.030> our<00:02:22.180> board<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.930> have<00:02:23.079> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
nicely as all our board we have the
