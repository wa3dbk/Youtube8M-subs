over 10 million in fact that Winchester
has<00:00:32.419> taken<00:00:32.960> notice<00:00:33.379> now<00:00:33.800> they<00:00:33.980> put<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.280> ton<00:00:34.760> of

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
has taken notice now they put a ton of

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.030 
has taken notice now they put a ton of
research<00:00:35.330> and<00:00:35.540> development<00:00:35.629> into<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.710> best

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
research and development into the best

research and development into the best
and<00:00:37.370> most<00:00:37.580> effective<00:00:38.030> ways<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.900> take<00:00:39.170> down<00:00:39.199> a

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
and most effective ways to take down a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.920 
and most effective ways to take down a
deer<00:00:39.920> now<00:00:40.399> this<00:00:40.610> new<00:00:40.820> round<00:00:41.090> has<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.420> ton<00:00:41.899> of

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
deer now this new round has a ton of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.510 
deer now this new round has a ton of
great<00:00:42.230> attributes<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:43.220> have<00:00:43.340> been

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
great attributes that have been

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.850 
great attributes that have been
carefully<00:00:44.090> designed<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.930> up<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.649> first

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
carefully designed to that up the first

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.170 
carefully designed to that up the first
thing<00:00:46.100> you'll<00:00:46.309> notice<00:00:46.610> well<00:00:46.969> they've

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
thing you'll notice well they've

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.020 
thing you'll notice well they've
redesigned<00:00:47.660> a<00:00:48.110> really<00:00:48.710> large<00:00:49.040> polymer<00:00:49.760> tip

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
redesigned a really large polymer tip

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.690 
redesigned a really large polymer tip
now<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.719> allows<00:00:51.079> for<00:00:51.190> extremely<00:00:52.190> rapid

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
now this allows for extremely rapid

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.270 
now this allows for extremely rapid
expansion<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.809> produces<00:00:54.440> larger<00:00:55.010> wound

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
expansion that produces larger wound

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.979 
expansion that produces larger wound
channels<00:00:55.700> yet<00:00:56.149> it<00:00:56.390> still<00:00:56.690> has<00:00:56.960> enough

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
channels yet it still has enough

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.500 
channels yet it still has enough
toughness<00:00:57.770> in<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.040> jacket<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:58.670> weight<00:00:59.300> to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
toughness in the jacket and weight to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.240 
toughness in the jacket and weight to
penetrate<00:01:00.079> all<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.320> way<00:01:00.559> through<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.039> deer

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
penetrate all the way through the deer

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.100 
penetrate all the way through the deer
the<00:01:01.789> reason<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:02.239> works<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.899> tip

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
the reason this works is the tip

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.200 
the reason this works is the tip
actually<00:01:03.680> extends<00:01:04.160> further<00:01:04.550> back<00:01:04.820> into<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
actually extends further back into the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.719 
actually extends further back into the
bullet<00:01:05.509> creating<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:06.200> wider<00:01:06.619> front<00:01:07.100> portion<00:01:07.490> of

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
bullet creating a wider front portion of

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.999 
bullet creating a wider front portion of
the<00:01:07.850> bullet<00:01:08.119> itself<00:01:08.240> causing<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.320> more<00:01:09.500> rapid

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
the bullet itself causing a more rapid

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.520 
the bullet itself causing a more rapid
expansion<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.789> giving<00:01:11.600> greater<00:01:12.050> trauma

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
expansion and giving greater trauma

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.559 
expansion and giving greater trauma
during<00:01:12.800> that<00:01:13.100> first<00:01:13.369> five<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.970> six<00:01:14.179> inches<00:01:14.330> of

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
during that first five to six inches of

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.690 
during that first five to six inches of
penetration<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.830> you're<00:01:16.100> going<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.310> be<00:01:16.399> taking

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
penetration so you're going to be taking

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.210 
penetration so you're going to be taking
a<00:01:16.789> belongs<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.569> vitals<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:18.170> really<00:01:18.830> works

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
a belongs the vitals it really works

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.070 
a belongs the vitals it really works
great<00:01:19.610> now<00:01:19.819> it's<00:01:20.179> pretty<00:01:20.390> simple<00:01:20.810> how<00:01:20.959> it

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
great now it's pretty simple how it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.469 
great now it's pretty simple how it
works<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.740> reason<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.220> works<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.880> larger<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
works the reason it works the larger the

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.480 
works the reason it works the larger the
diameter<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:24.259> more<00:01:24.470> rapidly<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.190> bullet

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
diameter the more rapidly the bullet

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.059 
diameter the more rapidly the bullet
expands<00:01:26.090> leaving<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.899> higher<00:01:27.289> transfer<00:01:27.920> of

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
expands leaving to a higher transfer of

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.279 
expands leaving to a higher transfer of
energy<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.910> larger<00:01:29.330> wound<00:01:29.569> channel<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.200> if

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
energy in a larger wound channel so if

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.779 
energy in a larger wound channel so if
you<00:01:30.410> think<00:01:30.590> about<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.160> they<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.670> achieved

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
you think about it they have achieved

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.330 
you think about it they have achieved
the<00:01:32.270> perfect<00:01:32.899> balance<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.530> controlled

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
the perfect balance of controlled

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.300 
the perfect balance of controlled
expansion<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.500> penetration<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.709> reason

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
expansion and penetration and the reason

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.130 
expansion and penetration and the reason
it<00:01:37.399> can<00:01:37.429> be<00:01:37.670> accomplished<00:01:38.300> well<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:38.929> is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
it can be accomplished well this is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.919 
it can be accomplished well this is
designed<00:01:39.560> for<00:01:39.740> deer<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.849> deer<00:01:41.060> only<00:01:41.420> for

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
designed for deer and for deer only for
