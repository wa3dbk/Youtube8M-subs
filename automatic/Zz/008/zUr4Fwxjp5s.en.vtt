00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.250
 hey what wave characters like are 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.870
 I hope you are the best on the day of 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.530
 today they equip capture is greeting them 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.879
 in a new chapter of semiology for 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.919
 no you are not true only 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.110
 biology is the third chapter and good 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.309
 If you are new and you are not aware of the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 two other chapters that left the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.200
 seeds one since it is quite possible 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.940
 very famous that is os spies and the other 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.080
 person let's go seed is too much 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.450
 funny that has good potential 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.660
 for survival maps or maps for 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.220
 creative, well, guys, my air is going 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.439
 well, I do not know why but good 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.809
 let's go like this a player for now 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.820
 leave us so much nonsense let's go here 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.199
 I also leave them in the description on 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.850
 video link and well also in 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.219
 annotations around the entire 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 video well guys in word line put you 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.859
 as you want and in this case I will put 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.819
 say number 3 we will change it to 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.409
 creative and that is that we do not have the take 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.329
 we will go here we leave it as it is and 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.210
 here we click where it says 7 for 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.519
 the word generator and we write this 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.319
 seed the number is quite long I 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.870
 It gives laziness to read from the number number and to 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.960
 that makes us obviously then 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.280
 you say long as the video is the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.120
 I leave and written that shortly in the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 description 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.930
 they also copy in an annotation 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.180
 I will also paste the number so that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.070
 you do not miss me and say to 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.940
 twitter I do not see time to copy well there 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.460
 will be 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.290
 we give you two and we click on new world and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.690
 Well guys, I see them as soon as 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.930
 load the world in a little while 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.050
 guachos and in guys we are already in the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.400
 boy is the one who is already in the spa 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.830
 then good what will be the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.330
 little seed I put it in normal so that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.800
 well , give us so much work in that 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.950
 charge because well starting the world 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.460
 and well in as last as well 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.160
 let's change the game mode is that 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.050
 I lost space and well, you have to 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.420
 die to find it again and well 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.160
 guys how can you see is one is a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.840
 forest that starts as a seed 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.940
 communicated to the common and any common 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.200
 and minecraft stream but if 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.650
 we advance we already saw in which direction 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.980
 look from here to here like this 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.020
 note is a a desert village that 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.490
 Well, it's pretty pretty and right now they're going 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.229
 to see why in first then good 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.369
 of the ordinary villagers already 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.349
 you know 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.319
 there are not many trunks is what I tell them 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.049
 in question to the casitas but not in the 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.730
 desert look a certain this is magical 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:24.940
 for me but well the important thing to be 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.730
 here guys that good is in these 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.459

 songs here we have a chest of 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.610
 treasure see how many nice things there 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.550
 that is, it is infinity of an armor of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.380
 gold there are disks there is gunpowder iron 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.000
 that we had, and we have to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.770
 dig in what are mounds of 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.900
 sand that they see on the outside that they are where 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.050

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.500

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.730
 squares no and the thread okay guys this 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.650
 It is one of the small rewards that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.240
 bring this this village because it is 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.270
 if the voter is not living here is 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.140
 where is the beautiful see there are three 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.680
 diamonds about three emerald bones 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.579
 seven gold 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.660
 rotten meat and that is there are 912 other 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.820
 gold 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.320
 well, it 's so nice, do not step on the 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.580
 blue and do not go to write because they are going to 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.500

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.300
 have a party so good guys 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.260
 that's one of the things that are included 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.230
 is that they are very beautiful 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.000
 the pyramid and then how did they see the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.569
 entry is easy can not be entered by 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.549
 him on the other side that is of the 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.769
 spoilers that is around here you can get 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.459
 here and well then here you know it's not what 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.470
 typical to go down to the pyramid also 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.000
 you can download this is very beautiful is 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.190

 Well it's very nice guys and well 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.580
 apart from all the beauty it has is 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.100
 that together with several languages â€‹â€‹that is what 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.329
 is the forest the desert yes or yes of 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.739
 true only in minecraft what 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.590
 find 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.500
 this is towards logic completely and 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.010
 Well, guys, I think I think yesterday 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.840
 is that I think there is a jungle 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.200
 to say it we are also in this all 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.200
 the villagers 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.540
 all right 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.490
 here we can come to steal the 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.110
 crops their women lost women 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.900
 but it did not suit us to steal his women 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.480
 only its cultivation and well guys look 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.130
 here is like an oasis like that full 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.750
 of jungle looks very beautiful seems what 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.390
 you do because then all the desert and it's 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.740
 nothing more a little piece of jungle is very 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.990
 nice for a survival guys 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.880
 for something that you want to do in 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.440
 true he recommended seed so that 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.060

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.070
 will like it and well guys, I will 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.720
 dismissal this chapter was the one of 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.310
 semiology number 3 I recommend that 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.400
 read us two in case they have any 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.110
