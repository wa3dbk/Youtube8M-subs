00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.010
 and now fire friends marketing the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.890
 coal mining today we want to present the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.779
 barbecue friend who is a barbecue of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 interior with which we can cook 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.419
 both within and outside home is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 barbecue works with a special type 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.400
 of coal that is bamboo charcoal that in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 chip form and well a camera 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 that they use about 200 grams per 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 barbecue and you have to use 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 always with this power gel because 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 if no other gender is able to give this 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.769
 kind of clear well in clear we are not going to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 proceed so that we let turn on and 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.400
 then we'll teach it to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 cook some fish skewers in the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.879
 mica 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.799
 well look at this barbecue has what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.860
 first a base so you do not play 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.839
 barbecue that is ceramic but that there 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.650
 what to do is to take practically 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.570
 liter of water on the barbecue 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.870
 to a child the mouth would fall over to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.769
 charcoal and apart makes for you to have weight 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.780
 we are one liter of water 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.940
 we miss him the answer the container 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 about which we are going to cook we are going to 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.660
 put the carbon I'm very simple 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 always like remembering to use 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.810
 bar bistro vergel 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 you have to fill the surface 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 surface with enough gel 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
 this is important is not a barbecue 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 which has a very interesting price 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.220
 arrives 90 euros and then good then the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.800
 Coal and gel if it's a bit more expensive 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.870
 but it's worth it because for a few 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.020
 three euros before making a barbecue 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.450
 inside the house then you have to put the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.520
 part are the ones that we are going to place the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.230
 coal and what is important is not 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.430
 fill the coal barbecue or 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.110
 just about 200 grams because then 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.480
 It has a lot of calorific value if it is not 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.140
 impossible to cook with it you have to take 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.730
 a measure as you see a handful like 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.730
 you see here once we've put the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.250
 coal again sprays again 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.300
 with liquid 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.480
 with the left of meco bar 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.610
 and as simple as the links already long 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.480
 what are we going for 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.480
 we learn 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.320
 and I tell you 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.330
 now not help 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.620
 good friends once we have the mica 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.690
 Well nothing like we can start 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.150
 cook wash mouth mica comes with a 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.830
 iron to move what is the grill 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.050
 every sensitive vessel or if it comes with these 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.280
 with four clamps that are like these 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.140
 van is to go around the food 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.880
 we develop thought is but let's 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.950
 make some skewers that we have bought 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.140
 ready-made that come with tuna salmon 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.140
 and a little bit of cheese directly 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.760
 nothing like navarra acp 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.640
 and we have done first we have done 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.740
 directly on the grill we have 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.110
 done these skewers we're going to 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.000
 do we put this part that is a 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.350
 iron and on the iron what we're going 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.940
 to do is a little bit of pressure 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.940
 erika then 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.760
 we can pour a little oil 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.710
 with this 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.180
 we could do it so directly 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.270
 now we can also see a little thing 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.430
 let's do a few directly 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.600
 on the plate 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.310
 the others we make them remove the 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.550
 grill and we make them directly the 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.550
 grill 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.350
 davies enrique 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.100
 is the only one that comes out that is the one of the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.500
 combustion of food 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.080
 now we place directly on the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.760
 embers on the grill we place them 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.760
 we're going to have two ways 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.230
 my friends 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.990
 the colorcito who has caught and take it out 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.310
 already directly to eat today because 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.860
 We are alone but I am the family 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.570
 more than a week so you know that 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.700
 you can have a barbecue at home that 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.170
 does not make one when turning on the only 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.170
 what it does is like an iron to cook 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.750
 ah
