00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 How about sports friends? 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.549
 here on the Ferris wheel with Alejandro Castro 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.379
 thank you very much alex for receiving us 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.540
 here on the Ferris wheel thank you for 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.559
 come here today alex how has this been 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.330
 holiday stage for you as I say has 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.119
 been very good has served us to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 clear our head a little to 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.609
 reflect I feel certain things and to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.460
 come back with new illusions this this 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.529
 tournament we have as it has been after 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.470
 the final how you have felt like as 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.899
 you saw the team 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.920
 obviously look after the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.920
 match for us 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.079
 it's hard not going to take it or 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.210
 cope with those first days on 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.890
 we always had confidence 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.680
 in getting the result 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 Unfortunately it was not the easiest thing is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.199
 they gave us things in the best way 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.239
 but they are things that happen in football 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.329
 two months before we had to be heroes in 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.339
 the cup final and now we had to be 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.960
 villains then you have to take it with 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:09.100
 certain measure that not certain reserve and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.479
 you learn to deal with all that is not 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 great merit the fact of having reached 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.310
 so many finals is a great job that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.600
 it has been done unfortunately not what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 we were able to finish like us 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 we would like but I think the effort and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.140
 it's there I think we're very close to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.210
 get it today and also you have had 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.520
 two teams in your students career and 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.240
 blue cross but also with students 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.820
 you lived a very difficult time can 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.910
 descend to the first one as was that is 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.119
 that moment then look are very 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.970
 complicated is a great sadness that 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.240
 great disappointment that the one that seizes you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.210
 when when that happened to us and when 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.580
 there is your devotee who even blue if not 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.320
 bad memory you did against pachuca 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.320
 entering by joel huiquí if it is not like that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.350
 correct but what you felt was very 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.240
 nervous 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.970
 I liked a lot of work reviewing 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.120
 the first 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.310
 it was a great joy 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.119
 I played a few minutes but I remember 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.879
 very good 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.760
 I will never forget is like the 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.340
 first step to be here at first and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.280
 very very happy if it had not been 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.909
 footballer that you would have liked to do 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.900
 Well look, I would have liked 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.170
 probably the architect I like 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.190
 much 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.170
 all that but what I like the most is the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 sport then if it had not been 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 footballer would have sought to be a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.060
 tennis player I love tennis 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.610
 I have some years of playing golf and I 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.290
 love then what related to the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.890
 sport is what I'm really passionate about 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.970
 and last week two players 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.220
 his retreats announced two players 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.349
 with which you played the pony ruiz and the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.830
 jimmy lush but who do you think that 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.120
 more need football 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.230
 well look at the pony he gave a lot 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.730
 many things to soccer like 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.220
 jimmy 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.710
 it's a legend it will not play until 40 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.910
 years I believe that very few 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.320
 with jimmy I have a great friendship and I 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.890
 it hurt a lot that he retired 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.220
 I think I was physically still 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.230
 very well and I could still give much more 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.910
 to football but for different 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.010
 circumstances he had to withdraw 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.050
 and well I eat like your friend I can 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.660
 say that it hurts a lot about jaime today 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.960
 we all have an idol since 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.910
 we grow since we are young 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.070
 but who was your idol who was who 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.760
 it inspired you to be able to reach 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.659
 Where are you 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.780
 Well, look, I really have not had a 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:57.030
 specific person I think it has been 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.370
 by stages I remember a lot of jordan 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.230
 although he is not a football manager but I 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.920
 agreement long before he retired 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.200
 I followed him very much 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.140
 I followed a lot to rafa marquez is from 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.330
 atlas and when he went to Monaco I 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.120
 loved playing figo zidane 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.700
 because all of them seeing you motivate you 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.280
 to fight for your dreams I am the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.060
 manager of some team you are going to be 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.380
 the technician 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.200
 then I'm going to give you some 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.930
 players and you for your experiences you 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.490
 the reason in the heart as you want 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.400
 you're going to tell me who would prefer a hundred 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.470
 Team A 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.940
 corona and ochoa 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.340
 crown 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.360
 for technical assistant the 'ojitos' meza 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.550
 a memo vázquez 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.190
 to the two 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.510
 aldo de nigris oribe peralta or raúl 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.009
 jiménez 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.979
 I believe that uribe 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.159
 pablo barrier or javier aquino for a 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.650
 pablo band and for another here does not reign or 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.470
 giovanni dos saints 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:05.800
 lead to a personal question that would be 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.340
 of the current world if in football 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.289
 I think football gives you a lot 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.430
 joy to people and help too 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.590
 take 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.540
 sometimes stress or a lot of 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.820
 adrenaline much passion I think that 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.560
 it would be a world without so much joy 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.720
 many thanks álex that you have very 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.220
 good season and keep going up 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.650
 thank you very much for the interview 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:36.010
 Greetings to all and good we will be there 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.010
 playing to see who wins until then
