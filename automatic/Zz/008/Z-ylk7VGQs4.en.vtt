this<00:00:34.280> my<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.550> impression<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> book

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
this my first impression was the book

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.040 
this my first impression was the book
was<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:38.250> has<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> very<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.360> shiny<00:00:39.719> cover

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
was that it has a very very shiny cover

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
was that it has a very very shiny cover
as<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.670> my

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
as you can see it's like a that's my

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
as you can see it's like a that's my
window<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.860> didn't<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.340> come<00:00:44.489> through

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
window that didn't really come through

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
window that didn't really come through
when<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:46.070> created<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:48.079> genuinely<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
when I created it genuinely from the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.639 
when I created it genuinely from the
outside<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> measurements<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.899> fine<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
outside all the measurements are fine I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.810 
outside all the measurements are fine I
even<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.820> text<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.410> fairly<00:00:56.010> it's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
even the text up there is fairly it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.389 
even the text up there is fairly it's
okay<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.989> mean<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:58.949> too<00:00:59.070> far<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
okay I mean it's it's a bit too far to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.160 
okay I mean it's it's a bit too far to
the<00:00:59.520> top<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.390> center<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.050> my

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the top and the center that's in my

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.420 
the top and the center that's in my
InDesign<00:01:01.559> document<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.250> oh<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.979> first

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
InDesign document but oh well the first

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.060 
InDesign document but oh well the first
impression<00:01:05.970> moving<00:01:06.240> inside<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:11.000> generally

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
impression moving inside it's generally

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.789 
impression moving inside it's generally
kind<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> nice<00:01:14.909> print<00:01:15.530> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> what

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
kind you have a nice print kind of what

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.789 
kind you have a nice print kind of what
you<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.009> expect

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.730 

it's<00:01:20.630> basically<00:01:22.280> laser<00:01:23.280> print<00:01:24.030> quality<00:01:24.740> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it's basically laser print quality that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.370 
it's basically laser print quality that
you<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.520> any<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.360> usual<00:01:28.020> laser

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you will get of any of the usual laser

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.100 
you will get of any of the usual laser
printers<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> would<00:01:29.220> seen<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.689> example<00:01:30.750> in

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
printers you would seen for example in

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.069 
printers you would seen for example in
offices<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.240> paper<00:01:33.450> isn't<00:01:33.720> particularly

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
offices the paper isn't particularly

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.800 
offices the paper isn't particularly
special<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:36.650> smooth<00:01:37.650> laser<00:01:37.920> printer

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
special it's just smooth laser printer

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
special it's just smooth laser printer
stuff<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.740> particularly<00:01:41.340> thick<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.210> it's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
stuff not particularly thick but it's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.859 
stuff not particularly thick but it's
okay<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> doesn't<00:01:43.079> shine<00:01:43.259> through<00:01:44.750> what<00:01:45.750> I'm

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
okay it doesn't shine through what I'm

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.490 
okay it doesn't shine through what I'm
disappointed<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.530> mainly<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> all

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
disappointed about mainly is that on all

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.359 
disappointed about mainly is that on all
the<00:01:49.649> pages<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.970> millimeter

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
the pages there is one millimeter

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.660 
the pages there is one millimeter
off-center<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.299> cut<00:01:54.570> correctly<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
off-center so it's not cut correctly and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
off-center so it's not cut correctly and
some<00:01:56.780> pictures<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:59.600> kind<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.689> misprint<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
some pictures have kind of misprint so

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.639 
some pictures have kind of misprint so
for<00:02:02.219> example<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.719> has<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> little<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
for example this one has a little bit of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.160 
for example this one has a little bit of
RGB<00:02:08.099> happening<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.000> that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

yeah<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> mean<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:18.720> nice<00:02:18.959> pages<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> doesn't

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
yeah so I mean I'm nice pages it doesn't

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.530 
yeah so I mean I'm nice pages it doesn't
really<00:02:20.280> matter<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.910> has<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> whiteboard

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
really matter that that has a whiteboard

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.210 
really matter that that has a whiteboard
on<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.810> top<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.560> example<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.160> one

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
on the top but for example on this one

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.699 
on the top but for example on this one
it's<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.760> yeah<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.050> I'm<00:02:25.110> not<00:02:25.260> entirely<00:02:25.560> sure

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
it's just yeah so I'm not entirely sure

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.590 
it's just yeah so I'm not entirely sure
what<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.069> will<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.310> about<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.450> next

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
what I will do about it I think next

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.440 
what I will do about it I think next
time<00:02:27.900> I'll<00:02:28.110> I'll<00:02:28.680> definitely<00:02:29.610> try<00:02:29.820> out<00:02:29.970> oh

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
time I'll I'll definitely try out oh

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.510 
time I'll I'll definitely try out oh
yeah<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.709> line<00:02:31.980> that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
yeah here so there's a line that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.400 
yeah here so there's a line that
certainly<00:02:32.880> shouldn't<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.240> there

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
certainly shouldn't be there

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.580 
certainly shouldn't be there
so<00:02:35.070> next<00:02:35.250> time<00:02:35.550> I'll<00:02:35.850> I'll<00:02:36.239> probably<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:37.290> what

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so next time I'll I'll probably see what

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.340 
so next time I'll I'll probably see what
blurbed<00:02:38.310> us<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.880> how<00:02:39.750> their<00:02:39.930> quality

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
blurbed us and how their quality

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.670 
blurbed us and how their quality
compares<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.340> then<00:02:42.270> probably<00:02:42.680> make

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
compares to this and then probably make

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.380 
compares to this and then probably make
a<00:02:43.709> final<00:02:43.980> judgement<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.580> which<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:44.970> best
