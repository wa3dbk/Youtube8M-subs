are clean they need to dry an effective
approach<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.840> use<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.050> towel<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.710> place<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
approach is to use a towel and place the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.850 
approach is to use a towel and place the
gloves<00:02:24.550> inside<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> towel<00:02:25.630> put<00:02:26.620> pressure

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
gloves inside of the towel put pressure

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.040 
gloves inside of the towel put pressure
onto<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.460> towel<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:28.090> example<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:28.810> stand

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
onto the towel for example you can stand

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.530 
onto the towel for example you can stand
on<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.350> thus<00:02:30.070> letting<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.610> towel<00:02:30.820> absorb<00:02:31.390> the
