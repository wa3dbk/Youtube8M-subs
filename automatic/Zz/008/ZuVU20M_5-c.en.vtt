00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello to all these songs 25 and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 welcome to my channel and yes this 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 video and video presentation not 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
 very original but I had to do 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 so basically what you find on my 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.600
 video channel you find nothing from 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.800
 accurate in fact it's well that's more 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 class there is a video that if there is any 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 no you would find you will not find 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 nothing precise actually what do I 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.540
 do some matches from time to time 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 finally got rid of a good chef 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.710
 rare enough that I do it otherwise I have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.540
 had to do two or three for now 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.570
 you will soon find pvp 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.719
 but i'm waiting a little bit i would have already seen 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 a little bit, especially small ones 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.020
 videos like that we do not really 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.399
 report or what in fact it is just 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.320
 I ask myself a question I discovered 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.870
 a technique especially down to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.370
 illustrate these two examples 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 I had posed his halves elsewhere 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.140
 video excuse me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.900
 the second most popular video of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.570
 the chain so cassy rock label gave a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.979
 item when broken it is not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.150
 able I repeat it once and for all 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.510
 year easter to sand whether it's fine 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.159
 clear 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.409
 but if ever we could break it and this 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.350
 that she gives an object that and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.890
 technical matter it was to mount 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.990
 stairs 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.940
 you can go faster won 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.820
 almost four times 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.310
 of fake time and will deliver 20082 time 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.290
 so see if you have questions about 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.720
 minecraft you can ask them 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.310
 if they are a relevant minimum I 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.580
 will also try to h also funny 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.320
 as well 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.770
 it's not necessarily equal it's not 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.720
 necessarily serious so here you are 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.400
 also find I have never for 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.450
 the moment but no online videos 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.360
 know i'm programmers in free time 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.160
 not very high level I warn you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.930
 angers of the points m and if I have ideas 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.550
 I will publish minecraft tools that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.730
 can you be useful I put mine back 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.110
 that you can find in my door 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.020
 in the description I will put all 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.440
 the videos that are mentioned here you 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.320
 can find it in the description 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.200
 and download that I have another one 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.400
 other ebay that incurs of the moment I 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.950
 do not start coding a day 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 just still ensures imagination so 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.140
 that's what you'll find on 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.680
 machel that's a little bit quite 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.140
 there is nothing precise I the series you 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 maybe you ask me I'm not 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.010
 very good for the series because I 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.230
 did not know or what because I did not 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.970
 know not keep a schedule I 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.140
 am not very organized so if I 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.310
 was starting again if you really 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.989
 want to start something so 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.790
 you can say it but it absolutely 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.950
 not regular a fir tree so much be three 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.060
 episodes this week and not at all 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.280
 during the next three weeks 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 it is according to the time that I envy that 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.459
 I am here because here is a 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.739
 day what to do a video so 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.820
 I do not necessarily have the time a little less 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.730
 a day but I'm not necessarily 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.150
 the time for the series it follows not 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.320
 very good to respect something eh 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 to respect a timetable in 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.850
 this kind of there so the series for 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.780
 the moment not too much but if you ever 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.260
 really want one 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.030
 I say no no actually I'm open a 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.790
 little any proposals the objects 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.519
 also but well let's say that I tried 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 magic to sap was very successful 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.540
 cÃ©dric chauveau as now but 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.680

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.350
 it had become videos 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.410

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.640
 more interested but hey I can do 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.800
 on others I put my minecraft 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.210
