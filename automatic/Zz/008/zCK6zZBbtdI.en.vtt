00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
so instead of having it like this I can
have<00:01:51.540> everything<00:01:51.829> just<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.490> really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
really really concentrated so that's

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and yeah so you have to go yes go into a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.910 
and yeah so you have to go yes go into a
server<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.030> just<00:02:49.840> don't<00:02:50.140> control<00:02:50.530> your<00:02:50.710> mouse

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
server and just don't control your mouse

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.860 
server and just don't control your mouse
just<00:02:51.130> press<00:02:51.340> down<00:02:51.490> Mouse<00:02:51.820> one<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.540> see<00:02:52.720> how

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
just press down Mouse one and see how

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.760 
just press down Mouse one and see how
the<00:02:52.930> pattern<00:02:53.290> goes<00:02:53.650> see<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.030> like

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the pattern goes see it's like it's like

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.380 
the pattern goes see it's like it's like
seven<00:02:56.770> almost<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.280> goes<00:02:57.460> up<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.910> bit<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.300> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
seven almost it goes up a bit to the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.840 
seven almost it goes up a bit to the
left<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.750> right<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.410> enter<00:02:59.530> left<00:02:59.830> again<00:03:00.070> so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
left and right and enter left again so

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.310 
left and right and enter left again so
what<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.060> want<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.240> do<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.020> want<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
what you want to do is that you want to

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.500 
what you want to do is that you want to
think<00:03:02.830> like<00:03:02.950> okay<00:03:03.310> how<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.970> pattern<00:03:04.330> and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
think like okay how is the pattern and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.750 
think like okay how is the pattern and
when<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.840> spray<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.350> try<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.130> think<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.670> so

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
when you spray it try to think of it so

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.280 
when you spray it try to think of it so
you<00:03:06.850> want<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> make<00:03:07.210> it<00:03:07.300> as<00:03:07.420> small<00:03:07.600> as<00:03:07.660> possible

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.150 

that<00:03:11.290> wasn't<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.590> best<00:03:11.680> spray<00:03:11.920> I've<00:03:12.010> ever

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
that wasn't the best spray I've ever

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.830 
that wasn't the best spray I've ever
done<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.490> yeah<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.150> see<00:03:13.330> like<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
done but yeah you see like the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.790 
done but yeah you see like the
difference<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:16.510> like<00:03:16.630> no<00:03:16.950> controlling<00:03:19.800> goes

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
difference it's like no controlling goes

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.250 
difference it's like no controlling goes
up<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.220> left<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.300> yeah<00:03:28.480> think<00:03:28.900> about<00:03:28.990> what

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
up and left and so yeah think about what

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.720 
up and left and so yeah think about what
you're<00:03:29.380> doing<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.710> can<00:03:29.890> do<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.280> same<00:03:30.460> with<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
you're doing I can do it same with the a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:41.430 
you're doing I can do it same with the a
K<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.430> add<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.790> K<00:03:38.520> clean<00:03:39.520> ball<00:03:40.440> somewhere

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
K so we add the a K clean ball somewhere

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.090 
K so we add the a K clean ball somewhere
I<00:03:41.800> do<00:03:42.250> hear<00:03:42.460> the<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.210> K<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.930> okay<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:44.890> I'll

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
I do hear the a K is like okay so I'll

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.930 

and<00:03:56.040> pretty<00:03:57.040> much<00:03:57.100> states<00:03:57.460> in<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.640> middle<00:03:57.850> in

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
you've been doing this for a while you

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.420 
you've been doing this for a while you
will<00:04:13.930> feel<00:04:14.290> how<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.910> like<00:04:15.910> how<00:04:16.480> do<00:04:16.540> recoil

will feel how the like how do recoil

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.010 
will feel how the like how do recoil
moves<00:04:18.430> like<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:19.030> feel<00:04:19.480> your<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.750> drag<00:04:19.989> down

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
moves like you feel your to drag down

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.230 
moves like you feel your to drag down
because<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.739> know<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.370> have<00:04:21.610> something<00:04:21.910> aim

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
because you know you have something aim

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.750 
because you know you have something aim
for<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:23.470> feel<00:04:23.830> it's<00:04:24.010> going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.430> drag<00:04:24.640> it

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
for and you feel it's going to drag it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.720 
for and you feel it's going to drag it
down<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:24.940> when<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.660> not<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:29.340> mean<00:04:30.340> it's<00:04:30.610> try

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
down and when to not so I mean it's try

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.000 
down and when to not so I mean it's try
to<00:04:30.790> control<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.360> mean<00:04:31.480> okay<00:04:32.170> now<00:04:32.320> yet<00:04:32.800> again

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
to control it I mean okay now yet again

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.540 
to control it I mean okay now yet again
it's<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.250> pretty<00:04:33.460> close<00:04:33.760> distance<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.550> I'm

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
it's a pretty close distance so and I'm

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.770 
it's a pretty close distance so and I'm
but<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.730> mean<00:04:36.880> this<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.300> difference<00:04:37.690> this

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
but I mean this is the difference this

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.210 
but I mean this is the difference this
is<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> distance<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.440> should<00:04:38.680> spray<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:39.070> I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
is the distance you should spray on I

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.460 
is the distance you should spray on I
mean<00:04:39.370> if<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.850> guy<00:04:39.970> would<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.180> down<00:04:40.570> example<00:04:41.410> to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
mean if a guy would be down example to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.530 
mean if a guy would be down example to
take<00:04:41.590> his<00:04:41.710> pawn<00:04:41.920> here<00:04:42.130> you<00:04:42.910> know<00:04:43.060> what<00:04:43.420> you

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
take his pawn here you know what you

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.080 
take his pawn here you know what you
don't<00:04:43.690> want<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.900> spray<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.830> mean<00:04:45.460> if<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.940> can

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
don't want to spray I mean if you can

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.520 
don't want to spray I mean if you can
control<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:46.570> you'll<00:04:46.960> probably<00:04:47.200> kill<00:04:47.470> him

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
control it you'll probably kill him

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.030 
control it you'll probably kill him
anyway

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
anyway

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.460 
anyway
but<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.640> could<00:04:48.820> do<00:04:49.420> this<00:04:49.480> better<00:04:49.870> where's<00:04:50.260> the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
but you could do this better where's the

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.090 
but you could do this better where's the
few<00:04:50.620> bullets<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:52.590> can<00:04:53.590> pretty<00:04:53.740> much<00:04:53.800> show<00:04:54.040> you

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
few bullets I can pretty much show you

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.030 
few bullets I can pretty much show you
like<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.550> range<00:04:54.760> when<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:56.350> spray<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.740> one<00:04:56.890> not

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
like the range when to spray and one not

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.910 
like the range when to spray and one not
to<00:04:57.100> spray<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.390> we<00:04:58.660> can<00:04:58.780> start<00:04:58.930> off<00:04:58.990> by<00:04:59.230> this

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
to spray so we can start off by this

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.060 
to spray so we can start off by this
distance<00:05:00.370> here<00:05:01.210> let's<00:05:02.110> say<00:05:02.260> there's<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.560> guy<00:05:02.770> in

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
distance here let's say there's a guy in

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.800 
distance here let's say there's a guy in
down<00:05:03.340> here<00:05:03.700> in<00:05:03.880> Pitt<00:05:04.090> there's<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.720> guy<00:05:04.840> here<00:05:06.810> of

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
down here in Pitt there's a guy here of

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.570 
down here in Pitt there's a guy here of
course<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.650> can't<00:05:08.830> spray<00:05:09.190> from<00:05:09.340> this

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
course you can't spray from this

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.820 
course you can't spray from this
distance<00:05:10.200> you<00:05:11.200> might<00:05:11.350> be<00:05:11.500> able<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.680> get<00:05:11.800> a

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
distance you might be able to get a

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.620 
distance you might be able to get a
lucky<00:05:12.010> shot<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.700> mean<00:05:12.850> that's<00:05:13.120> not<00:05:13.270> optimal

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
lucky shot but I mean that's not optimal

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.930 
lucky shot but I mean that's not optimal
you<00:05:13.870> want<00:05:14.260> to<00:05:14.350> like<00:05:14.560> either<00:05:14.770> one<00:05:15.100> tap<00:05:15.370> or<00:05:15.640> two

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
you want to like either one tap or two

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.050 
you want to like either one tap or two
to<00:05:16.480> shoot<00:05:16.600> bears<00:05:16.840> if<00:05:17.080> if<00:05:17.260> they're<00:05:17.550> just<00:05:18.550> shoot

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
to shoot bears if if they're just shoot

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.870 
to shoot bears if if they're just shoot
one<00:05:19.500> I'll<00:05:20.500> try<00:05:20.980> always<00:05:21.280> cheap<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.730> when

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
one I'll try always cheap like when

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.340 
one I'll try always cheap like when
you're<00:05:22.030> tapping<00:05:22.270> always<00:05:22.840> try<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.080> move

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
you're tapping always try to move

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.190 
you're tapping always try to move
yourself<00:05:23.830> cuz<00:05:23.980> if<00:05:24.190> you're<00:05:24.370> standing<00:05:24.670> still

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
yourself cuz if you're standing still

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.110 
yourself cuz if you're standing still
you'll<00:05:26.200> be<00:05:26.350> easier<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.890> hit<00:05:27.010> then<00:05:27.910> it's<00:05:28.060> the

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
you'll be easier to hit then it's the

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.730 
you'll be easier to hit then it's the
same<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.540> probably<00:05:29.290> understand<00:05:29.680> it

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
same like you probably understand it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.230 
same like you probably understand it
like<00:05:30.040> know<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.340> as<00:05:30.430> well<00:05:30.580> like<00:05:30.850> every<00:05:31.090> time

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
like know it as well like every time

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.270 
like know it as well like every time
there's<00:05:31.450> a<00:05:31.510> guy<00:05:31.630> running<00:05:31.900> it's<00:05:32.770> harder<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.190> hit

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
there's a guy running it's harder to hit

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.430 
there's a guy running it's harder to hit
the<00:05:33.520> neck<00:05:33.670> is<00:05:33.790> standing<00:05:33.910> still<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.540> what<00:05:35.350> you

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
the neck is standing still so what you

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.380 
the neck is standing still so what you
can<00:05:35.560> do<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.010> can<00:05:36.130> shoot<00:05:36.820> one<00:05:37.120> or<00:05:37.270> two

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
can do is that you can shoot one or two

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.659 
can do is that you can shoot one or two
bullets<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:37.960> move<00:05:38.169> like<00:05:39.070> exactly<00:05:39.520> when

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
bullets and move like exactly when

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:47.160 
bullets and move like exactly when
you're<00:05:39.790> standing<00:05:40.060> still<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.480> fire<00:05:40.720> -<00:05:40.930> bullets

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.700 

that<00:05:47.710> makes<00:05:47.920> you<00:05:48.010> even<00:05:48.040> harder<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:48.730> hit<00:05:48.850> and

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
that makes you even harder to hit and

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.770 
that makes you even harder to hit and
they<00:05:50.710> like<00:05:51.130> they<00:05:51.460> have<00:05:51.670> to<00:05:51.880> keep<00:05:52.090> on<00:05:52.240> aiming<00:05:52.630> at

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
they like they have to keep on aiming at

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.350 
they like they have to keep on aiming at
you<00:05:53.020> since<00:05:53.440> you're<00:05:53.560> moving<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.150> you'll<00:05:55.150> get<00:05:55.330> a

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
you since you're moving and you'll get a

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.320 
you since you're moving and you'll get a
bigger<00:05:55.570> like<00:05:56.020> advantage<00:05:56.530> in<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.770> duel

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
bigger like advantage in the duel

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.120 
bigger like advantage in the duel
so<00:05:58.440> yeah<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.710> let's<00:06:00.430> say<00:06:00.610> I<00:06:00.640> move<00:06:00.880> down<00:06:01.090> a<00:06:01.150> bit

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
so yeah and let's say I move down a bit

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.270 
so yeah and let's say I move down a bit
let's<00:06:03.130> say<00:06:03.250> I'm<00:06:03.490> here<00:06:04.620> okay<00:06:05.620> this<00:06:05.770> is<00:06:05.890> still

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
let's say I'm here okay this is still

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.460 
let's say I'm here okay this is still
pretty<00:06:06.520> far<00:06:06.640> distance<00:06:06.790> but<00:06:07.270> here<00:06:08.260> you<00:06:08.350> can

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
pretty far distance but here you can

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.420 
pretty far distance but here you can
probably<00:06:08.590> do<00:06:08.800> a<00:06:08.830> three<00:06:09.160> with<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.460> first<00:06:11.430> like

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
probably do a three with it first like

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.460 
probably do a three with it first like
the<00:06:12.580> closer<00:06:12.820> you<00:06:13.030> get<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.480> more<00:06:13.780> bullets<00:06:14.380> you

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
the closer you get the more bullets you

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.510 
the closer you get the more bullets you
can<00:06:14.530> burst<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:15.630> mean<00:06:16.630> and<00:06:16.840> same<00:06:17.740> here<00:06:17.950> like<00:06:18.190> keep

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
can burst I mean and same here like keep

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.510 
can burst I mean and same here like keep
on<00:06:18.670> moving<00:06:19.030> when<00:06:19.180> you're<00:06:19.300> shooting<00:06:19.420> shoot

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
on moving when you're shooting shoot

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.150 
on moving when you're shooting shoot
shoot<00:06:21.520> 3<00:06:21.850> bullets<00:06:22.290> stop

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.900 

if<00:06:27.160> keep<00:06:27.340> on<00:06:27.490> doing<00:06:27.700> that<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:29.490> let's<00:06:30.490> say<00:06:30.670> I'm

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
if keep on doing that and let's say I'm

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.660 
if keep on doing that and let's say I'm
here<00:06:31.450> like<00:06:31.810> here<00:06:32.350> something<00:06:33.130> somewhere<00:06:33.430> here

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
here like here something somewhere here

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.350 
here like here something somewhere here
like<00:06:33.940> there's<00:06:35.430> like<00:06:36.430> no<00:06:36.730> that's<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.240> on<00:06:37.330> a

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
like there's like no that's the on a

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.630 
like there's like no that's the on a
monitor<00:06:37.780> here<00:06:37.810> like<00:06:38.110> from<00:06:38.230> here<00:06:38.470> to<00:06:38.740> here<00:06:39.040> this

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
monitor here like from here to here this

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.220 
monitor here like from here to here this
distance<00:06:39.940> from<00:06:40.270> where<00:06:40.540> you<00:06:40.630> can<00:06:40.780> start<00:06:41.050> maybe

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
distance from where you can start maybe

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.080 
distance from where you can start maybe
spraying<00:06:41.940> if<00:06:42.940> you're<00:06:43.120> gonna<00:06:43.300> spring<00:06:43.660> so<00:06:45.090> and

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
spraying if you're gonna spring so and

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.710 
spraying if you're gonna spring so and
if<00:06:46.960> you<00:06:47.290> spray<00:06:47.650> I<00:06:47.950> mean<00:06:48.370> you<00:06:49.150> can't<00:06:49.420> do<00:06:49.690> like

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
if you spray I mean you can't do like

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.680 
if you spray I mean you can't do like
this<00:06:49.990> anymore

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
this anymore

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.120 
this anymore
it's<00:06:52.690> not<00:06:52.840> very<00:06:53.200> good<00:06:53.320> so<00:06:53.740> I<00:06:54.040> mean<00:06:55.650> just<00:06:56.650> try<00:06:57.040> to

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
it's not very good so I mean just try to

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.550 
it's not very good so I mean just try to
trace<00:06:57.580> like<00:06:58.060> practice<00:06:58.660> spraying<00:06:58.960> cause<00:06:59.380> any

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
trace like practice spraying cause any
