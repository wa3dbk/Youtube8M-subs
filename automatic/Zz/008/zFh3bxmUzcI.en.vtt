00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
year a big difference between the two

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
year a big difference between the two
with<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.390> s3<00:00:37.020> version<00:00:37.380> from<00:00:37.500> last<00:00:37.739> year<00:00:38.070> we

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
with the s3 version from last year we

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.889 
with the s3 version from last year we
could<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> tell<00:00:39.000> around<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> edges<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
could do a tell around the edges a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.229 
could do a tell around the edges a
little<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.530> curved<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> rounded<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
little more curved and rounded so it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.049 
little more curved and rounded so it
kinda<00:00:42.480> has<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> better<00:00:42.899> feel<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> hand
