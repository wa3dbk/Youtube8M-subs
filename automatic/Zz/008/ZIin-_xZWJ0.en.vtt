going to be drawing Wolverine from the
x-men<00:00:14.219> series<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.389> getting<00:00:15.630> started<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.230> begin

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
x-men series so getting started we begin

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.529 
x-men series so getting started we begin
as<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> usually<00:00:17.369> begin<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:17.820> construction

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
as I usually begin with construction

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.480 
as I usually begin with construction
lines<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> pose<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> basic

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
lines so we get the pose in a basic

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000 
lines so we get the pose in a basic
shape<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> body<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.260> case<00:00:22.320> Wolverine

more effective and clearer way where
things<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.430> I've<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
things are so now that I've done that

the next thing I'm doing is going to the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
the next thing I'm doing is going to the
line<00:00:59.430> work<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> always<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> different

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
line work now this is always a different

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.399 
line work now this is always a different
sort<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> process<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.409> very

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sort of process because with very

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.530 
sort of process because with very
cartoony<00:01:05.220> characters<00:01:05.430> things<00:01:06.299> are<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.510> bit

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
cartoony characters things are a bit

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.780 
cartoony characters things are a bit
more<00:01:06.689> bubbly<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.560> comic<00:01:08.040> style<00:01:08.310> characters

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
more bubbly with comic style characters

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.990 
more bubbly with comic style characters
like<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.180> while<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:11.400> bubbly<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like this while it is a bit bubbly it's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870 
like this while it is a bit bubbly it's
also<00:01:12.560> based<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.189> lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.460> line<00:01:14.670> weight

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
also based on a lot of line weight

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
also based on a lot of line weight
variation<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.600> stuff<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.350> more

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
variation and stuff you want to get more

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890 
variation and stuff you want to get more
of<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.770> stylistic<00:01:17.189> look<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> don't<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.840> it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
of a stylistic look so you don't want it

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740 
of a stylistic look so you don't want it
to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.140> too<00:01:19.320> bubbly<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.790> saying<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.390> don't

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
to be too bubbly as I was saying I don't

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
to be too bubbly as I was saying I don't
know<00:01:21.810> why<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> keep<00:01:22.200> saying<00:01:22.259> bubbly<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> doesn't

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
know why I keep saying bubbly it doesn't

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:23.780 
know why I keep saying bubbly it doesn't
mean<00:01:23.430> anything

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
mean anything

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.780 
mean anything
anyways<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:25.439> through<00:01:25.680> making<00:01:26.100> sure<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
anyways so going through making sure to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.450 
anyways so going through making sure to
have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> good<00:01:27.150> variation<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> line<00:01:28.140> mates

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
have a good variation in the line mates

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.649 
have a good variation in the line mates
basically<00:01:29.460> knowing<00:01:29.970> when<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.479> should

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
basically knowing when it should

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.060 
basically knowing when it should
beginner<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> should<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.680> thicker

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
beginner and when it should be thicker

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.999 
beginner and when it should be thicker
and<00:01:32.909> also<00:01:33.240> keeping<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.720> mind<00:01:33.869> again<00:01:34.229> less<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and also keeping in mind again less is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
and also keeping in mind again less is
more<00:01:35.040> that's<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:35.640> important<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.450> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
more that's an important thing that I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.179 
more that's an important thing that I
constantly<00:01:37.049> say<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> don't<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
constantly say because you don't want to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
constantly say because you don't want to
add<00:01:38.280> too<00:01:38.549> many<00:01:38.729> lines<00:01:39.060> random<00:01:39.720> lines<00:01:40.049> for

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
example in the muscles I've added these

random thin lines to kind of show the
ripped<00:01:44.759> nature<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> muscles<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.320> people

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
ripped nature of the muscles as people

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.310 
ripped nature of the muscles as people
would<00:01:46.710> say<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.020> no

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
would say so you know with you know no

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.090 
would say so you know with you know no
fat<00:01:49.590> content<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.250> his<00:01:50.399> skin<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.079> large

rippling<00:01:53.100> muscles<00:01:53.520> he's<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> have

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
rippling muscles he's going to have

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
rippling muscles he's going to have
those<00:01:54.720> lines<00:01:55.020> because<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
those lines because that's how the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
those lines because that's how the
muscles<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.610> divided<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.540> too

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
muscles are divided but if you do too

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.389 
muscles are divided but if you do too
much<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.619> ends<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:58.979> looking<00:01:59.130> either

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
much of them it ends up looking either

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.969 
much of them it ends up looking either
grotesque<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.119> unrealistic<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.619> anyways

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
grotesque or unrealistic so anyways

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
grotesque or unrealistic so anyways
going<00:02:02.219> through<00:02:02.520> I've<00:02:02.729> added<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> few<00:02:03.149> details

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
going through I've added a few details

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.149 
going through I've added a few details
like<00:02:04.049> rips<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> show

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
like rips in the show

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.700 
like rips in the show
and<00:02:05.909> some<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> things<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> fingers

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and some of the things on the fingers

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.980 
and some of the things on the fingers
what<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.009> call<00:02:08.160> them<00:02:08.250> knuckle<00:02:08.700> lines<00:02:08.990> but

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
what do you call them knuckle lines but

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.500 
what do you call them knuckle lines but
I've<00:02:10.110> left<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.560> claws<00:02:10.830> out<00:02:11.069> reason<00:02:12.030> being<00:02:12.270> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
I've left the claws out reason being is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.860 
I've left the claws out reason being is
that<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:14.220> shape<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.060> them<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> be

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
that the shape of them is going to be

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.330 
that the shape of them is going to be
tricky<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.350> get<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.680> I'm<00:02:16.800> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.190> them

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
tricky to get so I'm going to do them

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.610 
tricky to get so I'm going to do them
separately<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.720> first<00:02:19.020> by<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
separately so I do this first by on a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.059 
separately so I do this first by on a
different<00:02:20.220> layer<00:02:20.400> during<00:02:21.270> red<00:02:21.840> lines<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
different layer during red lines in the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.590 
different layer during red lines in the
direction<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.760> want<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> find<00:02:24.330> them<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
direction that I want to find them and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.180 
direction that I want to find them and
then<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.870> draw<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> claws<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.160> on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
then I draw the claws now this is all on

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.680 
then I draw the claws now this is all on
a<00:02:26.340> separate<00:02:26.760> layer

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
a separate layer

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.300 
a separate layer
whether<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.410> flash<00:02:28.650> or<00:02:28.800> Photoshop

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
whether it be in flash or Photoshop

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.860 
whether it be in flash or Photoshop
whatever<00:02:29.640> works<00:02:29.880> but<00:02:30.360> that's<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:30.690> I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
whatever works but that's because I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.050 
whatever works but that's because I
don't<00:02:31.080> want<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.410> mess<00:02:31.620> around<00:02:31.770> or<00:02:32.160> screw<00:02:32.970> up

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
don't want to mess around or screw up

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.520 
don't want to mess around or screw up
the<00:02:33.209> line<00:02:33.360> work<00:02:33.540> I've<00:02:33.690> already<00:02:33.930> done<00:02:34.080> off<00:02:34.319> his

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the line work I've already done off his

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.500 
the line work I've already done off his
body<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.310> I'm<00:02:35.400> going<00:02:35.640> through<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.090> doing<00:02:36.120> this

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
body so I'm going through and doing this

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.110 
body so I'm going through and doing this
separately<00:02:37.140> first<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.190> afterwards

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
separately first and then afterwards

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.699 
separately first and then afterwards
I'll<00:02:39.239> be<00:02:39.390> combining<00:02:39.780> them<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.380> takes<00:02:40.590> a

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
I'll be combining them so it takes a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.840 
I'll be combining them so it takes a
little<00:02:40.830> bit<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.100> refinement<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.730> it's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
little bit of refinement because it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.360 
little bit of refinement because it's
quite<00:02:42.060> difficult<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.630> get<00:02:42.870> at<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.950> accurate

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
quite difficult to get at the accurate

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.490 
quite difficult to get at the accurate
proportions<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.970> perspective<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.200> claws

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
proportions and perspective of the claws

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.890 
proportions and perspective of the claws
when<00:02:46.830> they're<00:02:47.040> curved<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.239> an<00:02:48.390> angle<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
when they're curved and on an angle and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.809 
when they're curved and on an angle and
kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.380> panning<00:02:49.769> out<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
kind of panning out like that so it

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:51.890 
kind of panning out like that so it
takes<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.269> practice<00:02:51.420> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
takes a bit of practice and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.530 
takes a bit of practice and
understanding<00:02:52.590> shape<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.880> things<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.330> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
understanding shape and things like that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780 
understanding shape and things like that
but<00:02:55.440> when<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.650> got<00:02:55.830> them<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> place<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.700> I'm

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
but when I got them to a place that I'm

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.130 
but when I got them to a place that I'm
happy<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.390> merged<00:02:57.690> them<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
happy with them I merged them with the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.110 
happy with them I merged them with the
original<00:02:58.530> drawing<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:58.980> then<00:02:59.100> I'm<00:02:59.340> ready<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
original drawing and then I'm ready to

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.900 
original drawing and then I'm ready to
do<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.390> coloring<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> step<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:02.250> which<00:03:02.640> I

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
do the coloring so the step in which I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.729 
do the coloring so the step in which I
do<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> coloring<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> common<00:03:04.590> thing

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
do the coloring this is a common thing

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.710 
do the coloring this is a common thing
that<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.430> cel<00:03:05.730> shading<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.180> coloring<00:03:06.540> is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
that I do in cel shading the coloring is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.630 
that I do in cel shading the coloring is
by<00:03:07.110> outlining<00:03:07.620> areas<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.130> where<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> shadow

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
by outlining areas of where the shadow

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.940 
by outlining areas of where the shadow
go<00:03:08.940> now<00:03:09.120> in<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.480> case<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.049> wanted<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.799> be<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
go now in this case I wanted it to be a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.890 
go now in this case I wanted it to be a
fairly<00:03:11.340> dramatic<00:03:11.610> sort<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.329> light<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.840> I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
fairly dramatic sort of light so I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
fairly dramatic sort of light so I
wanted<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.260> backlight<00:03:13.980> nothing<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.610> front

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
wanted a backlight nothing in the front

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
wanted a backlight nothing in the front
but<00:03:15.060> all<00:03:15.420> kind<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.019> highlighted<00:03:16.709> from<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
but all kind of highlighted from the
