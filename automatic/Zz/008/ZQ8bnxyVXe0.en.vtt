00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello to all so today I you 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.830
 show the different positions 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.599
 pessoa the four ways of m so if 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.619
 you want to go see how to put a 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.070
 surfing work 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.079
 click on my right finger and if you 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.150
 want to see how m a beam to 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:33.360
 click on it so there it is put 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.570
 in the low position 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.290
 hence the glow of my horse and he is 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.560
 not it is not tight so your 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.590
 horse must be fully 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:57.880
 finally the pessoa must be entirely me 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:01:01.630
 that's it and that's it for the master 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:06.329
 imposition stick and not the police must 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.329
 maybe must remain attached to the dead 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.540
 and so you take the carabiner here 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.890
 and you go the paceden take two 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.390
 interiors at the bottom ring at our feet 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.040
 all the way down there is normally nothing 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.040
 is one and therefore you do not 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.600
 the device on the other side 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:35.290
 so we take two carabiners and we go 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:37.930
 come and place it all the way down here and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.610
 your horse is normally already in 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.440
 position to work next if you 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 want to put your pc in position 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.340
 intermediate orbit medium 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.119
 you will do the same thing so you go 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.310
 pick up the carabiners like everything 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.049
 play with his carabiner there you go 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.340
 the task is exactly in the same place 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.229
 that where we put the rope we see 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.069
 there where we pass the rope or even 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.890
 water and so have the task like that with 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.120
 the carabiner and chili 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.120
 he m like this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.370
 pessoa in position scott you go 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.910
 do the same on the duo ring lo 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:35.470
 the ring just 2 above the bottom of the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 news from the bottom so here for you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.510
 put your pessoa back up 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.970
 you go in so that pulls a little bit 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.190
 more on the mouth 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 so that's the attitude that your horse 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.030
 must have gone up I do not know if this is the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.510
 intermediate or low position where I 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.310
 know what it is it is in water and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.220
 to finish if you wanted to put your 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.130

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.170
 will square meter in the same place there 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:13.060
 where did I put this year lifting lifting 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:26.680
 licking you put your carabiners 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:30.630
 any time so your sweat 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.630
 does that give this 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.270
 so now you know 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.660
 the different positions of the pessoa 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.980
