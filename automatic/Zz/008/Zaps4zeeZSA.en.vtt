00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
got to admit the fact that this tank

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.570 
got to admit the fact that this tank
here<00:02:05.420> fits<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.259> framework<00:02:06.649> beautifully<00:02:07.250> but

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
here fits the framework beautifully but

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.370 
here fits the framework beautifully but
do<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.759> recognize<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.420> by<00:02:08.899> any<00:02:09.020> chance<00:02:09.200> you

do you recognize it by any chance you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.860 
do you recognize it by any chance you
recognize<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.069> well<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.399> says<00:02:10.550> LX<00:02:10.850> at<00:02:11.030> 750<00:02:11.660> tang
