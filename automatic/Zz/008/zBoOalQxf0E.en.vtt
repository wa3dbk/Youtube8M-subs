00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.440
 where Aldi pv 240 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.790
 where all IP and then a few digits but was often seen what is written in 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.050
 this case you the v 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.440
 so this is preceded by stock market part that is that this is 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 Instrument is very diverse and you really have quite a lot 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.090
 Musical possibilities that are great to implement with this instrument 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.980
 can 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.510
 exist what can you still and what to say 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.010
 Basel from so the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.990
 Test features because the PV 250 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 So for one thing, we have an excellent keyboard a GHS keyboard 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.520
 also with a different weighting forms what to the treble 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.620
 Area so that you really have the feeling like a grand piano 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 expresses itself simply to the instrument networking 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 Diandra feel like a real keyboard and the right one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.450
 acoustic Kita Leuer importantly accurate and you can now see more often 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.650
 Icelandair just mentioned here that you also have a variety of features 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.370
 and that is very nice so you can go next to these 400 different ones 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.520
 Sounds you have here in the instrument also with a companion car Martic 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.150
 play 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.850
 and this companion car Matic can be controlled as cyber taxes 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 with harmonies Acorn in the left hand or that one the Accor of the identifier 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.280
 has the whole keyboard 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.950
 Wonderfully, percent of the testing plans mean the display in the middle of what 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.259
 Function has that the principle that Erich knows conventional all details go 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.759
 but 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.629
 You can select various views there seemingly 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.939
 so to the simple percent to a simplified that of course that serves 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.260
 whole operating concept because all the information has all the sounds and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.550
 Percent one will be able to select over this display but on the other 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.230
 we also have a great feature that is all you need a game or 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.690
 Surcharge knee the case an LED for this we have here a USB for the white 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.439
 he just that things important see her left down in the corner of the camera 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.139
 Percent, the normal investigator will also be able to use his small USB interface 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.320
 I actually do with that 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.470
 So here you can, of course, save your own registrations 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.640
 own EKD percent songs and songs that you save recorded but to 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 Example also available as the Faist 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.670
 A then the Mittelbau the Trabant Display were here again very 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.700
 can be beautifully presented by then aufs a song from wild 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.950
 Court will then be seen as the closest perfect percent scores in the test 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.770
 amazing 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.449
 okay with what - because Dr 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.790
 Henschke and the calculated price that is natural 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.120
 that is cheaper that I understood compared to our CVP 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.780
 is percent live where is the price about the first time we had 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.720

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
 Hellstern dp2 the waiver in a price range of 15 and 9 90 euros and the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.809
 is really what then socially called new 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.590
 that sounds like that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.020
 where do you know what i think that was for march nano from the fair 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.679
 perfectly adequate 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.270
 find more 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.010

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.749
 Arndt Messi's Paso website where we have more features about the model 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:44.009
