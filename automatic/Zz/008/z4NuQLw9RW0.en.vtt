00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.390 

pretty<00:01:26.480> cool<00:01:26.660> let's<00:01:27.290> go<00:01:27.380> over<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.830> controls

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
pretty cool let's go over the controls

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.070 
pretty cool let's go over the controls
really<00:01:28.700> quick<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.030> we<00:01:29.690> have<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> blend

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
really quick here we have a blend

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.190 
really quick here we have a blend
control<00:01:34.150> we've<00:01:35.150> got<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.420> mode<00:01:35.630> control<00:01:35.990> which

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
control we've got a mode control which

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.800 
control we've got a mode control which
we've<00:01:36.380> go<00:01:36.560> from<00:01:36.770> low-pass<00:01:37.600> which<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.690> right

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
we've go from low-pass which is right

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:56.350 
we've go from low-pass which is right
here<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.140> band<00:01:39.410> pass<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:48.140> high-pass<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:56.240> like

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
here to band pass to high-pass just like

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.460 
here to band pass to high-pass just like
on<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.540> cue<00:01:56.690> Tron<00:02:01.180> go<00:02:02.180> back<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.450> low-pass<00:02:02.780> here

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.730 

now<00:02:06.520> we've<00:02:07.520> got<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:08.440> couple<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.530> really<00:02:09.649> cool

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
now we've got a couple of really cool

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.110 
now we've got a couple of really cool
controls<00:02:10.190> right<00:02:10.280> here<00:02:10.340> we've<00:02:10.640> got<00:02:10.670> attack

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
controls right here we've got attack

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.620 
controls right here we've got attack
decay<00:02:11.510> start<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.350> stop<00:02:12.620> now<00:02:13.570> instead<00:02:14.570> of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
decay start and stop now instead of

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.890 
decay start and stop now instead of
having<00:02:14.930> your<00:02:15.830> up<00:02:16.130> or<00:02:16.400> down<00:02:16.760> switch<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:17.780> you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
having your up or down switch like you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.930 
having your up or down switch like you
had<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.230> cue<00:02:18.410> Tron<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.400> cue<00:02:19.700> balls

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
had on the cue Tron on the cue balls

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.090 
had on the cue Tron on the cue balls
you've<00:02:20.780> got<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.080> start<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.470> stop<00:02:21.560> controls

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
you've got to start and stop controls

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.390 
you've got to start and stop controls
start<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.240> stop<00:02:23.590> basically<00:02:24.590> tell<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.220> where

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
start and stop basically tell you where

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.030 
start and stop basically tell you where
the<00:02:25.519> beginning<00:02:26.060> frequency<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.320> then

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the beginning frequency is and then

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.800 
the beginning frequency is and then
where<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> ending<00:02:28.580> frequency<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:29.690> you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
where the ending frequency is so if you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.199 
where the ending frequency is so if you
want<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.080> have<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.500> down<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.430> up<00:02:31.580> effect<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:35.090> go

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
want to have a down to up effect you go

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.430 
want to have a down to up effect you go
have<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.540> start<00:02:36.790> sort<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:38.320> starting<00:02:39.320> at<00:02:39.380> a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
have the start sort of starting at a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.290 
have the start sort of starting at a
frequency<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:40.100> higher<00:02:40.730> than<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.000> stop

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
frequency that's higher than the stop

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.120 
frequency that's higher than the stop
now<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:41.989> reverse<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.320> by<00:02:42.620> getting<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
now you can reverse it by getting the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.250 
now you can reverse it by getting the
start<00:02:43.400> past<00:02:43.700> 12<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.300> stop<00:02:44.540> before<00:02:44.989> 12

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
start past 12 and the stop before 12

00:02:45.260 --> 00:03:01.950 
start past 12 and the stop before 12
fire<00:02:46.030> make<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.120> really<00:02:47.450> dramatic<00:02:48.080> here

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.360 

well<00:03:02.960> you<00:03:03.140> get<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.350> idea<00:03:03.380> some<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.280> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
well you get the idea some of the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:16.390 
well you get the idea some of the
controls<00:03:04.640> on<00:03:04.730> here<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.910> key<00:03:05.540> there<00:03:05.960> we<00:03:06.050> go<00:03:15.400> let's

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
controls on here a key there we go let's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:35.140 
controls on here a key there we go let's
go<00:03:16.550> back<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:16.880> classic<00:03:17.090> down<00:03:17.540> up<00:03:34.000> now<00:03:35.000> let's

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
go back to a classic down up now let's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.550 
go back to a classic down up now let's
play<00:03:35.270> with<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.480> attack<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.960> decay<00:03:36.080> controls

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
play with the attack and decay controls

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.990 
play with the attack and decay controls
they<00:03:36.770> are<00:03:36.980> just<00:03:37.490> what<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.670> think<00:03:37.880> they<00:03:37.970> are

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
they are just what you think they are

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.260 
they are just what you think they are
attack<00:03:38.900> basically<00:03:39.530> delay<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.460> your<00:03:40.880> initial

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
attack basically delay is your initial

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.140 
attack basically delay is your initial
envelope<00:03:42.080> sweep<00:03:44.260> sort<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.320> goes<00:03:45.440> wah<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.970> get

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
envelope sweep sort of goes wah and get

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.460 
envelope sweep sort of goes wah and get
even<00:03:47.390> more<00:03:47.510> roll<00:03:48.280> roll<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:51.170> that's<00:03:51.320> pretty

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
even more roll roll so that's pretty

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.880 
even more roll roll so that's pretty
cool

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
cool

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.710 
cool
delay<00:03:52.580> is<00:03:52.610> basically<00:03:53.030> your<00:03:53.180> recovery<00:03:53.630> time

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
delay is basically your recovery time

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:04.610 
delay is basically your recovery time
between<00:03:54.470> notes<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.940> if<00:04:02.000> you're<00:04:02.120> playing<00:04:02.360> war

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
between notes so if you're playing war

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.110 
between notes so if you're playing war

if you play more staccato notes you want

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.910 
if you play more staccato notes you want
to<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.680> less<00:04:13.130> recovery<00:04:13.640> time

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.439 

I'm<00:05:27.069> going<00:05:27.400> direct<00:05:27.699> here<00:05:27.879> so<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.120> don't<00:05:28.210> hear

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
I'm going direct here so you don't hear

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.740 
I'm going direct here so you don't hear
the<00:05:28.569> crazy<00:05:28.930> resonance<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:30.699> would<00:05:31.449> otherwise

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
the crazy resonance that would otherwise

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.260 
the crazy resonance that would otherwise
be<00:05:31.990> shaking<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.710> room<00:05:32.919> but<00:05:33.879> trust<00:05:34.090> me<00:05:34.120> it's

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
be shaking the room but trust me it's

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.809 
be shaking the room but trust me it's
intense<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.830> now<00:05:35.949> you<00:05:36.009> have<00:05:36.159> your<00:05:36.250> sensitivity

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
intense so now you have your sensitivity

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:37.950 
intense so now you have your sensitivity
control<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.240> this<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.449> basically<00:05:37.599> you<00:05:37.840> just

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.869 
control and this is basically you just

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
want to adjust your sensitivity

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.700 
want to adjust your sensitivity

depending on the output of your base or

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.320 
depending on the output of your base or
you<00:05:45.580> know<00:05:45.669> depending<00:05:45.819> on<00:05:46.090> whether<00:05:46.210> you're

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
you know depending on whether you're

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:56.339 
you know depending on whether you're
playing<00:05:46.449> slap<00:05:46.810> or<00:05:47.280> or<00:05:48.280> finger<00:05:49.240> style<00:05:55.229> this<00:05:56.229> is

playing slap or or finger style this is

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.559 
playing slap or or finger style this is
basically<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.680> a<00:05:56.740> good<00:05:56.830> place<00:05:57.009> for<00:05:57.099> this<00:05:57.189> space

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
basically in a good place for this space

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.730 
basically in a good place for this space
let's<00:05:58.569> play<00:05:58.659> with<00:05:58.779> that<00:05:58.900> distortion<00:05:59.319> again<00:05:59.590> I

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
let's play with that distortion again I

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.080 
let's play with that distortion again I
think<00:06:00.099> it<00:06:00.189> kind<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.400> sounds<00:06:00.610> better<00:06:00.759> when<00:06:00.939> it's

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
think it kind of sounds better when it's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.480 
think it kind of sounds better when it's
in<00:06:01.210> bandpass<00:06:01.719> mode<00:06:02.080> with<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:03.039> little<00:06:03.340> bit<00:06:03.430> of

in bandpass mode with a little bit of

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:22.890 
in bandpass mode with a little bit of

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
the dry signal blended in it almost

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.939 
the dry signal blended in it almost
sounds<00:06:23.259> like<00:06:23.319> a<00:06:24.009> really<00:06:25.919> sort<00:06:26.919> of

sounds like a really sort of

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.850 
sounds like a really sort of
fast-tracking<00:06:27.750> synth<00:06:28.750> effect<00:06:29.409> like<00:06:29.560> a<00:06:29.589> synth

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
fast-tracking synth effect like a synth

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.219 
fast-tracking synth effect like a synth
bass<00:06:30.039> effect<00:06:30.270> except<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.479> because<00:06:31.900> it's<00:06:32.080> not

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
bass effect except that because it's not

bass effect except that because it's not
actually<00:06:32.349> tracking<00:06:32.800> notes<00:06:33.099> it's<00:06:33.279> just<00:06:33.490> adding

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
actually tracking notes it's just adding

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.749 
actually tracking notes it's just adding

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
no sort of you can't trick it like you
