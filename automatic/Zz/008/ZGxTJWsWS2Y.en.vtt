to this control horn using this plastic
piece<00:00:12.150> almost<00:00:13.139> looks<00:00:13.259> like<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:13.679> wheel

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
piece almost looks like a little wheel

serve<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> rod<00:00:18.600> into<00:00:18.869> place<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
serve a rod into place you can get a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
serve a rod into place you can get a
feel<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.520> how<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.820> works<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
feel for how that works this is the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.560 
feel for how that works this is the
elevator<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:23.340> screw<00:00:23.850> goes<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.390> into

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
elevator and the screw goes right into

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
elevator and the screw goes right into
this<00:00:24.750> plastic<00:00:25.320> piece<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> binds

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
this plastic piece that kind of binds

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
this plastic piece that kind of binds
that<00:00:26.699> rod<00:00:26.970> into<00:00:27.180> place<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:28.349> you'll<00:00:28.529> notice

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that rod into place but you'll notice

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
that rod into place but you'll notice
also<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> elevator<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.960> guy<00:00:31.199> has

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
also on the elevator this guy has

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
also on the elevator this guy has
cracked<00:00:31.859> well<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> guess<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.090> has<00:00:33.210> happened

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
cracked well I guess what has happened

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.819 
cracked well I guess what has happened
is<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> I've<00:00:34.020> put<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.530> too<00:00:34.680> much

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
is that I've put a little bit too much

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.400 
is that I've put a little bit too much
pressure<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.610> over<00:00:35.850> time<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.960> tension

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
pressure and then over time that tension

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
pressure and then over time that tension
has<00:00:37.559> caused<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.010> plastic<00:00:38.550> piece<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.149> break

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
has caused this plastic piece to break

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.049 
has caused this plastic piece to break
what<00:00:40.170> I've<00:00:40.260> gone<00:00:40.410> ahead<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.739> done<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.460> printed

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
what I've gone ahead and done I printed

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.720 
what I've gone ahead and done I printed
an<00:00:42.300> identical<00:00:42.870> piece<00:00:43.219> with<00:00:44.219> my<00:00:44.370> makerbot

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
an identical piece with my makerbot

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.600 
an identical piece with my makerbot
replicator<00:00:44.910> 2<00:00:45.629> using<00:00:46.020> PLA<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> I've<00:00:47.340> received

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
replicator 2 using PLA and I've received

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.819 
replicator 2 using PLA and I've received
several<00:00:47.940> questions<00:00:48.210> over<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> past<00:00:49.379> couple

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
several questions over the past couple

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.799 
several questions over the past couple
years<00:00:50.010> asking<00:00:50.879> what's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> durability<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
years asking what's the durability of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.740 
years asking what's the durability of
pla<00:00:52.559> look<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.730> let's<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.390> ahead<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
pla look like so let's go ahead and do a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
pla look like so let's go ahead and do a
comparison<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.550> trusty<00:00:57.059> hammer

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
comparison so I have my trusty hammer

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.799 
comparison so I have my trusty hammer
and<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:57.899> give<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.649> tap<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
and I'll give this just a little tap and

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.770 
and I'll give this just a little tap and
you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> has<00:01:01.850> now<00:01:02.850> shattered<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you can see that has now shattered so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
you can see that has now shattered so
really<00:01:03.989> nothing<00:01:04.199> scientific<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
really nothing scientific about this

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
really nothing scientific about this
test<00:01:05.760> i'm<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:07.470> PLA<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:09.110> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
test i'm just going to this PLA and you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.149 
test i'm just going to this PLA and you
can<00:01:10.260> hear<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:10.830> definitely<00:01:11.390> hitting<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
can hear that I'm definitely hitting it

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
can hear that I'm definitely hitting it
with<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.729> force<00:01:15.119> than<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.600> did<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
with a lot more force than i did this

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410 
with a lot more force than i did this
other<00:01:16.140> piece<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.909> i'm<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> hit<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.240> with

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
other piece and i'm going to hit it with

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.850 
other piece and i'm going to hit it with
a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.869> force<00:01:19.290> than<00:01:19.409> i<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.189> other<00:01:24.860> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
a lot more force than i do the other you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.030 
a lot more force than i do the other you
can<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.220> how<00:01:26.400> durable<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.799> this

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
can see how durable that is and now this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
can see how durable that is and now this
piece<00:01:29.430> isn't<00:01:29.670> actually<00:01:29.970> threaded<00:01:30.689> i<00:01:30.780> made<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
piece isn't actually threaded i made the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.490 
piece isn't actually threaded i made the
whole<00:01:31.290> small<00:01:32.159> enough<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> i<00:01:33.360> could

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
whole small enough just so that i could

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.700 
whole small enough just so that i could
kind<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.560> self<00:01:34.890> tap<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.880> thread<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:36.710> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
kind of self tap and then thread into it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
kind of self tap and then thread into it
and<00:01:37.890> let's<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.759> give<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.180> quick<00:01:39.329> test

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and let's just give this a quick test

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
and let's just give this a quick test
I'm<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> hold<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.350> servo<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.729> have

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
I'm going to hold the servo I don't have

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
I'm going to hold the servo I don't have
it<00:01:42.000> fixed<00:01:42.240> yet<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> hold

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it fixed yet so I'm just going to hold

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.590 
it fixed yet so I'm just going to hold
it<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.560> place

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.120 

so<00:01:47.560> rudder<00:01:47.830> seems<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.460> be<00:01:48.610> working<00:01:48.759> nicely

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so rudder seems to be working nicely

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.230 
so rudder seems to be working nicely
definitely<00:01:51.130> feel<00:01:51.280> much<00:01:51.460> better<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.790> that

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
definitely feel much better about that

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.170 
definitely feel much better about that
control<00:01:52.930> horn<00:01:53.229> piece<00:01:53.740> then<00:01:54.670> using<00:01:55.060> the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
control horn piece then using the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.719 
control horn piece then using the
standard<00:01:55.360> plastic<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.320> came<00:01:56.500> with<00:01:56.729> more

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
standard plastic that it came with more

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.430 
standard plastic that it came with more
durable<00:01:58.479> now<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.900> doesn't<00:01:59.200> need<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.320> be

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
durable now it doesn't need to be

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.859 
durable now it doesn't need to be
incredibly<00:01:59.890> durable<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.790> air<00:02:00.909> just<00:02:01.600> need

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
to have a good hold but I'd hate to have

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.990 
to have a good hold but I'd hate to have
one<00:02:03.750> crack<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.170> lose<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> flap<00:02:06.250> while<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.580> was<00:02:06.850> in

the air now we have our elevator and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.960 
the air now we have our elevator and
I've<00:02:12.970> also<00:02:13.150> printed<00:02:13.810> one<00:02:14.050> for<00:02:14.650> each<00:02:14.800> wing<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I've also printed one for each wing so I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.150 
I've also printed one for each wing so I
have<00:02:16.180> four<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.510> these<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.989> total<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.560> here's<00:02:18.069> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
have four of these in total and here's a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:35.140 
have four of these in total and here's a
quick<00:02:18.459> time<00:02:18.819> lapse<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> print

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.199 

and<00:02:35.689> it<00:02:35.870> took<00:02:36.079> five<00:02:36.439> minutes<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.099> print<00:02:37.459> so

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
and it took five minutes to print so

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.589 
and it took five minutes to print so
pretty<00:02:38.599> basic<00:02:38.840> part<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.650> wanted<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.159> share

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.089 
pretty basic part but I wanted to share
mainly<00:02:41.599> some<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:41.959> durability<00:02:42.379> aspects

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
mainly some of the durability aspects

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.220 
mainly some of the durability aspects
because<00:02:43.400> there's<00:02:44.360> been<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.510> many<00:02:44.750> questions

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230

about<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.709> now<00:02:45.860> like<00:02:46.159> I<00:02:46.280> said<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.610> was

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
about it now like I said that was

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.000 
about it now like I said that was
nothing<00:02:46.879> scientific<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:48.470> throw<00:02:48.680> down<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
nothing scientific to throw down the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.039 
nothing scientific to throw down the
hammer<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.030> definitely<00:02:50.299> feel<00:02:50.510> confident

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
hammer but I definitely feel confident

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.140 
hammer but I definitely feel confident
this<00:02:51.170> will<00:02:51.319> be<00:02:51.470> good<00:02:51.620> enough<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.920> perform<00:02:52.579> well

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
this will be good enough to perform well

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.899 
this will be good enough to perform well
in<00:02:53.180> flight<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.859> hope<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.159> do<00:02:55.280> my<00:02:55.459> penguin
