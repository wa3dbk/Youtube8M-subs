time<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:15.160> not<00:02:15.400> sure<00:02:15.430> he'd<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.270> perfect

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
time but I'm not sure he'd be a perfect

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.650 
time but I'm not sure he'd be a perfect
fit<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.470> situation<00:02:18.100> because<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.120> should

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
fit for the situation because I should

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.350 
fit for the situation because I should
think<00:02:19.810> if<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.050> go<00:02:20.080> back<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.470> look<00:02:20.820> after<00:02:21.820> he

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
think if you go back and look after he

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.510 
think if you go back and look after he
won<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.930> championship<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.860> break<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.280> tie

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
won that championship and break the tie

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.120 
won that championship and break the tie
and<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.600> next<00:02:26.350> year<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.770> Lakers<00:02:27.220> got<00:02:27.520> swept<00:02:28.000> I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and the next year the Lakers got swept I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.890 
and the next year the Lakers got swept I
don't<00:02:30.130> think<00:02:30.220> he<00:02:30.520> had<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.700> same<00:02:31.150> intensity

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
don't think he had the same intensity

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.190 
don't think he had the same intensity
and<00:02:32.290> same<00:02:32.560> energy<00:02:32.980> level<00:02:33.750> where<00:02:34.750> his<00:02:34.900> heart

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and same energy level where his heart

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.930 
and same energy level where his heart
was<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.740> it<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.950> think<00:02:36.040> he<00:02:36.280> want<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.670> break<00:02:36.910> that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
was in it I think he want to break that

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.420 
was in it I think he want to break that
record<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.720> get<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.800> know<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
record and get you get you know with the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.510 
record and get you get you know with the
12<00:02:39.970> 11<00:02:40.300> or<00:02:40.450> 12<00:02:40.690> championship<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.950> everybody

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
12 11 or 12 championship and everybody

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.670 
12 11 or 12 championship and everybody
went<00:02:42.700> crazy<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.270> celebrated<00:02:43.960> but<00:02:44.320> if<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.500> go

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
went crazy and celebrated but if you go

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.040 
went crazy and celebrated but if you go
back<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.160> next<00:02:45.610> year<00:02:46.030> then<00:02:46.630> let<00:02:46.780> me<00:02:46.870> have<00:02:47.020> a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
back that next year then let me have a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.560 
back that next year then let me have a
lot<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.370> issues<00:02:48.370> during<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> regular<00:02:49.360> season

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
lot of issues during the regular season

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.650 
lot of issues during the regular season
then<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> got<00:02:50.740> swept<00:02:51.190> by<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> mouse<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.300> I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
then it got swept by the mouse and I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.420 
then it got swept by the mouse and I
thought<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.990> was<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> bad<00:02:53.380> way<00:02:53.650> fulfill<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.310> go

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
thought it was a bad way fulfill to go

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.760 
thought it was a bad way fulfill to go
out<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:55.000> thought<00:02:55.540> once<00:02:55.960> he<00:02:56.110> accomplished

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
out so I thought once he accomplished

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.500 
out so I thought once he accomplished
that<00:02:56.800> big<00:02:57.220> record<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.700> thought<00:02:57.910> he<00:02:58.000> lost<00:02:58.210> his

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
that big record I thought he lost his

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.870 
that big record I thought he lost his
intensity<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.950> know<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.130> think<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.610> biggest

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
intensity you know I think the biggest

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.540 
intensity you know I think the biggest
decision<00:03:01.480> Lakers<00:03:01.870> got<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.260> make<00:03:02.470> if<00:03:03.280> they're

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
decision Lakers got to make if they're

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.000 
decision Lakers got to make if they're
gonna<00:03:03.730> stay<00:03:04.000> with<00:03:04.270> Bernie<00:03:04.810> or<00:03:05.140> Chuck<00:03:05.440> person

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
you know they were struggling

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.620 
you know they were struggling
offensively<00:04:53.140> they<00:04:53.530> legally<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.100> did<00:04:55.060> right<00:04:55.480> up

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
offensively they legally I did right up

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.820 
offensively they legally I did right up
there<00:04:55.810> at<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.900> top<00:04:55.960> of<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.350> league<00:04:56.560> and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
there at the top of the league and

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.670
