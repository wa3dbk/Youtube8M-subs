00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
now I'm ready to create keyframes for my

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.520 
now I'm ready to create keyframes for my
logo<00:00:07.099> so<00:00:08.099> I've<00:00:08.309> got<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> logo<00:00:08.970> selected<00:00:09.840> my

logo so I've got the logo selected my
key<00:00:10.800> filters<00:00:11.190> set<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> position<00:00:12.150> only

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
key filters set to position only

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.550 
key filters set to position only
currently<00:00:13.050> and<00:00:13.730> I<00:00:14.730> am<00:00:14.850> on<00:00:15.060> frame<00:00:15.630> zero<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.439> my

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
currently and I am on frame zero in my

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.510 
currently and I am on frame zero in my
timeline<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.210> know<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.780> want<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.520> object

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
timeline so I know that I want my object

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.600 
timeline so I know that I want my object
to<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:20.940> this<00:00:21.119> location<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:23.039> end<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
to be at this location at the end of

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.700 
to be at this location at the end of
this<00:00:23.760> little<00:00:24.300> section<00:00:24.690> here<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this little section here I want it to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.100 
this little section here I want it to
take<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> couple<00:00:26.310> seconds<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.180> there<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
take a couple seconds to get in there so

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.950 
take a couple seconds to get in there so
in<00:00:28.260> fact<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.830> move<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.570> time<00:00:30.570> slider

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
in fact I'm going to move my time slider

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.819 
in fact I'm going to move my time slider
down<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.949> two<00:00:32.189> seconds<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.680> that's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
down to two seconds and you see that's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.829 
down to two seconds and you see that's
zero<00:00:35.219> minutes<00:00:35.429> two<00:00:35.789> seconds<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> zero<00:00:36.539> frames

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
zero minutes two seconds of zero frames

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.619 
zero minutes two seconds of zero frames
and<00:00:37.249> I'll<00:00:38.249> create<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> keyframe<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.449> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and I'll create a keyframe for the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.459 
and I'll create a keyframe for the
position<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.589> this<00:00:41.339> point<00:00:41.909> in<00:00:42.030> time<00:00:42.289> to<00:00:43.289> use

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
position at this point in time to use

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290 
position at this point in time to use
set<00:00:43.769> key<00:00:43.979> mode<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:44.429> you'll<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.729> is<00:00:44.999> you'll<00:00:45.179> go

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
set key mode what you'll do is you'll go

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
set key mode what you'll do is you'll go
down<00:00:45.479> here<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> activate<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.530> big<00:00:46.679> button

that<00:00:47.039> says<00:00:47.460> set<00:00:47.729> key<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.889> when<00:00:49.889> that's<00:00:50.010> on

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that says set key and when that's on

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.349 
that says set key and when that's on
you'll<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:52.019> time<00:00:52.589> slider<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.519> is<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
you'll see the time slider here is in

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.719 
you'll see the time slider here is in
bright<00:00:54.899> red<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:56.309> currently<00:00:56.639> active

position key for the selected object at

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.360 
position key for the selected object at
this<00:01:06.450> point<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.140> I'll<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.920> click<00:01:08.190> the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
this point in time I'll just click the

big skeleton key button boom and a
keyframe<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.870> now<00:01:13.020> created<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.740> you'll<00:01:14.550> see

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
keyframe is now created and you'll see

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
keyframe is now created and you'll see
here<00:01:15.000> I've<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.930> red<00:01:16.140> box<00:01:16.440> here

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
here I've got the red box here

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.040 
here I've got the red box here
indicating<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.580> there's<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:17.970> keyframe<00:01:18.390> for

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
indicating that there's a keyframe for

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.190 
indicating that there's a keyframe for
that<00:01:19.170> object<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.220> point<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.610> time<00:01:21.020> if<00:01:22.020> i

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that object at that point in time if i

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350 
that object at that point in time if i
deselect<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.830> object<00:01:23.250> by<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.400> way<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
deselect the object by the way the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
deselect the object by the way the
keyframe<00:01:24.780> does<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.140> appear<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.340> timeline

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
keyframe does not appear so the timeline

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.400 
keyframe does not appear so the timeline
will<00:01:26.970> only<00:01:27.180> show<00:01:27.450> keyframes<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
will only show keyframes for the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.730 
will only show keyframes for the
selected<00:01:28.830> object<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.370> objects<00:01:30.260> I'll<00:01:31.260> reselect

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
selected object or objects I'll reselect

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.150 
selected object or objects I'll reselect
it<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.120> can<00:01:33.120> go<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.510> frame<00:01:34.350> zero<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
it I can go down to frame zero at the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.220 
it I can go down to frame zero at the
beginning<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.770> grab<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.950> move<00:01:38.190> tool<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.230> I'll

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
beginning and grab my move tool and I'll

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.050 
beginning and grab my move tool and I'll
right-click<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.070> top<00:01:41.370> view<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.850> don't

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
right-click in the top view so I don't

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
right-click in the top view so I don't
lose<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.480> selection<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.310> then<00:01:44.310> I'll<00:01:44.460> just

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
lose my selection and then I'll just

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
lose my selection and then I'll just
drag<00:01:44.940> this<00:01:45.120> over<00:01:45.480> in<00:01:45.600> X<00:01:45.840> until<00:01:46.230> it's<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
drag this over in X until it's out of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
drag this over in X until it's out of
the<00:01:46.710> frame<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:48.120> is<00:01:48.270> good<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.720> have

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the frame and this is good that I have

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080 
the frame and this is good that I have
safe<00:01:49.320> frames<00:01:49.560> turned<00:01:50.010> on<00:01:50.190> in<00:01:50.370> my<00:01:50.490> camera<00:01:50.790> view

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
safe frames turned on in my camera view

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
safe frames turned on in my camera view
so<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.170> exactly<00:01:52.620> when<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.130> leaving

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so I can know exactly when it's leaving

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
so I can know exactly when it's leaving
the<00:01:53.490> frame<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.060> wouldn't<00:01:54.780> want<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:54.960> do

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the frame I wouldn't want to do

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.960 
the frame I wouldn't want to do
something<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.470> move<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.250> over<00:01:56.670> here

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
something like move this way over here

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.790 
something like move this way over here
because<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.080> take<00:01:58.260> an<00:01:58.440> awfully

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
because then it would take an awfully

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.219 
because then it would take an awfully
long<00:01:58.979> time<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.229> basically

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
long time to get there and basically

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
long time to get there and basically
this<00:02:01.470> would<00:02:01.620> all<00:02:01.800> be<00:02:01.830> just<00:02:02.220> blank<00:02:02.729> area<00:02:03.240> they

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
this would all be just blank area they

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.640 
this would all be just blank area they
may<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.750> waiting<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.290> something<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.560> happen

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
may be waiting for something to happen

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.920 
may be waiting for something to happen
here<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.400> then<00:02:05.760> it<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:05.940> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.180> zip<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.720> at

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
here and then it would kind of zip in at

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320 
here and then it would kind of zip in at
the<00:02:07.020> last<00:02:07.260> few<00:02:07.470> frames<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.610> what<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> do

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the last few frames so what I want to do

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.869 
the last few frames so what I want to do
here<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.659> I<00:02:10.170> want<00:02:10.769> to<00:02:10.889> move<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.519> so<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
here is I want to move this in so that

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.570 
here is I want to move this in so that
it's<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.170> frame<00:02:13.469> on<00:02:14.569> frame<00:02:15.569> zero

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it's just out of the frame on frame zero

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.950 
it's just out of the frame on frame zero
then<00:02:17.580> I'll<00:02:17.700> click<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.090> big<00:02:18.240> skeleton<00:02:18.750> key

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
then I'll click the big skeleton key

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.410 
then I'll click the big skeleton key
button<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.710> I've<00:02:20.460> created<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:21.000> second

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
button again and I've created a second

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.810 
button again and I've created a second
keyframe<00:02:21.830> for<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.890> position<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.760> object

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
keyframe for the position of that object

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
keyframe for the position of that object
and<00:02:24.450> then<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.680> view<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.250> results<00:02:26.730> I'll<00:02:27.240> exit

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
and then to view the results I'll exit

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.350 
and then to view the results I'll exit
out<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:27.990> set<00:02:28.320> key<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.800> I'll<00:02:29.730> right-click<00:02:29.970> on

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
out of set key and I'll right-click on

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.630 
out of set key and I'll right-click on
my<00:02:30.540> camera<00:02:30.960> viewport<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.590> press<00:02:31.860> play<00:02:34.640> good

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
my camera viewport and press play good

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.310 
my camera viewport and press play good
so<00:02:35.970> I've<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.120> created<00:02:36.660> my<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:37.050> first

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
so I've just created my very first

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.630 
so I've just created my very first
animation<00:02:37.820> using<00:02:38.820> set<00:02:39.390> key<00:02:39.600> mode
