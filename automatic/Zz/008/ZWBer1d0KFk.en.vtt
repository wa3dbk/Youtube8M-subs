00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.780 
it's you've got very clever
so<00:02:35.200> we're<00:02:35.409> going<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> say<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:36.310> only<00:02:36.489> get<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
so we're going to say you only get a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.679 
so we're going to say you only get a
race<00:02:37.200> over<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.379> side<00:02:38.709> then<00:02:39.579> when<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.150> say<00:02:40.450> go

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
race over this side then when I say go

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.119 
race over this side then when I say go
just<00:02:41.109> stand<00:02:41.290> up<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.470> race<00:02:41.650> over<00:02:41.829> that<00:02:41.980> light

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
just stand up the race over that light

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.649 
just stand up the race over that light
go<00:02:44.159> so<00:02:45.159> just<00:02:45.819> won<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.120> well<00:02:46.269> done<00:02:46.419> come<00:02:46.629> back

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
go so just won it well done come back

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.860 
go so just won it well done come back
from<00:02:46.930> down<00:02:47.049> here

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
from down here

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.589 
from down here
so<00:02:49.870> let's<00:02:50.049> go<00:02:50.169> up<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.349> Sochi<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.859> time

more speed things in pairs you can make

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.670 
more speed things in pairs you can make
this<00:03:36.000> one<00:03:37.459> strips<00:03:38.459> down<00:03:38.819> yet

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
this one strips down yet

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.860

weight<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.799> well<00:03:40.889> as<00:03:41.010> part<00:03:41.250> was<00:03:41.849> easy<00:03:41.969> as<00:03:42.359> it

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
weight as well as part was easy as it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.860 
weight as well as part was easy as it
needs<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.109> be<00:03:43.199> all<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.889> going<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.069> do<00:03:44.189> is<00:03:44.870> when

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
needs to be all you going to do is when

needs to be all you going to do is when
I<00:03:45.930> drop<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.169> ball<00:03:46.290> running<00:03:46.829> catch<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.400> think

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
I drop the ball running catch I think

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.610 
I drop the ball running catch I think
it's<00:03:48.209> gonna<00:03:48.299> be<00:03:48.419> a<00:03:48.449> bit<00:03:48.599> too<00:03:48.719> easy<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.199> first

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
it's gonna be a bit too easy to do first

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.089 
it's gonna be a bit too easy to do first
one<00:03:50.329> maybe<00:03:51.329> not<00:03:51.540> okay<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.769> that's<00:03:52.949> quite

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099
