people have been in there playing which

people have been in there playing which
really<00:01:13.430> really<00:01:14.430> refines<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.659> gameplay<00:01:16.140> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
really really refines the gameplay it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.480 
really really refines the gameplay it
was<00:01:20.030> I<00:01:21.229> think<00:01:22.229> halo<00:01:22.470> 2<00:01:22.619> multiplayer<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.310> been

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
was I think halo 2 multiplayer has been

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
was I think halo 2 multiplayer has been
played<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.000> 4<00:01:24.390> million<00:01:25.140> times<00:01:25.490> competing

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
played like 4 million times competing

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.569 
played like 4 million times competing
against<00:01:26.759> yourself<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.390> stressful<00:01:28.490> coming<00:01:29.490> up

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
against yourself is stressful coming up

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.310 
against yourself is stressful coming up
with<00:01:29.850> these<00:01:30.060> scenarios<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.170> play

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
with these scenarios that people play

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
with these scenarios that people play
over<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.799> over<00:01:31.860> again<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.939> how<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.210> we

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
over and over again now how can we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.940 
over and over again now how can we
rethink<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> create<00:01:34.560> something<00:01:34.860> that's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
rethink that and create something that's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.420 
rethink that and create something that's
new<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.280> interesting<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:37.560> started<00:01:38.340> getting

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
new and interesting we started getting

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.500 
new and interesting we started getting
more<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:39.030> asymmetrical<00:01:39.390> Maps

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.330 

we're<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> choke<00:01:43.560> point<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.190> want

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
we're that's a choke point that you want

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.000 
we're that's a choke point that you want
to<00:01:44.430> hold<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.870> think<00:01:46.080> high<00:01:46.230> ground<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.740> an

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
to hold and I think high ground is an

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.570 
to hold and I think high ground is an
example<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.920> some<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.100> specific

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
example of that some of the specific

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.550 
example of that some of the specific
things<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.030> tried<00:01:51.300> out<00:01:51.510> were<00:01:51.990> having<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
things that we tried out were having a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
things that we tried out were having a
wall<00:01:52.800> but<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.580> past<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.270> sort

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
wall but you have to get past that sort

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
wall but you have to get past that sort
of<00:01:54.720> defined<00:01:55.140> whether<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.890> lost<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of defined whether you want to lost the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
of defined whether you want to lost the
game<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.570> stuck<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:58.050> towers<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.830> we

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
game then we stuck some towers and we

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090 
game then we stuck some towers and we
put<00:01:59.700> AI<00:01:59.910> Gunners<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.690> all<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.990> towers<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.980> as

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
put AI Gunners on all the towers so as

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.230 
put AI Gunners on all the towers so as
you're<00:02:02.220> running<00:02:02.400> up<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.730> hill<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you're running up the hill you're just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.810 
you're running up the hill you're just

that's<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> direction<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.230> win<00:02:07.440> we're

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
that's the direction that we win we're

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
like whoa that's way too hard in this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.660 
like whoa that's way too hard in this
version<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.860> wall<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.220> actually

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
version the wall is actually

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.210 
version the wall is actually
perpendicular<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> hill<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.350> in<00:02:13.830> final

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
perpendicular to the hill and in final

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.530 
perpendicular to the hill and in final
version<00:02:14.490> diagram<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.910> wall<00:02:15.240> has<00:02:15.330> been

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
version diagram that wall has been

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.140 
version diagram that wall has been
rotated<00:02:15.780> 45<00:02:16.260> degrees<00:02:16.860> because<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.550> has<00:02:17.820> two

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
rotated 45 degrees because it has two

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
rotated 45 degrees because it has two
turrets<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.080> as<00:02:19.230> well<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.680> turns

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
turrets up here and as well as two turns

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.590 
turrets up here and as well as two turns
in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> other<00:02:20.280> tower<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.940> there's<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.300> lot<00:02:21.480> of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
in the other tower so there's a lot of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.630 
in the other tower so there's a lot of
firepower<00:02:21.990> coming<00:02:22.410> down<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> hill<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
firepower coming down on the hill that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.880 
firepower coming down on the hill that
got<00:02:24.240> all<00:02:24.450> simplified<00:02:25.050> into<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.620> turret

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
got all simplified into one turret

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.010 
got all simplified into one turret
actually<00:02:26.520> right<00:02:26.700> above<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> gate<00:02:27.270> which<00:02:27.690> I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
actually right above the gate which I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.690

the assumptions you made about it like

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.650 
the assumptions you made about it like
oh<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:48.989> people<00:02:49.410> will<00:02:49.560> use<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:49.980> hill<00:02:50.190> for

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
oh I think people will use this hill for

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.270 
oh I think people will use this hill for
sniping<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.560> no<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:52.980> good

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
sniping like and then no one is good

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.729 
sniping like and then no one is good
then<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.239> great<00:02:54.450> comments<00:02:54.959> like<00:02:55.140> this

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
then you get great comments like this

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.540
