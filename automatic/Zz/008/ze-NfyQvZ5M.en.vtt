wings with the I started hinging them

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480 
wings with the I started hinging them
looks<00:01:15.750> good<00:01:16.020> here's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> demonstration<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:17.310> how

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
looks good here's a demonstration of how

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.260 
looks good here's a demonstration of how
the<00:01:17.549> flaps<00:01:17.880> work<00:01:18.180> looks<00:01:18.930> nice<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> cool<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
the flaps work looks nice and cool and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
the flaps work looks nice and cool and
the<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:22.080> picture<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> guts

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the here is a good picture of the guts

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.660 
the here is a good picture of the guts
I'm<00:01:23.909> ready<00:01:24.119> sort<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> landing<00:01:25.080> gear

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
I'm ready sort the landing gear

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.190 
I'm ready sort the landing gear
basically<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.330> power<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> provide<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
basically the power is a provide a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
basically the power is a provide a
basically<00:01:28.680> make<00:01:28.829> two<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.159> each<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.630> kind

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
basically make two of each then you kind

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
basically make two of each then you kind
of<00:01:31.079> saw<00:01:31.320> them<00:01:31.530> together<00:01:31.650> using<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> plan<00:01:32.579> for

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
of saw them together using the plan for

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.080 
of saw them together using the plan for
reference<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:34.320> bend<00:01:34.530> them<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.009> 0.06<00:01:35.729> two

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
reference you bend them out of 0.06 two

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.770 
reference you bend them out of 0.06 two
or<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.570> sixteenth<00:01:38.119> steel<00:01:39.119> music<00:01:39.570> wire<00:01:39.750> around

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
or one sixteenth steel music wire around

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.770 
or one sixteenth steel music wire around
for<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> cam<00:01:43.320> wheel<00:01:43.530> right<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.299> it's<00:01:45.299> point

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
for the cam wheel right here it's point

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.999 
for the cam wheel right here it's point
oh<00:01:46.049> four<00:01:46.799> six<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.430> four<00:01:47.909> seven<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.530> see

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
oh four six or four seven you can see

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
oh four six or four seven you can see
so<00:01:50.490> let's<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.149> start<00:01:51.360> I'll<00:01:51.479> start<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> main

one my dad an idea to wrap the joints
with<00:01:56.640> some<00:01:57.799> steel<00:01:58.799> wire<00:01:59.070> looks<00:01:59.969> lovely<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
with some steel wire looks lovely but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.359 
with some steel wire looks lovely but
when<00:02:01.829> he<00:02:01.920> saw<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.729> worked<00:02:02.969> nicely

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
when he saw it it worked nicely
