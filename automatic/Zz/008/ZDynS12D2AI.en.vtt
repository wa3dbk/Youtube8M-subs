about our education system going on here

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800 
about our education system going on here
in<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.980> US<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.030> could<00:02:14.269> change<00:02:14.510> one<00:02:14.659> thing

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
in the US if you could change one thing

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.869 
in the US if you could change one thing
about<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.409> education<00:02:15.950> system<00:02:15.980> what<00:02:16.640> would<00:02:16.760> it

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
about the education system what would it

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.559 
about the education system what would it
be<00:02:16.909> in<00:02:17.120> life<00:02:17.329> I<00:02:18.230> would<00:02:18.980> probably<00:02:19.159> say<00:02:19.549> I<00:02:19.939> know<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
be in life I would probably say I know a

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.850 
be in life I would probably say I know a
lot<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.840> people<00:02:21.110> probably<00:02:21.260> won't<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.709> but

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
lot of people probably won't like it but

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.520 
lot of people probably won't like it but
I<00:02:22.189> would<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.629> great<00:02:23.870> idea<00:02:24.019> for<00:02:24.470> a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
I would think it's a great idea for a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.670 
I would think it's a great idea for a
school<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.189> be<00:02:25.220> year<00:02:25.610> around<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.500> have

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
school to be year around and just have

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.949 
school to be year around and just have
like<00:02:27.879> month<00:02:28.879> break<00:02:29.209> every<00:02:29.510> now<00:02:29.659> and<00:02:29.870> then

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
like month break every now and then

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.899 
like month break every now and then
because<00:02:30.769> after<00:02:31.129> a<00:02:31.159> while<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.459> take<00:02:31.640> that

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
because after a while you take that

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.280 
because after a while you take that
summer<00:02:32.180> long<00:02:32.420> break<00:02:32.659> for<00:02:32.810> like<00:02:32.900> two<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.140> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
summer long break for like two and a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.930 
summer long break for like two and a
half<00:02:33.440> months<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.220> forget<00:02:34.549> everything

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
half months and you forget everything

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.240 
half months and you forget everything
honestly<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.599> was<00:02:35.720> me<00:02:35.900> every<00:02:36.739> time<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.129> came

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
honestly that was me every time it came

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.759 
honestly that was me every time it came
to<00:02:37.400> summer<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.879> didn't<00:02:38.180> read<00:02:38.989> books<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.560> didn't

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
to summer I didn't read books I didn't

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.039 
to summer I didn't read books I didn't
do<00:02:39.859> anything<00:02:40.189> so<00:02:40.640> honestly<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:41.689> think<00:02:41.900> it'd<00:02:41.959> be

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
do anything so honestly I think it'd be

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.300 
do anything so honestly I think it'd be
better<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:42.440> they<00:02:42.560> just<00:02:42.739> did<00:02:42.920> year-round

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
better if they just did year-round

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.399 
better if they just did year-round
school<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.239> had<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.659> two<00:02:45.230> or<00:02:45.260> three

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
school and just had like two or three

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.849 
school and just had like two or three
week<00:02:45.709> breaks<00:02:46.129> every<00:02:46.609> now<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.940> then<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:48.170> what

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
week breaks every now and then so what

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.069 
week breaks every now and then so what
are<00:02:48.980> your<00:02:49.099> thoughts<00:02:49.400> concerning<00:02:50.329> young

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
are your thoughts concerning young

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.259

people<00:02:51.530> taking<00:02:52.099> leadership<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.940> their

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
people taking leadership in their

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.410 
people taking leadership in their
communities<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.139> cities<00:02:54.430> well<00:02:55.430> somebody<00:02:56.180> has

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
communities and cities well somebody has

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.210

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
to leave somebody has to have a major

to leave somebody has to have a major
voice<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:59.239> what's<00:02:59.900> even<00:03:00.170> better<00:03:00.200> about<00:03:00.560> is

voice and what's even better about is

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.770 
voice and what's even better about is
that<00:03:00.950> people<00:03:01.459> are<00:03:01.670> rallying<00:03:02.030> around<00:03:02.359> those
