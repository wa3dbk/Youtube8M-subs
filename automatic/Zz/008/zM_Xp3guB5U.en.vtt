00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.319
 so about aprilia sr 50 friends and indeed 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.360
 I know with my scooter here 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 it is hoping the last day 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 small problem and always when I 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.169
 but I have already turned it on 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 written 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.220
 I see that approached so you have 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 short signs of life so once heard 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.609
 heard short motor and then yes 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.289
 somehow gone out a few days before 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.159
 he already had how funny are weird 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.720
 behave and so then I was just 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.019
 on the internet informed what it is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.110
 could 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.580
 because I am personally no why now 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 I say I do not know myself now 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.010
 nice rolls off resp 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 I can not wait until recently 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.720
 and then I sat down and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.310
 found out that it was at the carburetor 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.090
 the carburetor was at my 2003 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.920
 years 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.510
 this little piece here so that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.200
 only what is clean because 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.700
 I cleaned it and this video 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.300
 should deal with how to do that 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:08.850
 So ding builds around the carburettor 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.820
 to expand here again you have to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 first time a couple of hoses and abmahn 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.659
 Although the hose here from the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 air filter that's like livestock holding 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.530
 Wiener to seal you can here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.039
 just peel it off a bit 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.469
 I have to replace it but break it up 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.060
 simply deduct each case 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.429
 the second hose in which he also one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.969
 would have to be bit careful is the 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.740
 thing here 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:42.990
 namely going back here directly to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.359
 Tank tops and is the gasoline hose 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 to get a bit stubborn 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.929
 and that's why I want to recommend you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.299
 or so I did that 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.880
 you're welcome to say like that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.869
 better is the hose here 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.670
 cut off because somehow 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.429
 strangely, he just wanted to be here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.499
 not now and then the hose anyway 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.039
 long enough was not a problem for 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:07.049
 just cut me off and the rest 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.450
 gasoline what is in the hose so are one 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.129
 run few milliliter bowl in a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 so do not be to the environment, the 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.390
 stuff is relatively toxic 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.920
 up here you have the gas from the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.209
 Gas tap you have to unscrew 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.840
 beware that a spring in with a 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:31.019
 june to style and be very careful 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.250
 so as not to damage on the other 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.379
 I want to get there first 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.910
 Recommend this cover down to 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.879
 make the screw up here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.950
 release the screw here and the screw 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.940
 down there and the thing just off 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.980
 then you have rather 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.709
 work space because you have to be relatively here 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.810
 You still have to do a lot and you have to go here 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.599
 remove these two cables 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.160
 it is relatively easy and then you have to 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.480
 you can see soon 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.930
 here at the intake manifold here a hexagon 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.019
 06 kantor and on the other 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.000
 side so you see the in the middle of the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.410
 side is just as hexagonal 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.360
 you also have to do it off is it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.790
 a little bit, try the relative 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.379
 So the exhausting to the carburetor 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.150
 expansion is actually these two 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.709
 six dinger may above all, we never 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.980
 stand a little longer already and one 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.889
 a bit rusty then you will 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.930
 you will need a bit longer 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.120
 to expand unnecessary 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.680
 In any case, after the thing out 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.239
 So all screws are built 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.730
 are not taken up here yet 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.410
 just pull off a hose here 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.590
 there is no liquid out there so 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.540
 can you him sakes then 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.190
 The carburetors could just take so 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.569
 and pull out so in the carburetor is 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.519
 maybe a little bit of gasoline left 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.470
 just let it drain in there 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.160
 again in a bowl not in the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.709
 tilt the environment 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.810
 yes and then you have your award 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.940
 expanded and could then 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.590
 clean accordingly for that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.720
 Clean the carburetor is enough 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.639
 tutorials and that's why I leave that alone 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.380
 but personally it's hard for me 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.389
 fallen carburetor because i like 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.859
 I had never done that and I did 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.419
 synonymous do not have a corresponding tutorial 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.270
 found and that's why I have myself 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.430
 thought 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:22.480
 I do that in any case, it runs 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.800
 good piece again I have 70 80 euro 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.320
 saved a repair took at 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.650
 me now as not so experienced 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:40.240
 helicopter four hours with inclusive 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:44.790
 an hour carburetor in here in one 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.020
 Allow benzine to soak in 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.340
 So with the four already relate 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.860
 now on past remove clean up 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.510
 not just expanding it there when you get it 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.100
 maybe once has made five 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.680
 to ten minutes in any case you 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.550
 thank you for watching and hereon me 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.550
 I hope I could distribute you
