00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 well now we have just one bread that 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.919
 nut I think it's from the tanks more 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.840
 acclaimed is one of those who takes one 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.880
 like with your coffee you like dessert 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.769
 stay with the cookie in the afternoon 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 that if it rains that if it does not always rain 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 there is a pretext good excuse for 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 eat a little packet of these good 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.090
 well I want to give in the ingredients for 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.080
 that in house we write down if it is that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.779
 they have to go buy the ingredients 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.539
 that they have certain to go back and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 do it for food they need 180 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.250
 grams of butter that will melt 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 or on time I also like the 5 eggs 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 a cup of sugar a cup of milk a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.890
 scoop of vanilla essence too 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 we will add 2 cups flour 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.829
 wheat a tablespoon of powder for 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.590
 bake we're also going to put 100 grams 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.899
 coarsely chopped pecan icing sugar 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.510
 to sprinkle and also the oven 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.129
 preheated to 180 degrees centigrade and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.059
 in the most traditional temperature of the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.090
 pastry obviously as 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.729
 you are going up or down in height 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 the temperature changes slightly but 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 changes 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.920
 it's like full that good since here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 find the temperature here in our 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.820
 country is a roll but if you can there is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.530
 that lowering the temperature is good 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.050
 so so so so we 're going to do what 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.390
 first the butter haiti 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.680
 will melt is not necessary at temperature 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.600
 environment is super good indeed to me 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.300
 I like it to be more manipulable 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.670
 be more than the square stay like this 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.560
 as you have it to a good 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.250
 controllable temperature that can 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.570
 is cream easily and the rule of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.200
 favorite pastry chef named juana is 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.960
 so two points between more dates plus mounts 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.970
 well that's the rule between more time 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.300
 put to beat you 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.650
 to work your flour more will go up your 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.540
 good pie then and obviously here 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.840
 the checkered then with the times 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.009
 quite counted the east but you 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 in houses leave more 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.280
 Let her read do not know broken a 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.700
 I'm going to fix a drawer of the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.230
 refrigerate and return little third a sopita 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.860
 relax to see and see us continue watching 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.790
 to little not exactly to rest to 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.790
 take an appetite 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.989
 a chela who wants to cheat who 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.480
 I want to cheat you are already 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.610
 burning my butter and how can 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.120
 look piece to see as more cream than 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.890
 butter I'm not fine is normal and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 that's why it's called cream 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.780
 good to this creamy cream now I'm going to 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780
 start 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.970
 let's go throwing the eggs here are 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.840
 5 then there goes the first 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.209
 obviously these are little eggs the light 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.860
 they do not love little eggs there are really 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.380
 me but this does seem like little eggs 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.020
 Light or pobrecito 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.670
 they are tiny chickens 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.670
 little ones like the little one 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.460
 to these 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.700
 where 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.989
 to this one 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.989
 look there you go 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:43.570
 well then another little egg and 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.120
 I go to 209 and soloist and now what 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.940
 I'm going to beat again to go back to 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.650
 incorporate my recipe remember that the 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.480
 Handling blanks can 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.510
 greatly affect the hands so that 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.940
 whenever they manipulate any kind of 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.410
 product had I said nice you saw that 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.420
 barbara pure diction array here this 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.700
 Always try to wash their hands as 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.830
 as soon as possible by that of the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.620
 avian flu and bugs and things 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.510
 I dance and the egg that told me the other 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.880
 day I got to enjoy and with a Twitter 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.660
 that not the egg is not washed as not 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.610
 is going to wash clear that is actually washing 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.270
 it is necessary to wash because today 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.660
 imagine breaking a tile with 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:40.680
 things little by little not 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.660
 well keep on beating I'm going to upload a 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.440
 little bit the speed of this is so that 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.289
 do not break my butter so much and 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.960
 for milk 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.060
 and milk goes 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.539
 I will also add at once the 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.539
 vanilla 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.820
 now the most exquisite part I will 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.890
 turn off my mix a little 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.870
 and I'm going to pay a little bit to my mix and 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.730
 goes to half the flour previously 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.980
 eternity 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.810
 ok it's always half and half point with 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.810
 the villages to bake and throw 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.620
 and I mix soft here because if not 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.639
 as an exploiter 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.790
 this suavecito to go for it 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.689
 incorporating to that I will go adding 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.869
 the rest of the flour 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.149
 now they have a nutritional advice for 

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:36.360
 please say if you want an advice 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:36.360
 nutritional 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:44.330
 how are they trained and so 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.330
 he pays wholemeal flour 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.910
 that does not ruin your recipes as well 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.010
 of rich and yes no 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.020
 the other environmental type a spoon of 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.150
 flaxseed give fiber to your diet 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.090
 and let's give it another pass look what 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.280
 pretty was the most barbarian of pretty 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.740
 nice beard and then what is going to 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.870
 to do now is to recover my walls 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.030
 because there really is flour left in the 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.349
 walls then lowered a little bit my 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.120
 mixture I take to add also the 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:21.430
 nut 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:26.050
 that's where my nut goes and I'm going to take 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.300
 the whipped and then I'm going back here I 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.050
 I have there but if you have a good 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.050
 barbarians 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:41.770
 nothing happened here 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:45.250
 What I recommend is that you 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.250
 just like you call 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.930
 its mold is previously greased for 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.200
 Do not hit them because if you do not 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.910
 truth then dismantling it is a roll 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:01.070
 then what you have to do last 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:04.700
 is we remove the spatula here and go 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:09.320
 to put the mixture 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:11.090
 look at it let's put the mixture here 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.890
 there are people who cool preheat the 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.440
 I really do not laugh 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:18.200
 If you want to preheat the oven, put it on 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.860
 15 minutes before if you want to save 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.140
 the gas is nothing to put it in the oven 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.990
 take it to 180 degrees centigrade by 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.930
 half an hour to 45 minutes depending 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.670
 I repeat the height and your oven and 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.740
 I'm going to teach you 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.740
 how was my delicious park 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.570
 just look at the dessert is a beauty 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.240
 this bread that nutty was sensational 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.070
 but the goalkeeper takes it because cheécate 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.220
 nothing there in casita just look 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:53.050
 that is contest was that delicious is 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.490
 quite easy to eat accompanies 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:08:00.700
 any this drink to little you do not know 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:05.490
 I want a coffee if I mention you if we 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.490
 toss well thanks greatly
