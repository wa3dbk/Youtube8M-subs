00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.400
 currents or 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.560
 finally if you see there are plenty of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.300
 if it's a site specifically for 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.130

 his retirement is the only one where he says what he 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.559
 do not do that we have to do the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.870
 best for memos and for 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.269
 facts but 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.640
 myself if I know very well that the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.490
 deaf they are six are not good for 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.159
 the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.210
 but this dome I would like to have 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.689
 found however galley cabbages without 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.409
 very powerful wire but you have to 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.090
 put the price 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.470
 you are looking for a silk gamer too son 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.399
 so I advise you to watch 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:36.670
 that's the same as the gamer 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.670

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.870
 cg uzel mouse wireless diameter of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.790
 lead to hits and that the rate of 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.180
 refresh in wireless mode and 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.960
 2000 hertz which is also sheer 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.100

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.560

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.070
 converted gt open august 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.250
 here you see the helmets the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:28.440
 best parts thousands sea so that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 goes 1 up to 28 c 50 59 to the good after 1 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.330
 49 here are some stuff like it by 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.569

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.349
 and you see 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.560
 but in any case that there must be 199 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.170

 the best for me to small for us 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.930
 the best 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.260
 here you discover as strict 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.970
 I discovered once and then I 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.640
 find I do not know why I find 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.700
 that would have it for me would be better 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.390
 that it is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.630
 It has a quality and better comfortable td 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:31.180
 better and the sound is better and cons 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.060
 here the bandwidth is better there 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.739
 duration of the helmet is better but we 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.709
 did not feel better my games 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:43.980
 favorite was there they say that me for you 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:48.239
 what is the best placed young paul 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:53.909
 how he's finished the example here he 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:58.240
 is not it if you are here we are the 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.610
 description for example if you 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.000
 Yes 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.580

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.580
 test that pass rugby will see 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.740
 take 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.639
 this single 3 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:24.120
 test start detection run 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.120
 his fangs 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.020
 here he is going to retrieve information 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:37.350
 on your country to see if the if the game 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.430
 is powerful enough for if the pc enough 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.930
 powerful for your game or the opposite 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:50.590
 for example they demonstrate it medic 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.590
 not enough to support this single 3 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.970
 here is line indicates as well as the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.060
 minimum but minimum I can not put 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.020
 his little one there is correct and the greenhouse 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.380
 as in bed she says why it says 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.550
 that it's less skeptical he's going to said 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.040
 what is going well 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:20.020
 he to bones bones the four videos the eye to 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.530
 the recommendation for example game the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.280
 more played 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.280

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.050
 so early 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.050
