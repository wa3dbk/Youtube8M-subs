00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
so much appealing to everyone and it's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
so much appealing to everyone and it's
very<00:03:09.450> very<00:03:09.900> difficult<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.500> compete<00:03:10.950> with

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
very very difficult to compete with

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.640 
very very difficult to compete with
Android<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.940> iOS<00:03:12.150> when<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.200> know<00:03:13.319> they<00:03:13.530> are

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
Android and iOS when you know they are

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.460 
Android and iOS when you know they are
constantly<00:03:14.190> releasing<00:03:14.660> new<00:03:15.660> updates<00:03:16.110> and

constantly releasing new updates and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.710 
constantly releasing new updates and
it's<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.010> popular<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.420> you've<00:03:18.540> got

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
it's just so popular and then you've got

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.259 
it's just so popular and then you've got
BlackBerry<00:03:19.170> OS<00:03:19.380> which<00:03:19.829> only<00:03:20.280> appeals<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
BlackBerry OS which only appeals to a

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.930 
BlackBerry OS which only appeals to a
small<00:03:21.870> number<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.380> people<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.700> aren't

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
small number of people and there aren't

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.090 
small number of people and there aren't
as<00:03:24.000> many<00:03:24.030> games<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.989> apps<00:03:25.200> available<00:03:25.950> on

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
as many games and apps available on

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.280 
as many games and apps available on
their<00:03:26.310> App<00:03:26.459> Store<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.870> brings<00:03:28.019> that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
their App Store so it just brings that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.380 
their App Store so it just brings that
whole<00:03:28.500> fear<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.070> not<00:03:29.250> being<00:03:29.430> able<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.910> use<00:03:30.150> your

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
whole fear of not being able to use your

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.870 
whole fear of not being able to use your
favorite<00:03:30.660> apps<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.440> games<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.760> it's

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
favorite apps and games so I think it's

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.220 
favorite apps and games so I think it's
really<00:03:33.000> good<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.390> Blackberry<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.959> come

beautiful curves and glass here and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.879 
beautiful curves and glass here and
there<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.320> overall<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.500> just<00:04:31.680> looks

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
there and overall it just looks

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.950 
there and overall it just looks

curved<00:04:36.900> edges<00:04:37.229> on<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.860> Venice<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.370> think<00:04:38.880> that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
curved edges on the Venice I think that

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.670 
curved edges on the Venice I think that
would<00:04:39.210> definitely<00:04:39.780> make<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.110> device<00:04:40.380> look

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
would definitely make the device look

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.640 
would definitely make the device look
more<00:04:40.949> appealing<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.550> some<00:04:41.880> people<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
more appealing to some people and the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
first with the whole edge design however

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.080 
first with the whole edge design however
Samsung<00:04:52.080> did<00:04:52.530> pull<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.919> off<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.729> lot<00:04:54.060> of
