if<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:13.990> want<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.230> pick<00:05:14.380> yourself<00:05:14.710> up<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:15.010> pair

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.400 
if you want to pick yourself up a pair
you<00:05:15.520> can<00:05:16.210> definitely<00:05:16.570> squeeze<00:05:17.050> into<00:05:17.230> a<00:05:17.350> size

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
you can definitely squeeze into a size

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.640 
you can definitely squeeze into a size
maybe<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.310> size<00:05:18.940> smaller<00:05:19.300> because<00:05:20.200> they<00:05:20.530> are

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
maybe a size smaller because they are

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.960 
maybe a size smaller because they are
pretty<00:05:20.920> limited<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.430> I<00:05:21.490> don't<00:05:21.640> think<00:05:21.850> you'll

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
pretty limited and I don't think you'll
