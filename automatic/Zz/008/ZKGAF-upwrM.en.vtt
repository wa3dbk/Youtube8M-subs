map of the of the ocean floor and they

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.290 
map of the of the ocean floor and they
we<00:00:47.010> build<00:00:47.339> those<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.730> they're<00:00:47.850> similar<00:00:48.089> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
we build those with they're similar that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
we build those with they're similar that
Sounders<00:00:48.659> ourselves<00:00:49.109> so<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:49.589> take<00:00:49.800> dips<00:00:50.069> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
Sounders ourselves so we take dips and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.099 
Sounders ourselves so we take dips and
they're<00:00:50.789> becoming<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.210> detailed<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.989> or

they're becoming very detailed them or

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.559 
they're becoming very detailed them or
we<00:00:52.199> use<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.609> a<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.059> good<00:00:54.329> look

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
we use them we get a very very good look

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.430
