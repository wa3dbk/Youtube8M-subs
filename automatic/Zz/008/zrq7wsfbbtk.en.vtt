 animated film years many gags as well 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.310
 cool little statements sorry no buck 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.540
 on your story where I myself as 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.850
 adult neat in the cinema 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.080
 driver but it is an animated film where 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.950
 I have to say that you can see that he 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.200
 not the big international one 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 he has budget and above all he is for the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.140
 made small so much like movies 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.940
 the sammys adventure or soon 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.590
 tinkabelle and the pirates it is him 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.000
 no animated film says he is now 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.680
 for big and small, the met 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.570
 whole family was that he is for the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.340
 smaller thought but has a larger one 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.570
 Ranger is the two referenced above 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.459
 completely will say this film is enough 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.510
 already feel up to twelve years 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.830
 the kids are probably fine 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.450
 that means for all mommies 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.440
 uncle aunts whoever with the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.940
 little will go to the cinema 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.830
 the magical home then becomes relative 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.090
 Good job on the spot is funny in 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.500
 the press in front of the area also noticed that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.060
 china just feel good and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.530
 3d especially is always one for her 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 great experience in the cinema because of that 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.340
 quite a niche movie but one of the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.830
 sweet made of it gets that 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450
 magic house of mine as animated film 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.480
 for the little six and a half out of ten 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.209
 possible points which is acceptable 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.280
 but not world class and overall 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.870
 unfortunately only four and a half out of 10 possible 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.980
 points you have has got the feeling 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.320
 three times cinemagoer 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.209
 he is very predictable istanbul 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.480
 just 85 minutes is really longer and 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.159
 is 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.569
 very simple knit also the small one 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.190
 company maybe a little more 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.470
 work at this point and thus through 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.000
 my review to the magical house by 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.200
 the way way, I find that all 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.549
 Well chosen are just the ones 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.590
 main characters so caroline herfurth 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.730
 matthias schweighÃ¶fer almost with am 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.170
 weakest enter the German 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.430
 Synchro verso can watch the movie 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.410
 original on which I believe that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.150
 To be French, that's good 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.829
 more come through in my review 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.090
 the magical hausslers like to take if 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.440
 We'll keep it that if 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.669
 not otherwise the wirtstier gives it 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.949
