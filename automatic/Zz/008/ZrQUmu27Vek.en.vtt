00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and they're really wonderful films but I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.000 
and they're really wonderful films but I
think<00:02:50.019> they're<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.440> little<00:02:50.530> bit<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.799> niche

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
think they're a little bit of niche

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.160 
think they're a little bit of niche
films<00:02:51.459> they<00:02:51.910> go<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.269> certain<00:02:52.510> category<00:02:52.690> they

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
films they go in a certain category they

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.990 
films they go in a certain category they
appeal<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> certain<00:02:54.010> audience<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.760> they

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
appeal to a certain audience and they

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.729 
appeal to a certain audience and they
very<00:02:55.390> clearly<00:02:55.569> seem<00:02:56.319> like<00:02:56.470> they're<00:02:56.590> made

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
very clearly seem like they're made

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.740 
very clearly seem like they're made
outside<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.489> hollywood<00:02:57.879> machine<00:02:58.239> which

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.059 
outside of the hollywood machine which
is<00:02:58.900> great<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.379> that's<00:02:59.500> what's<00:02:59.709> lent<00:02:59.920> them
