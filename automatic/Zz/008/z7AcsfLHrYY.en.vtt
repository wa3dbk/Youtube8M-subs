this<00:00:04.300> all<00:00:04.509> began<00:00:04.810> around<00:00:05.939> 2003<00:00:06.939> when<00:00:07.839> a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
this all began around 2003 when a

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.959 
this all began around 2003 when a
patient<00:00:09.629> came<00:00:10.629> from<00:00:10.750> an<00:00:10.870> outside<00:00:11.170> Hospital

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
patient came from an outside Hospital

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.990 
patient came from an outside Hospital
she<00:00:12.969> was<00:00:13.090> about<00:00:13.299> 41<00:00:14.260> years<00:00:14.469> old<00:00:14.709> and<00:00:15.070> had

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
she was about 41 years old and had

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.480 
she was about 41 years old and had
suffered<00:00:16.240> a<00:00:16.630> stroke<00:00:16.660> called

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
suffered a stroke called

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.960 
suffered a stroke called
locked-in<00:00:18.490> syndrome<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:21.430> is<00:00:21.610> a<00:00:21.640> kind<00:00:21.880> of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
locked-in syndrome and this is a kind of

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.140 
locked-in syndrome and this is a kind of
stroke<00:00:22.270> where<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:23.610> patient<00:00:24.610> is<00:00:24.670> paralyzed

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
stroke where the patient is paralyzed

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.960 
stroke where the patient is paralyzed
from<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.510> nose<00:00:26.220> downwards<00:00:27.220> so<00:00:27.550> essentially

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
from the nose downwards so essentially

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.930 
from the nose downwards so essentially
they<00:00:28.090> can't<00:00:28.330> move<00:00:28.510> any<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.590> their<00:00:29.770> limbs<00:00:30.310> or

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
they can't move any of their limbs or

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.299 
they can't move any of their limbs or
their<00:00:31.420> mouth<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.860> only<00:00:32.980> way<00:00:33.129> they<00:00:33.250> can

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
their mouth and the only way they can

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.189 
their mouth and the only way they can
communicate<00:00:33.579> is<00:00:34.180> by<00:00:34.480> moving<00:00:34.930> their<00:00:35.170> eyes

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
communicate is by moving their eyes

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.580 
communicate is by moving their eyes
traditionally<00:00:36.070> these<00:00:36.160> patients<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:38.350> do

traditionally these patients don't do
well<00:00:38.820> many<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.940> them<00:00:40.090> die<00:00:40.329> a<00:00:40.690> lot<00:00:41.649> of<00:00:41.800> them<00:00:41.920> are

well many of them die a lot of them are
left<00:00:42.430> permanently<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:45.399> that<00:00:45.670> state<00:00:45.970> in<00:00:46.510> this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
left permanently in that state in this

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
locked-in state as it's called so when

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.010 
locked-in state as it's called so when
we<00:00:49.750> discussed<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.760> expected<00:00:52.210> prognosis<00:00:52.600> with

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
we discussed the expected prognosis with

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.620 
we discussed the expected prognosis with
the<00:00:53.410> patient<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:53.950> her<00:00:54.010> family<00:00:54.489> they<00:00:55.210> asked

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
the patient and her family they asked

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.959 
the patient and her family they asked
whether<00:00:55.930> there<00:00:56.140> was<00:00:56.230> anything<00:00:56.530> else<00:00:57.399> that<00:00:57.700> we

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
whether there was anything else that we

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.450 
whether there was anything else that we
could<00:00:58.120> potentially<00:00:58.450> offer<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.739> we<00:01:00.160> explained

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
could potentially offer and we explained

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.520 
could potentially offer and we explained
that<00:01:00.670> there<00:01:01.000> was<00:01:01.120> no<00:01:01.300> specific<00:01:01.840> treatment<00:01:02.500> for

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
that there was no specific treatment for

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
that there was no specific treatment for
locked-in<00:01:03.010> syndrome<00:01:03.070> however<00:01:03.670> there<00:01:04.509> were

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
locked-in syndrome however there were

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.849 
locked-in syndrome however there were
experiments<00:01:07.479> that<00:01:07.869> had<00:01:08.139> been<00:01:08.289> done<00:01:08.439> in<00:01:08.679> the

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
experiments that had been done in the

sildenafil as the chemical name goes did
show<00:01:15.819> promise<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:16.600> had<00:01:16.840> improved<00:01:17.380> the

the period of that first year she made
quite<00:01:25.029> a<00:01:25.060> significant<00:01:25.569> recovery<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.259> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
quite a significant recovery to the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.550 
quite a significant recovery to the

in terms of the mechanism of how this is

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.239 
in terms of the mechanism of how this is
all<00:01:44.950> working<00:01:46.259> based<00:01:47.259> on<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.529> animal<00:01:47.919> research

all working based on the animal research

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.550 
all working based on the animal research
that's<00:01:48.490> been<00:01:48.700> done<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:51.779> Viagra<00:01:52.779> increases<00:01:53.529> a

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
that's been done the Viagra increases a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.489 
that's been done the Viagra increases a
certain<00:01:53.919> chemical<00:01:54.279> in<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.459> body<00:01:54.669> called<00:01:55.499> cgmp

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
certain chemical in the body called cgmp

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.879 
certain chemical in the body called cgmp
which<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.609> short<00:01:57.849> for<00:01:58.289> cyclic<00:01:59.289> quantum

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
which is short for cyclic quantum

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.569 
which is short for cyclic quantum
monophosphate<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:01.319> what<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:02.590> chemical

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
monophosphate and what that chemical

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.519 
monophosphate and what that chemical
appears<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.599> do<00:02:04.719> based<00:02:04.959> on<00:02:05.109> the<00:02:05.229> animal

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
appears to do based on the animal

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.600 
appears to do based on the animal
experiments<00:02:06.189> is<00:02:06.399> increase<00:02:06.999> the<00:02:07.329> number<00:02:07.840> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
experiments is increase the number of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.850 
experiments is increase the number of
neurons<00:02:09.610> which<00:02:10.149> we<00:02:10.869> call<00:02:11.080> neurogenesis

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
neurons which we call neurogenesis

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.840 
neurons which we call neurogenesis
increase<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.240> number<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:14.850> connections

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
increase the number of connections

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.330 
increase the number of connections
between<00:02:16.270> cells<00:02:16.660> cannot

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
between cells cannot

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.270 
between cells cannot
called<00:02:17.489> synaptogenesis<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.170> increased<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
called synaptogenesis and increased the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.360 
called synaptogenesis and increased the
number<00:02:20.519> of<00:02:20.550> blood<00:02:20.730> vessels<00:02:20.790> which<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.690> call

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
number of blood vessels which we call

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.460 
number of blood vessels which we call
angiogenesis<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.330> essentially<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
angiogenesis so essentially it's like a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.030 
angiogenesis so essentially it's like a
rebuilding<00:02:26.129> process<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.540> brain<00:02:28.040> where

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
rebuilding process of the brain where

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.830 
rebuilding process of the brain where
it's<00:02:29.190> growing<00:02:29.610> many<00:02:29.879> more<00:02:30.090> cells<00:02:30.360> than<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
it's growing many more cells than the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's growing many more cells than the
brain<00:02:31.280> could<00:02:32.280> necessarily<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.120> its<00:02:33.269> own

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.339 
brain could necessarily do on its own
and<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.860> relatively<00:02:35.340> new<00:02:35.489> concept<00:02:36.349> 20

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
and this is a relatively new concept 20

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.140 
and this is a relatively new concept 20
years<00:02:37.530> ago<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:38.129> wasn't<00:02:38.459> thought<00:02:38.610> possible

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
years ago it wasn't thought possible

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.759 
years ago it wasn't thought possible
that<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> brain<00:02:39.629> could<00:02:39.900> regenerate<00:02:40.260> itself

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
that the brain could regenerate itself

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.460 
that the brain could regenerate itself
and<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.330> for<00:02:42.569> at<00:02:42.629> least<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.959> decade<00:02:43.110> or<00:02:43.440> so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and we know for at least a decade or so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.160 
and we know for at least a decade or so
that<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.450> true<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.989> brain

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that that is not true that the brain

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.860 
that that is not true that the brain
does<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.650> restorative<00:02:47.310> capacity<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.209> at

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
does have restorative capacity and at

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.289 
does have restorative capacity and at
this<00:02:49.019> point<00:02:49.290> we're<00:02:49.530> trying<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.160> find<00:02:50.760> ways<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
this point we're trying to find ways of

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.870 
this point we're trying to find ways of
trying<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> augment<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.290> process<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.849> a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
trying to augment that process so that a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.809 
trying to augment that process so that a
patient<00:02:54.269> with<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> brain<00:02:54.630> injury<00:02:55.049> can

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
patient with a brain injury can

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.840 
patient with a brain injury can
ultimately<00:02:56.819> make<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> better<00:02:57.360> recovery
