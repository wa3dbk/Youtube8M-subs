 of opinion so today we find ourselves 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 for a new recipe after 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.900

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.719

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 today so we will make a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.900
 duck prevents a hunting recipe 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 still quite start all of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 next by the agglos so for 7 070 cases 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 what are we worth then he will us 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 have a peach duck in syrup 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.940
 so on one side I'm going to use the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.969
 fisheries and I have to keep the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.100
 syrup since it will serve me for the sauce 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.059
 honey to make mumps come back 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 peaches of salt port of pepper 1 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.980
 onion of provence herbs and for 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 brown the duck a month thierry 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.059
 the butter halves we put the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 duck at first adored in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 the fact that we will make it brown on 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.070
 all the little ones the popes it's a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.230
 heading after 10 min 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 so we did 2 lakanal street on 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.270
 all sides I will withdraw since 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:13.430
 the case of a big step of mainsail 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:16.520
 quietly finally me I prefer I 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.310
 am in they reduce and so they do 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.759
 undo them leave enough enough cut 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.189
 grossly well dirty and well not true 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.080
 it was after that we rectify 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.759
 seasoning gradually as its 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:37.320
 link and onions the bust gc I'm 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.840
 a four fire level for his chip 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.650
 of dream by cementing attached from 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.650
 that moment I'm going to cover 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.570
 for about ten or so 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 minutes I returned a little bit the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.610
 duck with onions to be sure 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.149
 that he sleeps nicely and that I'm going 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.259
 to be able to put the syrup of dispatches I 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.119
 pour all over the syrup 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.640
 dispatch because that's what will be the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.289
 base of notes without resources without them 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.850
 fisheries since the rates the peaches I 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.100
 want to bring them back this is where I 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.620
 wanted to bring back honey with 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.230
 a stove next to it and we will actually put 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.360
 it can not around and the dres 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.880
 reassure on the dish or on the plate 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.670
 if served on plate at last 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.910
 moment but at the same time they 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.300
 listen to their morale and that's pretty much 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.400
 20 between 20 30 to 30 minutes on fire 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.050
 medium to medium fire yes and I will cover 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.630
 Okay 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.040
 to just now here for it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.900
 continue to cook we will put now 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.590
 the other element that is important in 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 the recipe that will wear it so I 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.380
 barely put a drink to health 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.510
 m here is me then I also add a 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.820
 little bit of provence herbs because 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.930
 I think it perfumes so I have to 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.239
 about 3 2 3 pinches and now 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.440
 I cover up I let them cook a 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.829
 good twenty minutes 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.880
 okay now i'm going to leave I 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.060
 do not go back the cover for 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.019
 that the sauce starts to reduce a little 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.030
 little agreement 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.239
 and then bah so so here we are watching 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.519
 the cooking can begin the cerro of the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.920
 blow we're going to do we actually go 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.930
 to be able to return the hair on 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.170
 sorry but the peaches in the pan 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.290
 know I put my peaches to brown at the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.290
 stove 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.060
 it seems to me 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.780
 there are people despite dian diallo 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.500
 here is leaving them a little warm and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.990
 we are going to caramelize with honey 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.020
 that gives a taste a sweet mix 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.910
 salty duck that beats that is 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.930
 pleasant 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.090
 at first I will put a 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.530
 soup spoon but we will leave it 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.230
 all this caramelizes slightly but not 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.430
 too much we go back and the mumps of 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.160
 peaches 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.750
 we see that they started trees at 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.650
 caramelize 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.880
 we put back the endorsement do not have too much 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.090
 anyway because after that gives when 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.220
 even a taste a little bit more 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.600
 typed so I think it closes and 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.100
 just caramelize but you do not have to 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.990
 put too much mud after 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.280
 good this the convenience of everyone if 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.380
 some I want to add to them there is 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.390
 mean so here we see that both sides 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.850
 are otherwise you have well because at 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.700
 meditate so we will be able to stop the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.750
 fire under there under the canvas and then I 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.520
 advise you to almost leave aside 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.620
 in the pan and then put them back a 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.530
 little bit to warm a few to 2 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.140
 minutes before serving as an agreement here 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.050
 now cooking seems fine 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.350
 so we will be able to cut the duck and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.800
 after the time to prepare let him 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.570
 in the oven warm walking 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.490
 so that can allow everything to 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.470
 done it's over you look nice to me 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.890
 well, it remains to taste 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.560
 and then to you to make the recipe 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.750
 with what we can accompany this zac 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.090
 with a gratin dauphinois it seems to me 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.860
 perfect good 7 on the site so you 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.140
 can go find it 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.430
 we can also consider with pasta 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.230
 fresh and then if not a gardener of 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.330
 garden vegetables in the EU and me that 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.150
 start 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.009
 how to know no vegetables in his 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.860
 halle advance in the season that can it 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.300
 can be considered hockey well in 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.139
 waiting for the sun because I hope 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.180
