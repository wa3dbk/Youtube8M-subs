00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
don't have that many widgets right now

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
don't have that many widgets right now
you<00:00:40.350> could<00:00:40.500> tell<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.399> fluid<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.059> far<00:00:42.300> as

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you could tell it's very fluid as far as

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.290 
you could tell it's very fluid as far as
its<00:00:42.660> movement<00:00:43.530> tracking<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> our<00:00:44.309> finger<00:00:44.670> very

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
its movement tracking of our finger very

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
its movement tracking of our finger very
nice<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> static<00:00:46.469> wallpaper<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.520> launch

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
nice with a static wallpaper you launch

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
nice with a static wallpaper you launch
a<00:00:47.910> bunch<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> different<00:00:48.270> applications<00:00:48.739> go

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
a bunch of different applications go

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
a bunch of different applications go
through<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> app<00:00:50.850> listing<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.510> let's<00:00:51.840> go

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
through the app listing here let's go

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
through the app listing here let's go
through<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> gallery<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> could<00:00:54.239> tell

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
through to the gallery you could tell

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.959 
through to the gallery you could tell
that<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.260> pretty<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:56.219> quick<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.730> its

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that it is pretty pretty quick with its

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
that it is pretty pretty quick with its
movements<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.870> nice<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.079> fluid

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
movements here so it's nice and fluid

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.310 
movements here so it's nice and fluid
but<00:00:59.070> let's<00:00:59.250> switch<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.320> live

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
but let's switch it up to a live

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
but let's switch it up to a live
wallpaper<00:01:01.620> alone<00:01:02.309> something<00:01:02.789> that's<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
wallpaper alone something that's a

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.509 
wallpaper alone something that's a
little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.359> processor<00:01:04.320> intensive<00:01:04.619> just

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little bit more processor intensive just

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
little bit more processor intensive just
to<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.210> kind<00:01:06.360> results<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> many

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
to see what kind results not that many

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.969 
to see what kind results not that many
here<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.799> I'll<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:07.920> choose<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.820> example

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
here so I'll just choose one for example

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
here so I'll just choose one for example
this<00:01:10.979> isn't<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.030> most<00:01:12.720> process

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
this isn't the the most process

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.039 
this isn't the the most process
processor<00:01:13.890> intensive<00:01:14.299> live<00:01:15.299> wallpaper<00:01:15.810> out

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
processor intensive live wallpaper out

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
processor intensive live wallpaper out
there<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.860> still<00:01:17.009> good<00:01:17.250> fluid<00:01:17.700> rate<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.180> can

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
there it's still good fluid rate you can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.749 
there it's still good fluid rate you can
tell<00:01:18.540> it'll<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.439> hint<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> chopping<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
tell it'll just hint of chopping it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
tell it'll just hint of chopping it's
not<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.090> bad<00:01:21.240> put<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
not that bad put it back to a to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
not that bad put it back to a to
portrait<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:25.140> portrait<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> notice

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
portrait here really portrait you notice

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.800 
portrait here really portrait you notice
just<00:01:26.250> yeah<00:01:26.460> there's<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> slight<00:01:27.180> delay

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
just yeah there's just a slight delay

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
just yeah there's just a slight delay
with<00:01:28.020> its<00:01:28.170> movement<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.549> again<00:01:29.850> that's

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
with its movement here and again that's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
with its movement here and again that's
just<00:01:30.180> typical<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.380> pretty

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
just typical of what we see with pretty

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
just typical of what we see with pretty
much<00:01:32.070> most<00:01:32.400> honeycomb<00:01:33.119> tablets<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.439> let's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
much most honeycomb tablets so let's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.490 
much most honeycomb tablets so let's
bring<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.790> static<00:01:36.509> wallpaper<00:01:36.780> here

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
bring it back to a static wallpaper here

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
bring it back to a static wallpaper here
and<00:01:37.710> bulgur<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> run<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> first

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and bulgur we're going to run the first

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.440 
and bulgur we're going to run the first
benchmark<00:01:39.810> tests<00:01:40.380> being<00:01:41.250> quadrant<00:01:41.909> let's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
benchmark tests being quadrant let's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.300 
benchmark tests being quadrant let's
just<00:01:42.659> run<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.229> we've<00:01:43.350> already<00:01:43.649> ran<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
just run that now we've already ran the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.969 
just run that now we've already ran the
test<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.869> far<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> results

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

nothing really all that impressive
here's<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> test<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.649> ran<00:01:49.860> put<00:01:50.399> up

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
here's one to test that we ran put up

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.030 
here's one to test that we ran put up
score<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> 18<00:01:51.210> 14<00:01:51.930> which<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> running<00:01:52.799> again

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
score of 18 14 which is running again

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to be able to put out again it's just

to be all that star so let's take a look
and<00:02:51.090> see<00:02:51.150> what<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.720> results<00:02:52.290> are<00:02:52.410> here<00:02:52.740> for

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and see what the results are here for

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.670 
and see what the results are here for
this<00:02:53.070> first<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.550> again<00:02:54.360> 1814<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.500> first

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
this first one again 1814 for the first

this first one again 1814 for the first
time<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:56.010> checked<00:02:56.250> out<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.540> we're<00:02:57.780> just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
time we checked out and we're just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.710 
time we checked out and we're just
waiting<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> for<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> set<00:02:58.890> moment<00:02:59.690> make<00:03:00.690> sure

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
waiting it for a set moment make sure

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.980 
waiting it for a set moment make sure
connected<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.620> Internet<00:03:01.950> yep<00:03:02.220> sure<00:03:02.940> are

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.740 

and<00:03:06.990> there<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.040> score<00:03:09.000> 1512

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
and there you go so it is score 1512

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.720 
and there you go so it is score 1512
nothing<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.380> great<00:03:10.590> let's<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.340> run<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.700> a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
nothing that great let's just run in a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.010 
nothing that great let's just run in a
real<00:03:12.090> quick<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.510> see<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:12.960> a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
real quick and see if we get a

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.720 
real quick and see if we get a
consistent<00:03:13.320> scorer<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.010> that's<00:03:14.130> pretty<00:03:14.520> much

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
consistent scorer and that's pretty much

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.120 
consistent scorer and that's pretty much
the<00:03:15.360> not<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.960> know<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.230> figures<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.770> we<00:03:16.980> run

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
the not you know the figures that we run

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.030 
the not you know the figures that we run
into<00:03:17.310> between<00:03:17.730> 1500<00:03:18.540> 1800<00:03:19.200> doesn't<00:03:19.860> break<00:03:20.010> the

galaxy s2 line now break easily into
3000<00:03:27.630> mark<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.440> nothing<00:03:28.590> really<00:03:28.860> all

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130

that<00:03:29.250> impressive<00:03:29.640> but<00:03:30.510> for<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:31.320> know

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
that impressive but for just you know

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.140 
that impressive but for just you know
basic<00:03:31.830> tasks<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.489> more<00:03:32.730> than<00:03:32.820> sufficient

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
basic tasks it's more than sufficient

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.780

quadrant the quadrant benchmark test but

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.880 
quadrant the quadrant benchmark test but
now<00:03:54.390> not<00:03:54.570> as<00:03:54.720> fast<00:03:54.930> as<00:03:55.110> some<00:03:55.200> other<00:03:55.380> tablets

out<00:03:56.010> there<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.090> going<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.239> wrap<00:03:57.450> up<00:03:57.690> here

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
out there so it's going to wrap up here

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.290 
out there so it's going to wrap up here
and<00:04:00.320> here<00:04:01.320> we<00:04:01.410> go<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.640> time<00:04:02.790> around<00:04:03.000> it

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
and here we go so this time around it

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.080 
and here we go so this time around it
puts<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.840> 1850<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.830> again<00:04:05.070> both<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:05.610> early<00:04:05.970> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
puts in 1850 and again both so early and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.390 
puts in 1850 and again both so early and
nothing<00:04:06.390> or<00:04:06.540> nothing<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.110> great<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:08.190> if<00:04:08.370> we

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
nothing or nothing that great so if we

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.240 
nothing or nothing that great so if we
let's<00:04:09.330> go<00:04:09.570> take<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.320> look<00:04:10.440> at<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.769> end<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.040> to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
let's go take a look at the end to to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.390 
let's go take a look at the end to to
benchmark<00:04:11.820> we've<00:04:12.570> ran<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.980> are<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
benchmark we've ran it and here are the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.780 
benchmark we've ran it and here are the
results<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.420> let's<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:15.810> go<00:04:15.989> back<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:17.340> here

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
results so let's just go back so here

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.770 
results so let's just go back so here
are<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:17.970> results<00:04:19.190> now<00:04:20.190> an<00:04:20.880> overall<00:04:21.239> score<00:04:21.419> you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
are the results now an overall score you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.960 
are the results now an overall score you
can<00:04:21.930> tell<00:04:22.080> all<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.410> all<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.890> components<00:04:23.669> of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
can tell all the all the components of

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.909 
can tell all the all the components of
tests<00:04:24.330> here<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.660> gave<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.080> final<00:04:25.590> score<00:04:25.710> of

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
tests here it gave it a final score of

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.390 
tests here it gave it a final score of
58

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
58

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.330 
58
so<00:04:27.940> when<00:04:28.509> we<00:04:28.600> put<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.050> in<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.590> score<00:04:30.070> chart

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
so when we put that in the score chart

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.240 
so when we put that in the score chart
and<00:04:30.610> we<00:04:31.060> compared<00:04:31.509> to<00:04:31.660> some<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:33.100> other

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
and we compared to some of the the other

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.430 
and we compared to some of the the other
other<00:04:33.610> devices<00:04:33.970> out<00:04:34.210> there<00:04:34.240> on<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.660> market<00:04:34.840> to

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
other devices out there on the market to

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.850 
other devices out there on the market to
swipe<00:04:35.800> over<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:37.660> tell<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.050> Asus<00:04:38.560> Transformer

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
swipe over you tell the Asus Transformer

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.600 
swipe over you tell the Asus Transformer
