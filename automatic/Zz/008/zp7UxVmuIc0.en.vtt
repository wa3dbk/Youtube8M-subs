you'll want to do is charge them up and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
you'll want to do is charge them up and
there<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.740> tab<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.369> here

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
there is a little tab right here

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.080 
there is a little tab right here
covering<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.860> micro<00:01:19.860> USB<00:01:20.400> port<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> side

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
covering the micro USB port on the side

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749 
covering the micro USB port on the side
of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> headphones<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.380> find<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.490> hard

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
of the headphones I find this very hard

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
of the headphones I find this very hard
to<00:01:23.970> remove<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.590> owned<00:01:25.710> these

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to remove if it was me and I owned these

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
to remove if it was me and I owned these
I'd<00:01:26.159> probably<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.729> tear<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.180> thing<00:01:27.240> off

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I'd probably just tear this thing off

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
I'd probably just tear this thing off
that<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> fuss<00:01:29.460> with

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that way you don't have to fuss with

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
that way you don't have to fuss with
them<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.210> only<00:01:30.240> good<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
them the only good thing about it is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
them the only good thing about it is
these<00:01:31.530> things<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.890> sweat<00:01:32.250> proof<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
these things are sweat proof so if you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
these things are sweat proof so if you
do<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.600> there<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.619> keep<00:01:34.950> like

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
do have it on there it will keep like

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
do have it on there it will keep like
you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.640> liquid<00:01:36.270> sweat<00:01:36.869> from<00:01:36.990> getting<00:01:37.350> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you know liquid sweat from getting in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
you know liquid sweat from getting in
there<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.579> closed<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.150> way

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
there but when it's closed all the way

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480 
there but when it's closed all the way
like<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.079> find<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:40.650> hard<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> access

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
like that I find it very hard to access

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.940 
like that I find it very hard to access
it<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> had<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> actually<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.950> exacto

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
it I had to actually use a little exacto

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
it I had to actually use a little exacto
knife<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> pry<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> can't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
knife to pry it out you can see I can't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
knife to pry it out you can see I can't
get<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> only

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
get to it now so that's the only

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
get to it now so that's the only
downside<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> charging<00:01:49.350> port<00:01:49.500> being

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
downside to the charging port being

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
downside to the charging port being
sealed<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.180> basically<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
sealed up like that but basically to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
sealed up like that but basically to
charge<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.590> it'll<00:01:52.829> take<00:01:52.979> about<00:01:53.130> two

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
charge these up it'll take about two

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
charge these up it'll take about two
hours<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.869> LED<00:01:55.229> embedded<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
hours there's a little LED embedded in

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.499 
hours there's a little LED embedded in
the<00:01:56.340> power<00:01:56.640> button<00:01:57.060> which<00:01:57.149> we'll<00:01:57.360> talk<00:01:57.450> about

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the power button which we'll talk about

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
the power button which we'll talk about
in<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.930> minute<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.409> behind<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> right

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
in a minute and it's behind that right

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.580 
in a minute and it's behind that right
there<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.000> will<00:02:00.149> glow<00:02:00.420> red<00:02:00.930> while

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
there and that will glow red while

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.289 
there and that will glow red while
charging<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:02.490> turn<00:02:02.729> blue<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.180> it's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
charging and then turn blue when it's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.780 
charging and then turn blue when it's
fully<00:02:03.570> charged<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.829> charge<00:02:05.369> them<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.670> for

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
fully charged so charge them up for

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.219 
fully charged so charge them up for
about<00:02:05.939> two<00:02:06.000> hours<00:02:06.180> you'll<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.840> five

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
about two hours you'll get about five

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.339 
about two hours you'll get about five
hours<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.890> playback<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.759> about<00:02:09.390> 108<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.080> 80

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
hours of playback and about 108 and 80

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.860 
hours of playback and about 108 and 80
hours<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> standby<00:02:11.310> off<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.879> these<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.390> they

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
hours of standby off of these so they

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.250 
hours of standby off of these so they
don't<00:02:13.020> have

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
don't have

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
don't have
longest<00:02:13.709> run<00:02:13.950> time<00:02:14.189> but<00:02:14.489> again<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:14.879> you're

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
longest run time but again if you're

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520 
longest run time but again if you're
using<00:02:15.030> them<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.569> like<00:02:15.689> working<00:02:16.170> out<00:02:16.319> or

something<00:02:16.799> like<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
something like that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.550 
something like that
they<00:02:17.670> should<00:02:17.879> just<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.299> about<00:02:18.390> perfect<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
