00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.379
 I hope you are very well thank you very much 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.829
 for being in another of my videos after 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:16.880
 as you can not hide I hate it if I 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:20.039
 paint the hair as they think clearly 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.560
 no but not for 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 well now if this is true light 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.779
 it paints my hair good now it will be 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.800
 reason to write me a comment 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.800
 can you tell me 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.140
 if you think something like that I prefer that 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.720
 write something like soul you looked better 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.290
 the previous color or can also 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.290
 think 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.090
 he asked me 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.040
 and if you think something like that you can 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.229
 writing soul looks good I liked it 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.509
 much more and with that I already know they said 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.520
 everything I said earlier like this 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.770
 I would really appreciate it if you give me your 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.770
 opinion but do it subtly 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.920
 let's talk about lashes 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.979
 If you have never put them on 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.810
 believe me, it's easy to do it, do not want 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.310
 say that every day we are going to leave 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.399
 with the false eyelash to go to the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.659
 school or to go to work quiet 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.600
 just once when you 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.300
 you want to see different and pretty these are going 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.190
 to be super special allies for 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.560
 us so do not hesitate to use the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.030
 Do not be afraid to wear them if it's the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.159
 first time you put them on you do not 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.750
 worry the joke is to practice not 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.030
 matter they sealed the tab and you have left 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.100
 in the cheek instead of up here but 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.560
 if you put it on your cheek, it would be a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.600
 so much in case lost but if so 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.340
 unless you hit on the crazy and with that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.440
 I am well served so you can 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.730
 keep practicing and I'm sure that 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.760
 you will go super 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.730
 The first thing we have to know is that 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.700
 there are many tabs of different brand 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.090
 of different numbers and very different forms 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.110
 different do not get scared I do not know 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.660
 worry the secret and it is no matter what 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.930
 false eyelash style you want 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.420
 put this is a matter of tastes of the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.430
 all and decide what effect I want to give 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.950
 to my eyelashes I want to give it a look 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.980
 longer or I want to give it one more effect 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.810
 bushy or I almost want to give it effect and 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.790
 that will be super natural 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.190
 this brand is with which I have always 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.860
 I've always worked 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.540
 it's called bliss do not worry if you do not 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.690
 you find this mark they serve you 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.850
 any brand of any price that 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.820
 you like the brand bliss and you know 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.100
 Where can I find you? 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.810
 tell you that the most natural of the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.210
 lists are the 601 the 600 the 601 but 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 you do not have to pay attention to me you have 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.050
 that learn to be an observer then 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.490
 you can see if this is a little bit more 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.850
 bushy 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.300
 this is not so dense has some 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.880
 holes but the best is longer 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.640
 they are for example not very dense if 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.700
 they are fixed has many holes but 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.040
 is much longer decides what effect 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.950
 you have your lashes the shots and those 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 are the ones that we are going to apply 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.490
 to have our eyelashes at hand 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.620
 we should have some small scissors like 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.870
 this and finally we have to have 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.540
 our glue this is the best 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.900
 glue for false eyelashes is 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.410
 called duo and I recommend you use 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.960
 this blue because when it dries this 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.350
 glue becomes transparent there is a 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.630
 duo that is glue in black but if you 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.940
 you're wrong and it's the glue in another 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.370
 side a black spot will appear on the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.160
 grab the one side so they can 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.950
 remove the bow shape that these have 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.280
 eyelashes what we should do is with 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.680
 all the finger take the one down here 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.609
 with a lot of expression and they started 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.530
 take off so easy one takes off one is 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.450
 for the right side and another one for the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.340
 left side when we see that the 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.010
 tab is a little shorter than a 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.560
 side of the other this means that 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.889
 the cortito is going to go in the center of 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.350
 our eyes the false eyelashes are 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.720
 they put after you in Chinese of your 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.800
 eyelashes and after you put them on 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.540
 mascara are put on without putting them 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.480
 absolutely nothing of mascara so that 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.660
 we can remove them and be free 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.850
 of mascara and so you can use them 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.450
 many times more well then with 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.030
 our side mirror let's put the 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.280
 false eyelash like this on laying 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.200
 we are simply going to overcome it for 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.350
 see if we look good from here to 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.720
 principle yes because you should not pass 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.090
 until almost our real tab starts 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.520
 Here, you must also start the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.280
 false eyelash and should also 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.889
 finish where we still have left eyelash 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.379
 and if the false eyelashes on this one 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.860
 you would take your false eyelash from this 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:29.379
 way you are going to cut it approximately 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.210
 the piece that you create the best way 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.849
 to put the glue on your lashes 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.889
 is that the eyelash is 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.289
 turning down if we 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.400
 we put the glue in this way 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:45.400
 it can squirt it can stain me a lot 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.270
 my false eyelash on this part so 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.129
 this way we're not going to put it 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.650
 we have to flip the tab towards 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:56.920
 down and it has to come out like this our 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.140
 glue start it to put well 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.270
 a little bit now what you have to do is 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.450
 wait for the glue has to be 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.820
 almost dry so that as soon as you put it 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.250
 paste in that place is this can tell 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.560
 approximately about 20 seconds and what 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.670
 I'm going to place it remember that it does not matter if 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.160
 you move this move a little 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.450
 it is worth removing it and putting it back on 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.160
 you feel that you stayed on the other side 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.990
 remember that this glue is going to 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.290
 come back transparent so do not have 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.880
 fear let's leave it like this the tab I know 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.760
 that you can notice the difference very well 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.010
 between an eye that has eyelashes and one 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.290
 because it does not have eyelashes really that it 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.360
 see much more cute and rap and say yes 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.150
 I could stick our lashes 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.210
 I send you a kiss and see you 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.210
 very soon in another video of 'la me va 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.850
 to
