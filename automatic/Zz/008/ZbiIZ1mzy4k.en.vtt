okay<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.439> timing<00:00:01.920> chain<00:00:02.280> cover<00:00:02.310> off

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay I have my timing chain cover off

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.849 
okay I have my timing chain cover off
there<00:00:03.959> were<00:00:04.580> four<00:00:05.960> screws<00:00:06.960> up<00:00:07.290> into<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
there were four screws up into the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.549 
there were four screws up into the
bottom<00:00:08.250> from<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> off<00:00:08.790> hand<00:00:09.290> it's<00:00:10.290> real<00:00:10.530> easy

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
bottom from the off hand it's real easy

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.910 
bottom from the off hand it's real easy
not<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.309> realize<00:00:12.059> they're<00:00:12.330> their<00:00:12.620> prize<00:00:13.620> on

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
not to realize they're their prize on

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.670 
not to realize they're their prize on
one<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.160> these<00:00:14.280> things<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> damage<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
one of these things and damage it

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.680 
one of these things and damage it
somebody<00:00:16.680> said<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.460> timing<00:00:18.300> chain<00:00:18.510> was

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
somebody said if you if timing chain was

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.450 
somebody said if you if timing chain was
loose<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.170> he's<00:00:19.350> scrubbing<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> inside

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
loose if he's scrubbing on the inside

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.540 
loose if he's scrubbing on the inside
here<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.810> has<00:00:22.050> been<00:00:22.350> look<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.859> right

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
here and it has been look at that right

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.890 
here and it has been look at that right
there<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.279> having<00:00:26.279> said<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.810> let<00:00:27.810> me<00:00:27.840> show

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
there and having said that let me show

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570 
there and having said that let me show
you<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> loose<00:00:28.470> timing<00:00:28.949> chain<00:00:29.130> looks<00:00:29.369> like

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
you what a loose timing chain looks like

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.479 
you what a loose timing chain looks like
look<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.210> baby<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.070> how<00:00:32.130> much<00:00:32.279> play

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
look at this baby you see how much play

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.750 
look at this baby you see how much play
I<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:34.969> can<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:37.760> it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
I got there can you see that there it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
I got there can you see that there it's
way<00:00:39.180> beyond<00:00:39.600> loose<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> time<00:00:40.649> of

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
way beyond loose that's the time of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.090 
way beyond loose that's the time of
change<00:00:41.239> right<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.440> I'm<00:00:43.440> guessing<00:00:43.800> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
change right there I'm guessing that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.229 
change right there I'm guessing that
chiming<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.579> say<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.910> got<00:00:45.030> about<00:00:45.180> one

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
chiming they say you got about one

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
chiming they say you got about one
hundred<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.660> seventy<00:00:46.289> seven<00:00:46.320> thousand<00:00:47.039> miles

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
hundred and seventy seven thousand miles

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
hundred and seventy seven thousand miles
on<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
on it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
on it
I'm<00:00:47.760> guessing<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> time<00:00:48.450> machine<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:49.079> been

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I'm guessing this time machine has been

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.610 
I'm guessing this time machine has been
in<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> since<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> came<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> factory<00:00:51.620> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
in it since it came from the factory so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
in it since it came from the factory so
now<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.309> need<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:54.090> glad<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> had<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
now what I need is I'm glad I had all it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.600 
now what I need is I'm glad I had all it
because<00:00:55.440> I'm<00:00:55.530> glad<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> found<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.219> time<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
because I'm glad I found this time of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.510 
because I'm glad I found this time of
chain<00:00:56.789> before<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> broke<00:00:58.129> because<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> had

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
chain before it broke because if it had

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.459 
chain before it broke because if it had
broken<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.180> unusual<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> bow<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
broken it's not unusual for the bow to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
broken it's not unusual for the bow to
hit<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> heads<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> got<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> world<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
hit the heads and you got a world of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390 
hit the heads and you got a world of
problems<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.199> instead<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.860> gasket<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
problems so now instead of a gasket I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.219 
problems so now instead of a gasket I
need<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> new<00:01:05.760> timing<00:01:06.030> chain<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> gasket<00:01:06.960> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
need a new timing chain in the gasket so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.770 
need a new timing chain in the gasket so
I'm<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.909> going<00:01:08.909> house<00:01:09.119> make<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.450> phone

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
good mornings work I think it's 10 11

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
good mornings work I think it's 10 11
o'clock<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:19.890> good<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
tore down that clip that gives me the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
tore down that clip that gives me the
rest<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> data<00:01:23.400> make<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.060> arrangements

rest of the data make some arrangements
for<00:01:24.960> getting<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.350> together<00:01:25.530> oh<00:01:25.979> I'll<00:01:26.850> say

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
for getting it back together oh I'll say

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.270 
for getting it back together oh I'll say
this<00:01:27.240> too<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.900> thing<00:01:28.140> ran<00:01:28.380> great<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
this too this thing ran great with that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.260 
this too this thing ran great with that
horrible<00:01:29.850> loose<00:01:31.100> timing<00:01:32.100> chain<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
horrible loose timing chain in there and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
horrible loose timing chain in there and
the<00:01:33.360> timing<00:01:33.720> chain<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> says<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the timing chain is just what it says it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
the timing chain is just what it says it
regulates<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> timing<00:01:36.180> between<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
regulates the timing between the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.789 
regulates the timing between the
camshaft

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
camshaft

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.100 
camshaft
and<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> crankshaft<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> round

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and the crankshaft if it's out of round

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.289 
and the crankshaft if it's out of round
then<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.530> means<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.820> gears<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
then that means that the the gears and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
then that means that the the gears and
things<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.689> mean<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> valves<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.950> Pistons

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
things I mean the valves and the Pistons

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.740 
things I mean the valves and the Pistons
are<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.210> time<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> each

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
are not going to be in time to each

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.800 
are not going to be in time to each
other<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.890> gonna<00:01:47.070> run<00:01:47.369> optimally

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
other it's not gonna run optimally

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.850 
other it's not gonna run optimally
especially<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> chain<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.619> wiggle

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
especially if that chain can wiggle

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
especially if that chain can wiggle
around<00:01:50.340> which<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> does<00:01:50.970> it'll<00:01:51.299> it'll<00:01:51.600> allow

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
around which it does it'll it'll allow

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.679 
around which it does it'll it'll allow
the<00:01:52.310> camshaft<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.579> fluctuate<00:01:54.149> from<00:01:54.360> where<00:01:54.570> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the camshaft to fluctuate from where it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.660 
the camshaft to fluctuate from where it
should<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.920> imagine<00:01:56.100> how<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.549> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
should be so just imagine how good this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
should be so just imagine how good this
thing<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.090> run<00:01:57.270> once<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.899> fixed

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
thing is gonna run once I get that fixed

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.469 
thing is gonna run once I get that fixed
oh<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.950> should<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.549> honking<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
oh that should be just honking just

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.930 
oh that should be just honking just
honking
