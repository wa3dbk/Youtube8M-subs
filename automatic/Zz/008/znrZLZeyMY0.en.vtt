00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
language I think alright so here's the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
language I think alright so here's the
real<00:01:19.080> stuff<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.619> actually<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> tiny

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
real stuff so this actually is a tiny

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
real stuff so this actually is a tiny
camera<00:01:21.150> I'll<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.110> minute<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
camera I'll get that in a minute so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.340 
camera I'll get that in a minute so
here's<00:01:22.770> probably<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.369> charging<00:01:23.939> station

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.020 

well<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.400> connect<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> my

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
well I think this is to connect it to my

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
well I think this is to connect it to my
TV<00:01:30.540> I'm<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.049> sure<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> USB<00:01:34.920> oh<00:01:37.040> no

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
TV I'm not sure about that the USB oh no

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
TV I'm not sure about that the USB oh no
I<00:01:38.070> guess<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> connect<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:39.420> TV

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
I guess this is to connect it to my TV

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.789 
I guess this is to connect it to my TV
so<00:01:39.930> I'm<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.229> sure<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.950> is

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
so I'm not really sure what this is

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.440 
so I'm not really sure what this is
there's<00:01:43.799> fewer<00:01:44.159> cables<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:46.939> more<00:01:47.939> cables
