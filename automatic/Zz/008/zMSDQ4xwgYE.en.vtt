00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
don't we you know reduce even more stuff

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.810 
don't we you know reduce even more stuff
anyways<00:05:21.380> what<00:05:21.560> else<00:05:21.710> is<00:05:21.860> there<00:05:22.009> yeah<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.610> spas

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
are terrible they spawned right behind

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.159 
are terrible they spawned right behind
you<00:05:24.500> on<00:05:24.680> stonehenge<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.360> have<00:05:26.509> a<00:05:26.690> NC<00:05:27.020> and

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
you on stonehenge if you have a NC and

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.749 
you on stonehenge if you have a NC and
they<00:05:27.259> have<00:05:27.409> be<00:05:27.620> they'll<00:05:27.860> spawn<00:05:28.070> right<00:05:28.340> next<00:05:28.639> to

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
they have be they'll spawn right next to

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.850 
they have be they'll spawn right next to
a<00:05:28.789> few<00:05:29.000> inside<00:05:29.539> big<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.229> that's<00:05:30.409> if<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.740> have

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
a few inside big and that's if you have

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.610 
a few inside big and that's if you have
multiple<00:05:31.159> people<00:05:31.639> in<00:05:31.729> there<00:05:31.880> anyways<00:05:32.620> it's

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
multiple people in there anyways it's

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.040 
multiple people in there anyways it's
just<00:05:33.889> so<00:05:34.099> bad<00:05:34.400> I<00:05:34.430> can't<00:05:34.849> stand<00:05:35.240> it<00:05:35.509> this<00:05:35.720> spawns

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
just so bad I can't stand it this spawns

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.320 
just so bad I can't stand it this spawns
in<00:05:36.229> this<00:05:36.380> game<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:37.610> think<00:05:37.819> making<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.180> map

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
in this game you think making a map

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.520 
in this game you think making a map
bigger<00:05:38.569> would<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:39.139> a<00:05:39.169> better<00:05:39.349> effect

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
bigger would have a better effect

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.029 
bigger would have a better effect
honestly<00:05:40.460> no<00:05:40.729> there's<00:05:41.419> no<00:05:41.690> better<00:05:42.259> effect<00:05:42.830> in

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
honestly no there's no better effect in

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.790 
honestly no there's no better effect in
this<00:05:43.190> game<00:05:43.400> than<00:05:43.610> there<00:05:43.759> would<00:05:43.970> be<00:05:44.030> if<00:05:44.800> the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
this game than there would be if the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.589 
this game than there would be if the
maps<00:05:46.009> were<00:05:46.190> smaller<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.909> swans<00:05:47.180> are<00:05:47.330> still

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
maps were smaller the swans are still

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.719 
maps were smaller the swans are still
trash<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.590> maps<00:05:48.800> are<00:05:48.949> trash<00:05:49.220> so<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.490> just

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
trash the maps are trash so you just

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:50.939 
trash the maps are trash so you just
created<00:05:50.000> a<00:05:50.180> double<00:05:50.479> negative<00:05:50.570> which

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
created a double negative which

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.260 
created a double negative which
relatively<00:05:51.949> would<00:05:52.219> be<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.400> positive<00:05:52.610> but<00:05:53.150> it's

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
relatively would be a positive but it's

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.350 
relatively would be a positive but it's
not<00:05:53.650> actually<00:05:54.650> wait<00:05:54.770> i<00:05:55.039> don't<00:05:55.820> know<00:05:55.880> i<00:05:56.030> don't<00:05:56.090> i

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
not actually wait i don't know i don't i

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.610 
not actually wait i don't know i don't i
don't<00:05:56.389> know<00:05:56.599> double<00:05:56.870> negatives<00:05:57.169> in<00:05:57.289> bullshit

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
don't know double negatives in bullshit

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.659 
don't know double negatives in bullshit
like<00:05:57.710> that<00:05:57.740> whatever<00:05:58.130> let's<00:05:58.400> see<00:05:58.520> what<00:05:58.639> else

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
like that whatever let's see what else

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.240 
like that whatever let's see what else
is<00:05:58.909> there<00:05:59.030> support<00:05:59.930> killstreaks<00:06:00.199> i<00:06:00.740> don't<00:06:01.099> i

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
is there support killstreaks i don't i

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
is there support killstreaks i don't i

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.159 
mentioned these before the only thing i
don't<00:06:04.039> agree<00:06:04.190> with<00:06:04.280> will<00:06:04.639> be<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.940> oracle<00:06:05.479> i'm

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
don't agree with will be the oracle i'm

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.260 
don't agree with will be the oracle i'm
pretty<00:06:06.919> sure<00:06:07.009> that's<00:06:07.159> support<00:06:07.520> which<00:06:07.699> it's<00:06:08.090> a

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
pretty sure that's support which it's a

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.700 
pretty sure that's support which it's a
vsat<00:06:08.659> that<00:06:08.840> allows<00:06:09.020> you<00:06:09.199> to<00:06:09.320> see<00:06:09.469> people

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
vsat that allows you to see people

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.219 
vsat that allows you to see people
through<00:06:09.919> walls<00:06:10.159> it's<00:06:11.120> it's<00:06:11.449> not<00:06:11.659> okay<00:06:11.990> it's
