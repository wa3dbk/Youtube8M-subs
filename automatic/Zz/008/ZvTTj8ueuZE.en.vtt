knew as Landers d was most likely gonna

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.859 
knew as Landers d was most likely gonna
be<00:00:29.550> choice<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.300> he<00:00:30.390> had<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.510> only

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
be choice just because he had the only

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
be choice just because he had the only
for<00:00:31.050> hazards<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.800> then<00:00:31.920> he<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> venusaur

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
for hazards and then he had a venusaur

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.370 
for hazards and then he had a venusaur
that<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.120> probably<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.480> gonna<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.899> his<00:00:34.170> um

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that was probably just gonna be his um

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530

offensive<00:00:35.160> pivot<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.790> with<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> let's<00:00:36.360> have

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
offensive pivot so with that let's have

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.090 
offensive pivot so with that let's have
a<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.750> into<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> battle<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.440> I'm<00:00:37.800> gonna<00:00:37.950> get

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
a right into the battle so I'm gonna get

lead with rocks I thought it would be
the<00:00:40.620> fastest<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.129> me<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.579> my

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
now here I have no idea why equipped
Fire<00:01:11.909> Blast<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.600> probably<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
Fire Blast it was probably like the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.600 
Fire Blast it was probably like the
worst<00:01:13.260> player<00:01:13.650> could<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:13.979> made<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
worst player could have made I think I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
worst player could have made I think I
predict<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> substitute<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.479> something<00:01:15.780> but

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
predict the substitute or something but

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.420 
predict the substitute or something but
there<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.530> nothing<00:01:16.770> wrong<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.159> me<00:01:17.280> going

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
there was nothing wrong with me going

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
there was nothing wrong with me going
for<00:01:17.610> our<00:01:17.670> race<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.090> definitely<00:01:18.600> should<00:01:18.750> than

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
for our race are definitely should than

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.570 
for our race are definitely should than
that<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.950> guys<00:01:20.070> saw<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> hidden

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that but as you guys saw the hidden

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
that but as you guys saw the hidden
power<00:01:20.729> flying<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.930> hidden<00:01:22.110> power<00:01:22.320> flying

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
power flying it was hidden power flying

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
power flying it was hidden power flying
cuz<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.220> wasn't<00:01:23.460> super<00:01:23.670> effective<00:01:23.880> or

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
cuz I'm it wasn't super effective or

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
cuz I'm it wasn't super effective or
anything<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.750> no<00:01:24.780> X<00:01:25.020> control<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> perfect

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
anything so no X control is the perfect

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
anything so no X control is the perfect
solution<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> also<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.850> there's<00:01:27.090> no

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
solution to this I also know there's no

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.789 
solution to this I also know there's no
way<00:01:27.630> he's<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:27.900> chance<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.500> Focus

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
way he's gonna chance it with Focus

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
way he's gonna chance it with Focus

damage I needed and what's even better

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.670 
damage I needed and what's even better
is<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.720> he<00:02:16.930> briefed<00:02:17.110> actually<00:02:17.470> not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
is that he briefed actually not

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160 
me into Gyarados this is not good
actually<00:02:21.489> because<00:02:22.090> if<00:02:22.300> he<00:02:22.540> had<00:02:22.629> T<00:02:22.810> wave<00:02:22.989> I'm

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
not trying to get paralyzed so he gets

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.869 
not trying to get paralyzed so he gets
his<00:02:25.780> stall<00:02:26.560> dark<00:02:26.739> zone<00:02:26.890> but<00:02:27.340> as<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.550> guys<00:02:27.670> saw

these<00:02:59.260> stone<00:02:59.440> age<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.769> not<00:02:59.920> worth<00:03:00.129> risking

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
these stone age it's not worth risking

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.490

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
not that big of a deal so he's gonna go

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.949 
not that big of a deal so he's gonna go
through<00:03:20.530> his<00:03:20.920> mega<00:03:21.340> evolution<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:22.810> just

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
through his mega evolution and I'm just

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.180 
through his mega evolution and I'm just
doing<00:03:23.079> hopefully<00:03:23.200> T<00:03:23.470> wave<00:03:23.680> because<00:03:24.040> it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
doing hopefully T wave because it's

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.199 
doing hopefully T wave because it's
literally<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.519> only<00:03:24.639> thing<00:03:24.819> i<00:03:24.880> can<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.180> I

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
literally the only thing i can do I

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.490 
literally the only thing i can do I
don't<00:03:25.450> want<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.720> switch<00:03:25.840> anything<00:03:26.200> into<00:03:26.410> this

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
don't want to switch anything into this

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.319 
don't want to switch anything into this
either<00:03:26.709> because<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.730> only<00:03:27.850> thing<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.120> only

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
either because the only thing I can only

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.759 
either because the only thing I can only
switch<00:03:28.540> into<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> sludge<00:03:29.019> bomb<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.349> Garchomp

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
switch into a sludge bomb is Garchomp

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.319 
switch into a sludge bomb is Garchomp
which<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.250> don't<00:03:30.310> know<00:03:30.430> if<00:03:30.489> it'll<00:03:30.670> ever<00:03:30.819> not<00:03:31.090> um

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
which I don't know if it'll ever not um

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.479 
which I don't know if it'll ever not um
if<00:03:31.780> he<00:03:31.930> gets<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.170> poison<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.709> X<00:03:33.160> control

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
if he gets the poison and X control

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.589 
if he gets the poison and X control
which<00:03:33.579> can't<00:03:33.760> really<00:03:33.940> touch<00:03:34.060> him<00:03:34.209> back<00:03:34.359> but<00:03:34.510> he

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
which can't really touch him back but he

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.360 
which can't really touch him back but he
goes<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:34.870> sludge<00:03:35.049> mom<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.380> die<00:03:35.440> now<00:03:35.950> I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
goes for sludge mom and I die now I

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.860 
goes for sludge mom and I die now I
thought<00:03:36.760> maybe<00:03:36.970> he<00:03:37.150> was<00:03:37.239> off<00:03:37.389> friends<00:03:37.630> adjust

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
thought maybe he was off friends adjust

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.000

was<00:06:21.760> kind<00:06:21.910> of<00:06:22.060> risky<00:06:22.300> so<00:06:22.420> Meg<00:06:22.600> evolving<00:06:22.990> wasn't

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
was kind of risky so Meg evolving wasn't

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.600 
was kind of risky so Meg evolving wasn't
that<00:06:23.320> like<00:06:23.500> not<00:06:23.680> Meg<00:06:23.890> evolving<00:06:24.250> wasn't<00:06:24.460> a<00:06:24.490> bad

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
that like not Meg evolving wasn't a bad

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.940 
that like not Meg evolving wasn't a bad
