swiveling tweeter mr. power reference
got<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> little<00:00:25.680> transformer<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.430> something

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
got a little transformer or something

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
got a little transformer or something
I'm<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:26.939> exactly<00:00:27.420> sure<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:28.680> that's

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
I'm not exactly sure what that's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.429 
I'm not exactly sure what that's
actually<00:00:29.130> cold<00:00:30.080> transistor<00:00:31.080> or<00:00:31.199> something

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
actually cold transistor or something

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
actually cold transistor or something
like<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.920> separate<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> highs<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
like that to separate the highs and the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.170 
like that to separate the highs and the
mids<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.980> I<00:00:35.480> do<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> quick<00:00:37.850> do<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> quick

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
mids and I do it quick do a quick

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.580 
mids and I do it quick do a quick
demonstration<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.350> excursion<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
demonstration of the excursion and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.420 
demonstration of the excursion and
clarity<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.309> stuff<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:01.370 

let<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> station<00:00:54.090> better

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:02:07.000

this<00:02:08.010> size<00:02:08.369> magnet<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.840> sizing

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
this size magnet you know so sizing

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.000 
this size magnet you know so sizing
person<00:02:10.590> next<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.130> Xbox<00:02:11.580> 360<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.210> thickness

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
person next to an Xbox 360 in thickness

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
person next to an Xbox 360 in thickness
it's<00:02:14.010> probably<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.420> when<00:02:15.420> prob<00:02:15.960> about<00:02:15.990> two

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
it's probably about when prob about two

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430 
it's probably about when prob about two
and<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.410> half<00:02:16.560> inches<00:02:16.890> depth<00:02:17.900> tweeter<00:02:18.900> gets

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and a half inches depth tweeter gets

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.520 
and a half inches depth tweeter gets
really<00:02:19.709> loud<00:02:19.830> actually<00:02:20.280> had<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.490> treble<00:02:20.790> down

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
really loud actually had the treble down

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.230 
really loud actually had the treble down
so<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.800> wasn't<00:02:23.100> even<00:02:23.459> close<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.910> all<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> way

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
so it wasn't even close to all the way

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.240 
so it wasn't even close to all the way
up<00:02:25.400> very<00:02:26.400> loud<00:02:26.610> speakers<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:28.380> would<00:02:28.890> definitely

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
up very loud speakers I would definitely

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.920 
up very loud speakers I would definitely
recommend<00:02:29.370> them<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.060> you're<00:02:30.420> thinking<00:02:30.780> about

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
recommend them if you're thinking about

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.840 
recommend them if you're thinking about
getting<00:02:31.170> them<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.620> those<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.489> actually<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
getting them that those are actually the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.890 
getting them that those are actually the
series<00:02:33.630> or<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.459> year<00:02:35.700> model<00:02:35.970> there<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
series or the the year model there the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.190 
series or the the year model there the
second<00:02:37.890> newest<00:02:38.160> ones<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.520> newest<00:02:38.790> ones<00:02:39.000> out

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
second newest ones the newest ones out

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.990 
second newest ones the newest ones out
aren't<00:02:40.200> they<00:02:40.380> don't<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.890> orange<00:02:41.700> color

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
aren't they don't have the orange color

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500 
aren't they don't have the orange color
Baima<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.020> black<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
Baima on the back it's just black and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
Baima on the back it's just black and
the<00:02:45.510> white<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.230> these<00:02:46.440> things<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.950> black

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the white on these things is black

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.009 
the white on these things is black
instead<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.610> white<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.180> they're<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.989> ones

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
instead of white so they're the ones

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.960 
instead of white so they're the ones
right<00:02:49.320> before<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.160> they<00:02:50.340> still<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:50.730> sell

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
right before them but they still do sell

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.620 
right before them but they still do sell
them<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.500> pick<00:02:52.650> them<00:02:52.800> up<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
them and you can pick them up for I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.060 
them and you can pick them up for I
believe<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.050> found<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.650> about<00:02:55.830> under

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
believe that I found it for about under

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.520 
believe that I found it for about under
$100<00:02:56.670> for<00:02:56.970> them<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.840> set<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.170> six<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
$100 for them for set of six and a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.790 
$100 for them for set of six and a
half's<00:02:58.709> they're<00:03:00.080> definitely<00:03:01.080> loud<00:03:01.230> I've<00:03:01.620> got

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
half's they're definitely loud I've got

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.229 
half's they're definitely loud I've got
I've<00:03:01.980> got<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.519> truck<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:02.730> cuz

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
I've got one in the truck now cuz

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.820 
I've got one in the truck now cuz
they're<00:03:03.480> they're<00:03:04.230> an<00:03:04.380> oversize

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
they're they're an oversize

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.580 
they're they're an oversize
six-and-a-half<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:05.820> don't<00:03:06.000> fit<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.590> 100%

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
six-and-a-half so they don't fit a 100%

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.949 
six-and-a-half so they don't fit a 100%
perfect<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.269> regular<00:03:09.570> six<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> half

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
perfect in in a regular six and a half

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.479 
perfect in in a regular six and a half
spot<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:11.300> yeah<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.130> kind<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.459> a

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
spot so yeah so kind of have to do a

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.000 
spot so yeah so kind of have to do a
little<00:03:14.640> modification<00:03:14.880> but<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:16.680> worth<00:03:16.860> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
little modification but it's worth it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.000 
little modification but it's worth it
cuz<00:03:17.190> they're<00:03:17.340> nice<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.530> that's<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.709> Memphis

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
six and a half's thinking about getting

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.690 
six and a half's thinking about getting
them<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.989> would<00:03:22.170> definitely<00:03:22.650> go<00:03:22.890> with<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.220> and
