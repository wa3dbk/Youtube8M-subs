00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.370
 beautiful all girls so rediscovered with 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.080
 a new video 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 today I'll show you a little unboxing 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.620
 particular 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.810
 it is not a question of video games but of the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.300
 my new pig that I bought myself 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.890
 yes I decided to buy you a boy 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.410
 new laptop since the old one 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.450
 it's not that it wasn't good because it was 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.540
 good but boh was giving problems and 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.380
 so we passed immediately to the new 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.059
 let's proceed with the unboxing 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.980
 features to illustrate later but 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.980
 it's a real pig boy 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.700
 this is what he deserves 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 I do not speak it only with myself but then 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.790
 let's focus on a piece of paper instead 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 he is this technician to the rescue certainly 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:51.280
 hi charger interest out a lot 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.690
 heavy 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.310
 we hope that from now closely dear 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:03.130
 open it to understand it burns not too much 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:04.869
 of battery-powered months 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.050
 even this one needs little 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:15.150
 because in the other hp that goes there too 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:15.150
 it burned immediately anyway now 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.370
 dealer who still drives 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.540
 senseless initiators he therefore should 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 be ready for use 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.260
 regarding the features e 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.560

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.590

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.579

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.370

 because I do n't judge pc games a little 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.890
 I think it's a bomb if you go back to the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.500
 my tg 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:26.090

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.080
 computer left as water as le 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.970
 candies but evenings trade people out 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:46.490

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.000
 therefore they are still connected to the internet 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:51.639
 I don't know I can't lose that much 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.270
 snapfish we also always see stuff of 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.759
 internet is well classic games 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.220
 things, however, are about six years that he buys 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:08.110
 Initiation level leaders are all 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:11.100

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:22.229

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.190
 in short, boys is a beautiful one 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.030
 story 2 gb video card dedicated but 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.800

 I will then let you know after using 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.560

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.210
 shot euronics mediaworld this is the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.130
 the best 48 ever is 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.039
 some, however, we say exceeded 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.960
 one thousand euro subscriptions so let's say 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.120
 engine the euro this in my opinion the 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.880
 better enjoyment than the apple 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.979
 although it is one of her apple facts 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.240
 iphone courses that start from that of 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.150
 I don't like laptops 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.370
 so opted for this guy the 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.500
