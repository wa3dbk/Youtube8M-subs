00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 academy in a band that I'm not going to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.429
 start doing this for now I'll go 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 record here giving an account of my 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.399
 walk to maromba galera one thing i 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.520
 I tell you what is being harder to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.360
 me is the power of waking up is the fact 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.950
 to get out of bed leave the house 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 get out of comfort to go pull iron and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.699
 do half an hour of treadmill half an hour 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.420
 bike and stuff and you know you have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.500
 what to do 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 It's no use in my case and I let it go. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 getting fat beyond color does not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.369
 I'll get there and pull chafe 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.659
 I 'm going to get a big chest arm but 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.000
 I'll get rich 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.760
 so I'm going to pull iron or 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.220
 stay strong but at the same time I go 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.900
 gain lean mass only on then either 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 lose the fat so I'll do 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.890
 leg exercises or doing is biking 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.710
 I'll do the treadmill and to share 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.640
 that what I'm feeling difficult 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640
 it is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 expensive food just because the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.560
 following should the two years so I ate 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.250
 all I wanted was linked to Coca Cola 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.390
 fucking pizza franguinho the hamburg 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.220
 and everything I want as and I go 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.430
 Having to deprive myself of this I have to 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.830
 deprive it and sometimes I play grass 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.470
 I'm willing and in a way to say yes 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.420
 Fuck, I will not be doing this because 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.880
 otherwise I will not work 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.740
 and eat a son of a bitch then it's this 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.740
 lesser difficulty is the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.050
 food is too fucking fucking 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.179
 but this is also the custom to see from here 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.730
 I'll cut down on my food a little 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.660
 stomach becomes less dilated 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.430
 and so I will improve then as 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.400
 this series that is for you also 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.540
 motivate me to do that, tell me there you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.090
 short 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.209
 which is the difficulty of you you are 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.700
 discouraged because I already told you 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.280
 If it's not bigger, let's play ball. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.100
 of the hour and still can not see difference 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.720

 I'm eating less than I was eating and I'm going 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.500
