Yin<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:09.139> often<00:00:10.139> get<00:00:10.889> asked<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:12.119> gum<00:00:12.600> paste

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
Yin I often get asked about gum paste

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.400 
Yin I often get asked about gum paste
and<00:00:13.170> fondant<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.180> decided<00:00:15.959> to<00:00:16.110> make<00:00:16.289> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
and fondant so I decided to make this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.730 
and fondant so I decided to make this
short<00:00:16.470> clip<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:17.610> talk<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:18.230> gum<00:00:19.230> paste<00:00:19.440> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
short clip to talk about gum paste and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.170 
short clip to talk about gum paste and
fondant<00:00:21.950> again<00:00:22.950> like<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.460> told<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.790> my<00:00:23.850> previous

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
fondant again like I told in my previous

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.770 
fondant again like I told in my previous
video<00:00:24.540> I<00:00:24.720> usually<00:00:25.410> buy<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.780> because

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
video I usually buy them just because

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.110 
video I usually buy them just because
it's<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:29.600> predictable<00:00:31.579> compared<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.910> making

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
it's more predictable compared to making

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.090 
it's more predictable compared to making
my<00:00:33.449> own<00:00:35.060> when<00:00:36.060> I<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.750> own

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
my own when I try to make my own

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.240 
my own when I try to make my own
marshmallow<00:00:38.100> fondant<00:00:38.310> I<00:00:38.730> saw<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:40.130> every<00:00:41.130> now

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
marshmallow fondant I saw that every now

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
marshmallow fondant I saw that every now
and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.520> I'd<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:43.100> powdered<00:00:44.100> sugar<00:00:44.450> bits<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and then I'd see powdered sugar bits in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
and then I'd see powdered sugar bits in
it<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.739> weren't<00:00:47.579> dissolve<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:49.550> anyway<00:00:50.550> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it that weren't dissolve so anyway this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.440 
it that weren't dissolve so anyway this
is<00:00:51.059> gum<00:00:51.450> paste<00:00:51.710> comes<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> white<00:00:53.450> fondant

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
is gum paste comes in white fondant

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.920 
is gum paste comes in white fondant
comes<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.079> an<00:00:55.290> assortment<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.309> colors<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.969> when

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
comes in an assortment of colors so when

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.200 
comes in an assortment of colors so when
you<00:00:58.020> take<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.399> tubs<00:00:59.730> these<00:01:00.090> are

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you take them out of the tubs these are

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.900 
you take them out of the tubs these are
2<00:01:00.360> pound<00:01:00.690> tubs<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:02.250> pretty<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.670> look

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
2 pound tubs they pretty much look

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.199 
2 pound tubs they pretty much look
identical<00:01:06.799> even<00:01:07.799> though<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.429> mean<00:01:08.609> how<00:01:08.729> hard<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
identical even though I mean how hard it

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:12.760 
identical even though I mean how hard it
is<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.189> pretty<00:01:11.189> much<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.579> same<00:01:11.789> so<00:01:12.600> I

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
is right now pretty much the same so I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.949 
is right now pretty much the same so I
previously<00:01:13.770> needed<00:01:14.189> 2<00:01:14.850> pieces<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.659> gum<00:01:15.929> paste

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
previously needed 2 pieces of gum paste

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.789 
previously needed 2 pieces of gum paste
and<00:01:16.319> fondant<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:18.240> give<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> an<00:01:18.810> idea<00:01:18.959> on<00:01:19.259> what

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and fondant to give you an idea on what

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.779 
and fondant to give you an idea on what
the<00:01:20.310> difference<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.469> it's<00:01:22.469> pretty<00:01:23.429> difficult

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
the difference is it's pretty difficult

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.739 
the difference is it's pretty difficult
to<00:01:24.149> describe<00:01:24.539> it<00:01:24.840> um<00:01:26.179> when<00:01:27.179> I'm<00:01:27.270> answering<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
to describe it um when I'm answering the

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.889 
to describe it um when I'm answering the
emails<00:01:28.139> and<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.679> think<00:01:28.889> the<00:01:29.009> best<00:01:29.509> way<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.779> you

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
emails and I think the best way for you

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.359 
emails and I think the best way for you
to<00:01:30.929> know<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.319> difference<00:01:31.679> is<00:01:31.829> actually<00:01:31.979> buy

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to know the difference is actually buy

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.239 
to know the difference is actually buy
them<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:32.969> feel<00:01:33.389> them<00:01:34.099> but<00:01:35.099> I'm

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
them and actually feel them but I'm

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.870 
them and actually feel them but I'm
hoping<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.119> could<00:01:36.509> at<00:01:37.139> least<00:01:37.849> give<00:01:38.849> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
hoping that this could at least give you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.139 
hoping that this could at least give you
guys<00:01:39.119> an<00:01:39.329> idea<00:01:39.529> one<00:01:40.529> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> differences<00:01:41.310> this

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
guys an idea one of the differences this

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.859 
guys an idea one of the differences this
is<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:43.939> would<00:01:44.939> say<00:01:45.119> gum<00:01:45.329> paste<00:01:45.509> will<00:01:45.719> be<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
is I would say gum paste will be a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.760 
is I would say gum paste will be a
little<00:01:46.079> more<00:01:46.200> firmer

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
little more firmer

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.699 
little more firmer
once<00:01:47.130> you've<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.729> needed<00:01:48.119> them<00:01:48.569> in<00:01:48.840> so

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
once you've really needed them in so

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.510 
once you've really needed them in so
when<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.639> look<00:01:50.789> at<00:01:50.969> it<00:01:51.119> fondant<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.169> soft<00:01:52.529> gum

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
when you look at it fondant is soft gum

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.019 
when you look at it fondant is soft gum
paste<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.999> a<00:01:54.029> little<00:01:54.359> firm<00:01:54.630> takes<00:01:55.700> takes<00:01:56.700> more

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
paste is a little firm takes takes more

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:01.909 
paste is a little firm takes takes more
pressure<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:59.599> with<00:02:00.599> fondant<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.709> try

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:01.919 
pressure and with fondant when you try

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:06.700 
pressure and with fondant when you try
to<00:02:01.979> separate<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.900 

it<00:02:07.130> does<00:02:07.370> that<00:02:08.470> with<00:02:09.470> gum<00:02:09.740> paste<00:02:09.979> if<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.759> have

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
it does that with gum paste if you have

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.140 
it does that with gum paste if you have
already<00:02:11.120> needed<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.840> really<00:02:12.319> well<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.910> try<00:02:14.090> to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
already needed it really well you try to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.140 
already needed it really well you try to
pinch<00:02:14.450> off<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> ball<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.850> when<00:02:19.850> you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
pinch off a ball that's it so when you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.940 
pinch off a ball that's it so when you
try<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.630> make<00:02:20.930> figures

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
try to make figures

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.809 
try to make figures
I<00:02:22.390> would<00:02:23.390> prefer<00:02:23.630> using<00:02:24.140> gum<00:02:24.350> paste<00:02:24.819> compared

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
I would prefer using gum paste compared

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.360 
I would prefer using gum paste compared
to<00:02:25.910> fondant<00:02:26.390> because<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.319> will<00:02:27.590> hold<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
to fondant because it will hold the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.920 
to fondant because it will hold the
shape<00:02:28.400> for<00:02:29.000> example<00:02:29.360> when<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.569> making<00:02:29.870> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
shape for example when you're making a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.710 
shape for example when you're making a
ball<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:31.580> will<00:02:31.790> pretty<00:02:32.030> much<00:02:32.239> hold<00:02:32.569> that

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
ball this will pretty much hold that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.960 
ball this will pretty much hold that
shape<00:02:34.959> when<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.050> leave<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.380> there<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:36.970> opposed

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
shape when you leave it there as opposed

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.560 
shape when you leave it there as opposed
to<00:02:38.030> find<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.680> especially<00:02:40.120> freshly<00:02:41.120> needed

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
to find it especially freshly needed

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.030 
to find it especially freshly needed
fondant<00:02:42.019> because<00:02:42.200> when<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.440> leave<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.860> you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
fondant because when you leave it you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 
fondant because when you leave it you
know<00:02:43.160> after<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> couple<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.820> minutes<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:45.019> won't

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
know after a couple of minutes it won't
