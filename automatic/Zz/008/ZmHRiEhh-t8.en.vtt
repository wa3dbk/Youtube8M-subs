everything<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.360> bow<00:01:36.509> everything

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
everything and just the bow everything

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
everything and just the bow everything
makes<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.350> little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.740> different<00:01:38.100> than

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
makes them a little bit different than

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.010 
makes them a little bit different than
like<00:01:38.430> normal<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.030> slip<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.360> vans<00:01:39.390> but

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
like normal just slip on vans but

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
like normal just slip on vans but
they're<00:01:40.860> super<00:01:41.100> comfortable<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.700> walk<00:01:41.820> around

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
they're super comfortable to walk around

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
they're super comfortable to walk around
and<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:42.840> easy<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.470> me<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.590> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890

and so it's really easy for me to just
pick<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.250> up<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.840> next<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.110> to
