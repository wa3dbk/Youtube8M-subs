00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 You're going to bring me more today. 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 Three cool ways for you, good 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 galera is the following is the following is the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.850
 I'm going to bring one of the ways that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.550
 The truth of today is not is it is vehicle but 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's not such a car so you'll see 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.180
 along the video first here in the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520
 my front of the market is in my 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.230
 back and I can only say so, you already have a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 the ways I put it here today that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.210
 It's our big goal each and it's here. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.039
 I liked it a lot so I put it on 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 also because it was very detailed 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.059
 I really liked him, I found it well. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 the details and maybe change the luck here 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.340
 with him 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 Until then, you can see what's going on. 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 very good looking very cool, does not give 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.760
 Let's go to the beach there where it's located. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.110
 everybody gives a license, it's not there 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.210
 thanks good 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 Come on then, I'll show you there. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.229
 another way for you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 besides the next one is how we talk 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 The truth is that it replaces it. 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 very easy to control you better not to leave 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.400
 of the track was in the straight line and ltd 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.439
 sand I did not get out 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.509
 Look, it's complicated on the bike too. 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.759
 but anyway let's go let's go to the beach 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.770
 I 'm going to make a good come here. 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.990
 so let's park here beautiful 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 foot and mind is not just to fight face 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.880
 you park is good and let's do it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 here is the other car that besides this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.189
 goal we have more what we will see bar see 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 These are not only uses that light yet 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.420
 this goal we have another goal 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.799
 exactly look at that goal here I 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.899
 I put it because he also found it 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.060
 well detailed that sound that some say 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.549
 in the back of the car was very good 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.680
 here you can put the g14 and we will give 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.210
 Come back, we'll go back there. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 and it looks very good I liked it a lot 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.799
 with him and he stepped on to be honest 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.659
 was controlled but this goes from the car that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.430
 you replace in office and replace 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.500
 that the bistek then it got medium 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.270
 I'm a little weary and look, you can see that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 until when you turn a lot to spark 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 of the ground he because he is really well 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220
 demoted but I thought it was cool, man. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.460
 look that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.070
 and toilet of the turns but it does not come right in the hour 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.110
 that with him and even inside really leaves 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.760
 I see and leave a little place there in the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 front and let's squeeze 12 here go 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.710
 better get there fast not there abrahan 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.630
 nice text here it's good I could already 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.370
 stop to flip my beauty 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.690
 I'm here for you to see. 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.790
 inside a little bit 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.440
 Look and ask for more ahead of the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.240
 laden you have is that you can not 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.830
 show very well there is another mount 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 also that you can show inside the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.670
 car but that mold 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.410
 look gives only projects the little sound there by O 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.540
 inside the steering wheel is very detailed even 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.970
 I think it's cool, and here we go. 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.860
 third and last module of today 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.360
 which was one of the more that the legal comic books 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.770
 too much must have given enough 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.330
 I actually work, I think you should have 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.070
 some work to do and if here that 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.280
 in case we are helicopters here we go 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.280
 create look just there look this is see rosinha 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.990
 Aquino was nice to see collor 0 and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.940

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.280
 detailed is not put up for now 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.020
 You want to go up, but look at the propeller. 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.940
 that kind of propeller that 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.350
 round is for me to get out of here if he goes 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.459
 wanting to climb will keep hitting the 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.470
 stops is cool 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.170
 and look, even the inside, you can 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.150
 you see the details to very good here 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
 underneath those lights you know I know 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.530
 there when you want to look for someone 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.560
 There was that one in there. Give it to you. 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.750
 It is if someone left the show and I 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.070
 she however however these lights down here 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.410
 which are those few lights for 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.080
 look we do not know very well but 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.090

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.160
