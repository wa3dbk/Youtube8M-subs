playstation network will be back up by

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.070 
playstation network will be back up by
made<00:00:15.780> third<00:00:16.190> around<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.490> time<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.869> know

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
made third around that time that we know

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.340 
made third around that time that we know
of<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.670> they've<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:21.000> added<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.689> new

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
of and they've actually added a new

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.460 
of and they've actually added a new
system<00:00:22.800> firmware<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:24.170> it's<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.260> going<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
system firmware so it's just going to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.380 
system firmware so it's just going to
completely<00:00:25.859> revamp<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.789> whole<00:00:26.939> entire<00:00:27.269> thing

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
completely revamp the whole entire thing

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.050 
completely revamp the whole entire thing
and<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.680> probably<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.039> pretty<00:00:29.279> big<00:00:29.519> download

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and it's probably a pretty big download

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.209 
and it's probably a pretty big download
so<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.320> might<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> while<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.160> actually

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so it might take a while to actually

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.729 
so it might take a while to actually
download<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.820> firmware<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.630> since<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.680> do

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
download the firmware but since I do

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.049 
download the firmware but since I do
have<00:00:34.950> place<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.370> since<00:00:35.610> everyone<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
have place that since everyone has a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
have place that since everyone has a
PlayStation<00:00:36.570> Plus<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:37.500> another<00:00:37.680> thing<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
PlayStation Plus that's another thing to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260 
PlayStation Plus that's another thing to
mention<00:00:40.129> playstation<00:00:41.129> plus<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:42.239> me

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
mention playstation plus for me

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
mention playstation plus for me
automatically<00:00:42.930> download<00:00:43.440> downloads<00:00:44.129> new

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
automatically download downloads new

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
automatically download downloads new
firmware<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.750> everyone<00:00:46.050> has<00:00:46.320> playstation

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
firmware so if everyone has playstation

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.970 
firmware so if everyone has playstation
plus<00:00:47.160> i'm<00:00:47.430> thinking<00:00:47.850> maybe<00:00:48.829> everyone<00:00:49.829> can

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
plus i'm thinking maybe everyone can

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
plus i'm thinking maybe everyone can
just<00:00:50.129> download<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> automatically<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> what

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
just download it automatically and what

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
just download it automatically and what
it<00:00:52.230> normally<00:00:52.379> does<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.980> turn<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.399> ps3

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it normally does is just turn your ps3

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
it normally does is just turn your ps3
on<00:00:54.000> automatically<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.440> don't<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.010> how<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
on automatically I don't know how it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.569 
on automatically I don't know how it
really<00:00:56.640> does<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.340> does

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
really does that but that's what it does

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.100 
really does that but that's what it does
and<00:00:59.879> hopefully<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.809> will<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:02.190> happen<00:01:03.110> if

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and hopefully that will will happen if

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
and hopefully that will will happen if
