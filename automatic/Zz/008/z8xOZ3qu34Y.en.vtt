00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello, my name is Vladimir 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.180
 information for subscribers of my channel 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.010
 I returned home from Moscow as there 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.840
 some things not islands for work 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.940
 I will upload the video a little bit less 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.119
 the amount of connection with Internet problems 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 there is no normal internet and work 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.240
 Of course there is not a lot but none the less 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.600
 will try to shoot more or less 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.670
 interesting video news 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.400
 I'll do this one on arrival home 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.399
 honestly say nothing 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.070
 still interesting full pouring gurin 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.260
 really very interesting but this car on 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.540
 the sale and there was a problem exploded 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.050
 pillow and cap under the pillow cap 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 buy it is impossible therefore to cover 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.840
 skin 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.800
 no option didn't want just because 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.879
 nonsense to exit what I found now 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.789
 hot glue on the outside of the glue 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.489
 end-to-end align the area before i 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.910
 slightly sandpaper it worked the ends to 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 remove all the burrs from there and 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.950
 the moment of such a plan that there was no later 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.920
 You can see this and torn strip 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.330
 how are some cars made 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 soldering iron neatly I still thought 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.799
 how to make a soldering iron form tomorrow 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.729
 think about it to draw 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.170
 along the break line make thin when 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.030
 brazed seam 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.340
 video on old up in my way 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.619
 made like a line for breaking 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 pillows will try to hide it all 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.740
 let's see what happens with hot melt 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 Well, as if with a finger, we align the plane 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 Yes, and just hot melt we dig and wait 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.659
 until it dries out everything don 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 it is necessary that everything was even 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.799
 without fanaticism how would I have to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.170
 the whole pave center met himself 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.549
 on his own to less glue then he 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.689
 fight like a flat sport docked 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:04.759
 farther from within the pillow here 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.780
 this whole line is not about glue 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.950
 epoxy glue two component 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.959
 coaching keeps drop dead 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.040
 I will not glue anything 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:19.860
 straight just butt fill and leave it 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.269
 the whole thing for the night is dry the night has passed and 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.000
 the last two component completely 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.480
 dried up but it dries in there for two 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 hours well and left for the night 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.290
 that is, calmly then you can beep 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 will click in the center and now I started 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.209
 removing thermo glue is his advantage 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.860
 the fact that he performed the function kept us 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.470
 the plane and now it just takes off 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.829
 crackling and no trace 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.739
 then leave of course a little bit 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.220
 It is necessary to lie with the spirit sharply and well 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:59.620
 very good the alcohol washes away it and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:03.040
 removes remove all glue and think what 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.290
 do with a soldering iron that's what happened 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.780
 after I cleaned the glue joint area 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.470
 hot melt glue soldering irons did not try 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.430
 I took a chance to do it with an awl was 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.560
 told on the stove gas and spent 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.200
 honestly, I didn't shoot because I 'm doing 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.200
 on on everything is very quick and easy 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.540
 one hand is difficult to do that is 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.910
 just repent sewed and literally here 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.340
 such crowns are hot 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.549
 we have time to carry out the most difficult 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 the reality of something complicated is simple 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:43.000
 carry on smoothly and then remove zones where 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.230
 ended and started again but for everything 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.940
 This I spent minutes fifteen-twenty 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:56.829
 now we will clean goes convex as if 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:02.910
 on shelf parts try everything died from 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:12.570
 the blade slowly 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:22.800
 in principle, it goes, but I donâ€™t know how much you 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:26.430
 really do exactly in general we will 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.830
 try out in general thats what i have 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.600
 turned on cut blade agnails 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.600
 the whole pillow this stub turn 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.800
 red scotch bright still 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.800
 I wish I could have burrs 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.260
 more careful but it turned out somehow so I 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.320
 still think may be what you get 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:54.030
 pour the joint then everything is ready and for the role and 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:57.630
 let's see in general, this is what the end has 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.090
 view of our work of course I would like 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.940
 better so all by touch 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.970
 there are no joints but if you look inside 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.010
 there are small villus with them well 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.860
 I can not do anything I took a gray 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.890
 structure for bankers paint spilled 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.440
 butt the excess wiped away with solvents but so 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:23.669
 more or less covered up looks like 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:26.070
 leased line somehow would like 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.550
 Of course it is better to cook and because we have 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.310
 understand 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.830
 I hope the video was useful to you if 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.010
 someone will try something like that 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.410
 do this I advise you not to take the sting 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.020
 acute and most likely with such small 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.880
 rounding at the end maybe it will be 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.380
 better just get right all 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.590
 good luck subscribe to a new video for everyone 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.590
 until
