00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the air using the left stick you can

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.330 
the air using the left stick you can
rotate<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> good<00:00:40.079> landing<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
rotate it to get a good landing what you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.560 
rotate it to get a good landing what you
may<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> actually

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
hold a on xbox or x on ps3 to run take

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
hold a on xbox or x on ps3 to run take
the<00:00:46.170> car<00:00:46.379> horizontally<00:00:47.129> instead<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the car horizontally instead of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
the car horizontally instead of
vertically<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.600> further<00:00:48.840> stick<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> landing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
vertically to further stick the landing

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
vertically to further stick the landing
this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.370> holding<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> hand<00:00:51.000> brake<00:00:51.210> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this is just holding the hand brake in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.880 
this is just holding the hand brake in
the<00:00:51.480> air<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.690> turning<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.469> axis

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the air or turning on a different axis

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
the air or turning on a different axis
which<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.210> helpful<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.719> game

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
which can be very very helpful in game

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.330 
which can be very very helpful in game
and<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.680> let<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.949> stick<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and will really let you stick that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.900 
and will really let you stick that
landing<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.449> away<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.989> perfect<00:00:58.410> speed

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
landing and get away in a perfect speed

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
landing and get away in a perfect speed
our<00:00:59.910> second<00:01:00.359> tip<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> first

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
our second tip is actually in the first

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
our second tip is actually in the first
of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> two<00:01:02.190> helicopter<00:01:03.000> tips<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of the two helicopter tips now that is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.840 
of the two helicopter tips now that is
to<00:01:04.350> say<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> weak<00:01:05.100> spots<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to say there is a weak spots on the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
to say there is a weak spots on the
Buzzard<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:06.720> far<00:01:07.110> weaker

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
Buzzard which is actually far weaker

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
Buzzard which is actually far weaker
than<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> rest<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> heart<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
than all of the rest of the heart this

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.330 
than all of the rest of the heart this
spot<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> back<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.439> behind<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> tail

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
spot is on the back just behind the tail

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
spot is on the back just behind the tail
rotor<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.720> circular<00:01:12.960> vent<00:01:13.350> which

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
rotor it's a little circular vent which

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
rotor it's a little circular vent which
when<00:01:14.130> shot<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:14.640> allow<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> lot<00:01:15.180> more<00:01:15.299> damage

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
when shot will allow a lot more damage

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.210 
when shot will allow a lot more damage
to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.900> castor<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.470> dealt<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> helicopter

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to be castor and dealt to the helicopter

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
to be castor and dealt to the helicopter
so<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.509> doesn't<00:01:18.720> blow<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.170> instantly

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so this doesn't blow it up instantly

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
so this doesn't blow it up instantly
aren't<00:01:20.280> using<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.640> minigun<00:01:20.909> our<00:01:21.090> heavy<00:01:21.270> sniper

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
aren't using a minigun our heavy sniper

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
aren't using a minigun our heavy sniper
on<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> definitely<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
on this is definitely the way to go is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.100 
on this is definitely the way to go is
it<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:23.820> greatly<00:01:23.970> damaged<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> often<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
it will greatly damaged it is often a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
it will greatly damaged it is often a
good<00:01:25.140> tactic<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.799> finish<00:01:26.100> off<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> damaged

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
good tactic to finish off a damaged

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.310 
good tactic to finish off a damaged
Buzzard<00:01:27.180> even<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.229> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
Buzzard even if you don't get it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
Buzzard even if you don't get it
straight<00:01:28.560> from<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> start<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> very

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
straight from the start this is a very

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
straight from the start this is a very
very<00:01:30.329> easy<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:31.049> getting<00:01:31.530> explosions<00:01:32.189> on

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
very easy way of getting explosions on

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.149 
very easy way of getting explosions on
on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> Buzzard<00:01:33.540> whereas<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.560> rest<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
on the Buzzard whereas the rest of it is

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
on the Buzzard whereas the rest of it is
fairly<00:01:35.579> impervious<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> bullets<00:01:36.420> unless<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
fairly impervious to bullets unless you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
fairly impervious to bullets unless you
shoot<00:01:37.200> straight<00:01:37.350> through<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> cockpit<00:01:37.979> which

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
shoot straight through the cockpit which

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069 
shoot straight through the cockpit which
isn't<00:01:38.880> always<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.270> easy<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.689> they're<00:01:39.869> facing

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
isn't always too easy if they're facing

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
isn't always too easy if they're facing
the<00:01:40.290> other<00:01:40.439> direction<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.970> they're

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the other direction so here if they're

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.429 
the other direction so here if they're
trying<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.450> fly<00:01:42.630> away<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.320> you've

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
trying to fly away from you but you've

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.109 
trying to fly away from you but you've
really<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> killed<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:44.490> zoom<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> on

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
really one that killed your zoom in on

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.340 
really one that killed your zoom in on
them<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> heavy<00:01:45.600> sniper<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.079> even<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
them with a heavy sniper or even the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.020 
them with a heavy sniper or even the
minigun<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.340> start

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
minigun if you can and just start

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
minigun if you can and just start
raining<00:01:48.360> down<00:01:48.509> fire<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.110> surely<00:01:49.530> some<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
raining down fire and surely some of the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.340 
raining down fire and surely some of the
bullets<00:01:50.070> are<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.250> hit<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> back<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.350> our

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
bullets are gonna hit the back and our

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
bullets are gonna hit the back and our
last<00:01:52.649> tip<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.430> week<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.970> actually

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
last tip for this week is actually

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.990 
last tip for this week is actually
another<00:01:55.170> helicopter<00:01:55.470> tip<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
another helicopter tip so this is to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
another helicopter tip so this is to
show<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.180> guys<00:01:57.299> another<00:01:57.930> vulnerable<00:01:58.560> spot<00:01:58.860> on

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
show you guys another vulnerable spot on

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.010 
show you guys another vulnerable spot on
the<00:01:59.219> helicopter<00:01:59.820> now<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> works<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.810> all

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the helicopter now this works with all

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
the helicopter now this works with all
helicopters<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.790> cover

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
helicopters that do not have a cover

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
helicopters that do not have a cover
around<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> tower<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.290> such<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
around the tower up to such as the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.160 
around the tower up to such as the
frogadier's<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.270> trick<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:06.630> involves

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
frogadier's this trick actually involves

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
frogadier's this trick actually involves
shooting<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.890> tail<00:02:08.190> rotor<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.209> center<00:02:09.569> if

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
shooting the tail rotor at the center if

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
shooting the tail rotor at the center if
possible<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.009> done<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.310> any

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
possible so this can be done with any

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.130 
possible so this can be done with any
weapon<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.330> really<00:02:12.510> doesn't<00:02:12.780> need

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
weapon and it really doesn't need

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.590 
weapon and it really doesn't need
to<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.650> very<00:02:14.040> high-end<00:02:14.340> weapon<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.450> not

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
to be a very high-end weapon as it's not

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.330 
to be a very high-end weapon as it's not
about<00:02:15.840> how<00:02:16.050> much<00:02:16.260> damage<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.830> really<00:02:17.130> dealt

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
about how much damage is really dealt

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.860 
about how much damage is really dealt
you<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.700> need<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.940> get<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> few<00:02:18.240> bullets<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you just need to get a few bullets on to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.380 
you just need to get a few bullets on to
it<00:02:19.190> shooting<00:02:20.190> at<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.370> tail<00:02:20.580> rotor<00:02:20.819> will

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it shooting at the tail rotor will

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.360 
it shooting at the tail rotor will
actually<00:02:21.780> make<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.200> finally<00:02:22.620> explode<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
actually make it finally explode and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.130 
actually make it finally explode and
this<00:02:23.520> really<00:02:23.790> doesn't<00:02:23.940> take<00:02:24.270> too<00:02:24.450> long<00:02:24.690> it's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
this really doesn't take too long it's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.930 
this really doesn't take too long it's
not<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.319> big<00:02:25.650> fire<00:02:25.980> explosion<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.760> just

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
not a big fire explosion it's just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.220 
not a big fire explosion it's just
something<00:02:27.180> small<00:02:27.330> which<00:02:27.600> will<00:02:27.780> indicate<00:02:27.990> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
something small which will indicate that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.870 
something small which will indicate that
you've<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:28.709> managed<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.130> succeed<00:02:29.670> in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
you've actually managed to succeed in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.300 
you've actually managed to succeed in
your<00:02:30.300> efforts<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:31.709> just<00:02:31.890> make<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
your efforts so it will just make it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.490 
your efforts so it will just make it
explode<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.420> little<00:02:33.750> kind<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.140> puff<00:02:34.350> of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
explode in a little kind of puff of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.290 
explode in a little kind of puff of
smoke<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> course<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.580> helicopter<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
smoke and of course the helicopter to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.210 
smoke and of course the helicopter to
swallow<00:02:36.570> down<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> ground<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.650> saving

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
swallow down to the ground and saving

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.040 
swallow down to the ground and saving
you<00:02:38.370> your<00:02:38.610> life<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.690> works<00:02:39.900> especially

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
you your life so this works especially

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.140 
you your life so this works especially
well<00:02:40.380> against<00:02:40.770> police<00:02:40.950> choppers<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
well against police choppers as the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.059 
well against police choppers as the
police<00:02:42.390> choppers<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:43.020> reckless<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.770> say<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
police choppers are reckless to say the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.120 
police choppers are reckless to say the
least<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.380> pretty<00:02:46.530> much<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.739> for<00:02:46.920> this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
