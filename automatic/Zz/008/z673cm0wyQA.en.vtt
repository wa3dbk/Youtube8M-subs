okay<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.780> i<00:00:53.230> started<00:00:53.590> Joan<00:00:53.800> snowboards

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
okay so i started Joan snowboards

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.650 
okay so i started Joan snowboards
because<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:55.000> felt<00:00:55.450> like<00:00:55.540> there<00:00:56.350> was<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:57.239> need<00:00:58.239> for

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
because I felt like there was a need for

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.160 
because I felt like there was a need for
better<00:00:59.670> all-mountain<00:01:00.670> snowboards<00:01:01.390> out<00:01:01.810> there

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
better all-mountain snowboards out there

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.350 
better all-mountain snowboards out there
and<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.130> also<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.160> new<00:01:06.520> technologies<00:01:07.330> and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
and I also with the new technologies and

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.109 
and I also with the new technologies and
new<00:01:08.020> design<00:01:08.700> advancements<00:01:09.700> we've<00:01:09.850> made<00:01:09.880> it

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119

snowboarding<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.720> felt<00:01:10.930> like<00:01:11.160> there<00:01:12.160> was<00:01:12.280> some

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
snowboarding I felt like there was some

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.490 
snowboarding I felt like there was some
snowboards<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:12.940> really<00:01:13.330> wanted<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.780> to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
snowboards that I really wanted to to

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.469 
snowboards that I really wanted to to
make<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:14.950> weren't<00:01:15.190> on<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.580> market<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.150> was

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
make that weren't on the market I was

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.140 
make that weren't on the market I was
fortunate<00:01:17.200> our<00:01:17.680> year<00:01:18.310> one<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.550> was<00:01:18.850> able<00:01:18.970> to

come<00:01:19.270> out<00:01:19.360> with<00:01:19.540> three<00:01:19.900> new<00:01:20.170> molds<00:01:20.619> completely

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
come out with three new molds completely

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.350 
come out with three new molds completely
from<00:01:21.610> scratch<00:01:21.960> snowboards<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:24.149> they<00:01:25.149> all

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
from scratch snowboards and they all

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
from scratch snowboards and they all
have<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:26.140> combination<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.160> rocker<00:01:27.880> camber

our wood course are FSC certified wood

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.330 
our wood course are FSC certified wood
which<00:02:16.510> means<00:02:16.780> they<00:02:16.959> come<00:02:17.170> from<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.470> sustainable

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
which means they come from a sustainable

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.800 
which means they come from a sustainable
source<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.690> we<00:02:20.650> have<00:02:21.030> film<00:02:22.030> top<00:02:22.299> sheets<00:02:22.630> have

source the we have film top sheets have

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.270 
source the we have film top sheets have
been<00:02:22.870> able<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.230> eliminate<00:02:23.410> plastic<00:02:24.100> top

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
been able to eliminate plastic top

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.890 
been able to eliminate plastic top
sheets<00:02:24.580> from<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> board<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.209> does<00:02:25.660> two

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
sheets from the board that does two

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.560 
sheets from the board that does two
things<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.230> eliminates<00:02:26.769> waste<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.570> it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
things that eliminates waste and it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.690 
things that eliminates waste and it
eliminates<00:02:29.110> almost<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.590> pound<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.980> plastic<00:02:30.100> /

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
eliminates almost a pound of plastic /

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.850 
eliminates almost a pound of plastic /
board<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.870> great<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> reduce

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
board so it's a great way to reduce

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.280 
board so it's a great way to reduce
weight<00:02:33.850> without<00:02:34.350> sacrificing<00:02:35.350> performance
