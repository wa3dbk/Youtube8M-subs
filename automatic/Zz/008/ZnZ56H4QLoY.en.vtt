 olive who can love what sad 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.750
 but I simplify this recipe a little bit so 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.599
 as i already have the finished mix it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.899
 marina tomato 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:43.969
 which is included besides salt baked salt 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:52.820
 vinegar sugar includes all sorts of 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:52.820
 green spices parsley dill 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 what else do we have greens 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.620
 up tomatoes at me this year 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.739
 rolled up according to a special recipe which 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.979
 enters under by tomato which betrayed 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.200
 our tomato tastes very good and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.820
 flavor and next year I will 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.229
 capture only this recipe 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.610
 this marinade 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:28.350
 we did not pour out well, as it were not thrown 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 absolutely we used it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.990
 cabbage and then we poured cabbage 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.950
 leavened you know when cabbage especially 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 in winter it is already dry more so not so 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.329
 juicy and when it is placed on the cold 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.270
 the top layers of cabbage are made dry here 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.310
 we added this brine to this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 cabbage and just he is very nice on 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 smell and taste and since for a moment on on on 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.740
 my taste but just come in here 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.700
 it is felt here and salt and sugar and vinegar 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.810
 and now I have it all 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.330
 I will put this liquid on 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.090
 fire then do people tones up 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 eighty degrees and we will do 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.380
 mustard 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:29.380
 mustard I saw the mustard so that there was no 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:34.450
 I take lumps like this 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:41.220
 spoons length somewhere I want it so that was 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:47.350
 equal amount of mustard powder and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:51.400
 mustard here in grains and 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.900
 one and the other by weight side by volume 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.269
 of course it will be different in a completely different way 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.390
 look because it's harder 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.170
 so the grain must be seen like this 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 a little like an eye 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:15.160
 Now let's stir it to be beautiful 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:20.010
 to feel the trial of these grains somewhere 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.010
 and get one to one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:30.420
 I stir everything well and pour hot 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.420
 marinade 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.580
 make it more so more liquid because 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.459
 that when she stands 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:58.230
 grains and mustard itself naturally 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:04:07.739
 swell and be like it should 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:11.549
 be adding a little marina before and after 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.900
 Stir well cover 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.209
 Marlechku wrap the towel will cover and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.380
 put 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:28.190
 whale battery warm hours 8 through 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.190
 eight hours we'll see what we have better 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:40.639
 as marinade added add another spoon 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.639
 oils 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:02.320
 Now we are covering it with a lamb or a lid 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:06.790
 she is loose so that you want mustard breathed 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.790
 like this and put on heat 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:16.010
 eight hours have passed this mustard 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.639
 It turned out of course you can buy quality 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.720
 and in the store 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:28.039
 but there except for all sorts of additives 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.530
 there are preservatives stabilizers a 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.130
 assistant conditions we can do here 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.520
 such 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:39.729
 real mustard without any harmful 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.280
 additives 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:47.210
 make the amount that we need 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:51.979
 and very quickly I did 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:57.220
 Mustard measure spicy because we 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:06:01.880
 clogged and and the liquid is not very hot 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.750
 if you pour it very hot it will 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.320
 I want a weaker if 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:15.190
 salt some cuddly vodichka or something like that 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:19.070
 Marina there then she will be very so 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:22.280
 they say the people vigorous mean you can 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.340
 use meat soup dishes so 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.030
 sandwich when stick all kinds of 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.610
 sauce so cook it very quickly 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.370
 cook by the way that 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.330
 I showed everyone good and pleasant 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.330
 appetite
