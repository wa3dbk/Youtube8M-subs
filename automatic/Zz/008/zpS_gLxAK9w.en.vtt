minutes<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:40.290> gonna<00:00:40.500> test<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> theory<00:00:41.280> today

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
minutes I'm gonna test this theory today

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
minutes I'm gonna test this theory today
and<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.910> exactly<00:00:42.510> how<00:00:42.809> fast<00:00:43.110> does<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and see exactly how fast does the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
and see exactly how fast does the
Samsung<00:00:44.910> adaptive<00:00:45.390> charger<00:00:45.840> charged<00:00:46.440> the

galaxy s6 on the note 4 it actually does
charged<00:00:50.190> super<00:00:50.700> fast<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.329> half<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
charged super fast I get about half a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.680 
charged super fast I get about half a
charge<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.559> 30<00:00:52.860> minutes<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.910> half<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.449> charge

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
charge in 30 minutes now half a charge

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
charge in 30 minutes now half a charge
in<00:00:54.809> 30<00:00:54.899> minutes<00:00:55.320> does<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.649> mean<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> full

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
in 30 minutes does not mean a full

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
in 30 minutes does not mean a full
charge<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.760> an<00:00:56.879> hour<00:00:57.090> after<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.870> hits<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
charge in an hour after it hits the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 
charge in an hour after it hits the
halfway<00:00:58.530> mark<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.699> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> has<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> build<00:01:00.510> up

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
halfway mark it kind of has to build up

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
halfway mark it kind of has to build up
to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> other<00:01:01.410> half<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.640> an

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to the other half so it's more like an

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
to the other half so it's more like an
hour<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.420> 15<00:01:03.960> minutes<00:01:04.320> or<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> full

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
hour in 15 minutes or so for a full

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
hour in 15 minutes or so for a full
charge<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> note<00:01:06.000> 4<00:01:06.030> note<00:01:06.570> before

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
charge on the note 4 note before

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
charge on the note 4 note before
actually<00:01:07.080> has<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> much<00:01:07.439> larger<00:01:07.680> battery<00:01:08.130> than

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
actually has a much larger battery than

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
actually has a much larger battery than
the<00:01:08.400> s6<00:01:08.880> which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> why<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.780> skeptical<00:01:10.409> as

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the s6 which is why I was skeptical as

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
the s6 which is why I was skeptical as
to<00:01:11.250> how<00:01:11.520> fast<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:12.030> thinking<00:01:12.360> it'll<00:01:12.510> probably

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to how fast I'm thinking it'll probably

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.450 
to how fast I'm thinking it'll probably
do<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.140> than<00:01:13.320> 50%<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.979> half<00:01:14.130> an<00:01:14.220> hour<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
do more than 50% in half an hour but

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.399 
do more than 50% in half an hour but
we're<00:01:14.790> about<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> find<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.810> let's<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.290> ahead

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we're about to find out let's go ahead

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.289 
we're about to find out let's go ahead
and<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.619> started<00:01:16.770> okay<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> guys<00:01:18.060> can

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and get started okay so as you guys can

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.179 
and get started okay so as you guys can
see<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.780> 1%<00:01:19.530> actually<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> probably

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
see we're at 1% actually you probably

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.070 
see we're at 1% actually you probably
can't<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.119> dim<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> screen

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
can't see because it's dim the screen

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.570 
can't see because it's dim the screen
and<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.619> goes<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:23.009> shutting<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and there it goes it's shutting down so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
and there it goes it's shutting down so
we're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.880> ahead<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.060> plug<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
we're gonna go ahead and plug in the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.340 
we're gonna go ahead and plug in the
adaptive<00:01:26.220> charger<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:27.990> soon<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.259> we

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
adaptive charger and then as soon as we

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
adaptive charger and then as soon as we
do<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.799> ahead<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> start<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
do we're gonna go ahead and start the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.090 
do we're gonna go ahead and start the
stopwatch<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> note<00:01:31.470> 4<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.950> we'll<00:01:32.009> go

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stopwatch on the note 4 so we'll go

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.450 
stopwatch on the note 4 so we'll go
ahead<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.310> plug<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:33.950> ok<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> is

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
my battery from the Canon did die and I

my battery from the Canon did die and I
had<00:05:17.950> to<00:05:18.040> swap<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.520> out<00:05:18.580> real<00:05:18.790> quick

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
had to swap it out real quick

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.870 
had to swap it out real quick
I've<00:05:19.750> been<00:05:19.930> anyhow<00:05:20.490> now<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.640> we<00:05:21.760> are

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
I've been anyhow now that we are

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.480 
I've been anyhow now that we are
reaching<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.300> end<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:23.170> the<00:05:23.740> 30<00:05:23.950> minute<00:05:24.220> charge

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
reaching the end of the 30 minute charge

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.970 
reaching the end of the 30 minute charge
I<00:05:24.850> noticed<00:05:25.480> when<00:05:25.630> we<00:05:25.750> were<00:05:25.840> at<00:05:25.960> at<00:05:26.110> about<00:05:26.380> 25

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
I noticed when we were at at about 25

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.610 
I noticed when we were at at about 25
minutes<00:05:27.280> into<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.670> charge<00:05:27.910> we<00:05:28.120> had<00:05:28.240> about<00:05:28.620> 40%

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
minutes into the charge we had about 40%

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.850 
minutes into the charge we had about 40%
battery<00:05:30.010> which<00:05:30.190> kind<00:05:30.580> of<00:05:30.640> lines<00:05:30.850> up<00:05:31.090> with<00:05:31.270> what

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
battery which kind of lines up with what

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.650 
battery which kind of lines up with what
Samsung<00:05:32.860> had<00:05:33.250> promised<00:05:33.820> us<00:05:34.000> which<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.390> one<00:05:34.630> and

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
Samsung had promised us which is one and

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.810 
Samsung had promised us which is one and
a<00:05:34.780> half<00:05:34.810> percent<00:05:35.320> for<00:05:35.440> every<00:05:35.710> minute<00:05:35.919> now<00:05:36.700> that

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
a half percent for every minute now that

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.520 
a half percent for every minute now that
we're<00:05:36.940> actually<00:05:37.030> reaching<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.630> 30<00:05:37.990> minutes

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
we're actually reaching the 30 minutes

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.730 
we're actually reaching the 30 minutes
let's<00:05:38.770> go<00:05:38.890> ahead<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.130> see<00:05:39.340> where<00:05:39.580> we<00:05:39.730> are<00:05:39.910> at

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
let's go ahead and see where we are at

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.880 
let's go ahead and see where we are at
and<00:05:41.740> we're<00:05:41.919> right<00:05:42.100> at<00:05:42.250> 50%<00:05:42.700> which<00:05:43.660> is<00:05:43.890> pretty

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
and we're right at 50% which is pretty

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.740 
and we're right at 50% which is pretty
crazy<00:05:45.130> I<00:05:45.370> was<00:05:45.730> expecting<00:05:46.180> more<00:05:46.390> than<00:05:46.450> that

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
crazy I was expecting more than that

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.810 
crazy I was expecting more than that
considering<00:05:47.650> that<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.890> battery<00:05:48.340> is<00:05:48.460> smaller

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
considering that the battery is smaller

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.960 
considering that the battery is smaller
than<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.300> one<00:05:49.570> m9<00:05:50.370> but<00:05:51.370> we're<00:05:51.520> actually<00:05:51.669> at

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
than the one m9 but we're actually at

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.920 
than the one m9 but we're actually at
50%<00:05:53.220> 50%<00:05:54.220> in<00:05:54.520> 30<00:05:54.700> minutes<00:05:55.060> is<00:05:55.180> not<00:05:55.210> too<00:05:55.660> bad

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
50% 50% in 30 minutes is not too bad

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.960 
50% 50% in 30 minutes is not too bad
it's<00:05:56.169> actually<00:05:56.290> pretty<00:05:57.160> excellent<00:05:57.669> so<00:05:57.820> this

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
it's actually pretty excellent so this

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.520 
it's actually pretty excellent so this
is<00:05:58.120> really<00:05:58.300> great<00:05:58.630> because<00:05:58.840> with<00:05:59.320> that

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
is really great because with that

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.990 
is really great because with that
smaller<00:05:59.830> battery<00:06:00.190> you'll<00:06:00.400> probably<00:06:00.610> run<00:06:00.940> out

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
smaller battery you'll probably run out

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.280 
smaller battery you'll probably run out
before<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.570> end<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.810> day<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.110> if<00:06:02.200> you

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
before the end of the day and if you

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.110 
before the end of the day and if you
needed<00:06:02.560> to<00:06:02.620> go<00:06:02.740> somewhere<00:06:03.010> that<00:06:03.220> evening<00:06:03.700> I

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.550 
battery which is pretty cool the only
downside<00:06:15.669> of<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:15.850> is<00:06:15.970> that<00:06:16.870> we're<00:06:17.110> using<00:06:17.320> it

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
downside of that is that we're using it

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.680 
downside of that is that we're using it
more<00:06:17.770> charging<00:06:18.340> cycles<00:06:18.910> which<00:06:19.210> means<00:06:19.450> that

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
more charging cycles which means that

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.870 
more charging cycles which means that
our<00:06:19.810> battery<00:06:20.200> will<00:06:21.040> die<00:06:21.250> a<00:06:21.280> little<00:06:21.669> quicker

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
our battery will die a little quicker

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.840 
our battery will die a little quicker
over<00:06:22.120> time<00:06:22.830> which<00:06:23.830> is<00:06:24.040> unfortunate<00:06:24.729> because

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
over time which is unfortunate because

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.480 
over time which is unfortunate because
with<00:06:25.390> the<00:06:25.570> s6<00:06:26.110> we<00:06:26.740> have<00:06:26.919> a<00:06:26.950> non<00:06:27.190> removable

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
with the s6 we have a non removable

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.120 
with the s6 we have a non removable
battery<00:06:28.060> which<00:06:28.840> means<00:06:29.080> that<00:06:29.350> when<00:06:29.560> we<00:06:29.710> do<00:06:29.890> use

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
battery which means that when we do use

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.800 
battery which means that when we do use
those<00:06:30.280> extra<00:06:30.490> charge<00:06:30.880> cycles<00:06:31.360> and<00:06:31.479> it<00:06:31.600> dies

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
those extra charge cycles and it dies

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.460 
those extra charge cycles and it dies
quicker<00:06:32.880> then<00:06:33.880> we<00:06:34.120> will<00:06:34.330> be<00:06:34.479> left<00:06:34.750> without<00:06:34.990> a

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
quicker then we will be left without a

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.380 
quicker then we will be left without a
phone<00:06:36.250> or<00:06:36.490> at<00:06:36.580> least<00:06:36.729> a<00:06:36.820> phone<00:06:37.000> that<00:06:37.030> would<00:06:37.300> be

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
phone or at least a phone that would be

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.510 
phone or at least a phone that would be
very<00:06:37.630> hard<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.050> have<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:39.040> battery<00:06:39.310> replace

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
very hard to have the battery replace

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.980 
very hard to have the battery replace
but<00:06:39.880> this<00:06:39.970> is<00:06:40.060> kind<00:06:40.240> of<00:06:40.300> proof<00:06:40.450> here<00:06:40.660> that<00:06:40.690> the

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
but this is kind of proof here that the

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.700 
but this is kind of proof here that the
Samsung<00:06:41.710> Galaxy<00:06:42.490> s6<00:06:43.120> can<00:06:43.510> charge<00:06:43.870> up<00:06:44.169> to<00:06:44.229> 50%

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
Samsung Galaxy s6 can charge up to 50%

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.340 
Samsung Galaxy s6 can charge up to 50%
in<00:06:45.070> 30<00:06:45.400> minutes<00:06:45.790> which<00:06:46.540> is<00:06:46.660> pretty<00:06:46.900> cool

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
in 30 minutes which is pretty cool

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.840 
in 30 minutes which is pretty cool
