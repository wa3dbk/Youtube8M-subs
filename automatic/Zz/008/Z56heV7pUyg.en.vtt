00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.990 
are two or three and
I<00:04:17.930> hope<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.620> course<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.310> will<00:04:19.579> be<00:04:20.260> 10<00:04:21.260> 20<00:04:21.919> 50<00:04:23.590> in

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
I hope of course it will be 10 20 50 in

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.060 
I hope of course it will be 10 20 50 in
some<00:04:26.000> years<00:04:26.210> because<00:04:26.930> it's<00:04:27.290> important<00:04:27.889> that

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
some years because it's important that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.370 
some years because it's important that
the<00:04:28.220> woman<00:04:28.370> take<00:04:28.930> place<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:30.229> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
the woman take place in the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.129 
the woman take place in the
decision-making<00:04:31.240> bodies<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.870> small

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
decision-making bodies so a small

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.590 
decision-making bodies so a small
Federation<00:04:33.740> with<00:04:33.919> big<00:04:34.160> results<00:04:34.580> can<00:04:35.150> Sweden

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
Federation with big results can Sweden

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.540 
Federation with big results can Sweden
be<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> model<00:04:36.139> for<00:04:36.169> other<00:04:36.440> Federation's<00:04:37.250> around

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
be a model for other Federation's around

the<00:04:37.669> globe<00:04:37.820> with<00:04:38.060> limited<00:04:38.479> resources<00:04:38.510> yes<00:04:39.410> I

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
the globe with limited resources yes I

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.379 
the globe with limited resources yes I
think<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:39.860> because<00:04:40.330> like<00:04:41.330> in<00:04:41.690> Sweden<00:04:42.169> most

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
think so because like in Sweden most

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.219 
think so because like in Sweden most
countries<00:04:44.440> perhaps<00:04:45.440> don't<00:04:45.830> have<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.880> many

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
countries perhaps don't have that many

countries perhaps don't have that many
young<00:04:48.229> woman<00:04:48.770> riders<00:04:49.160> perhaps<00:04:49.820> they<00:04:50.030> are

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
young woman riders perhaps they are

this project that we were carried out I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.779 
this project that we were carried out I
think<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.110> would<00:05:03.500> be<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.680> model<00:05:04.130> for<00:05:04.370> more

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789
