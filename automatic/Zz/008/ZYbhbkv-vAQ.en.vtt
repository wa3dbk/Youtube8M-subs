00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
made simple calm a while back now in

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.560 
made simple calm a while back now in
case<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.079> wondering<00:00:34.230> no<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.550> idea<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.300> not

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
case you're wondering no the idea is not

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
case you're wondering no the idea is not
dead<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.320> quite<00:00:37.559> full<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> life<00:00:38.160> actually

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
dead it's quite full of life actually

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
dead it's quite full of life actually
the<00:00:39.120> reason<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.629> been<00:00:39.780> taking<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.440> long<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the reason it's been taking so long is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
the reason it's been taking so long is
because<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.399> entire<00:00:41.670> website<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.300> actually

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
because the entire website has actually

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900 
because the entire website has actually
been<00:00:42.960> made<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> destroyed<00:00:43.980> three<00:00:44.610> times

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
been made and destroyed three times

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.610 
been made and destroyed three times
already

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
already

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
already
now<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> original<00:00:46.890> site<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.640> made<00:00:47.670> with

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
now the original site was made with

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.010 
now the original site was made with
WordPress<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:50.340> problem<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.600> our

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
WordPress the only problem was our

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.869 
WordPress the only problem was our
Jurassic<00:00:52.680> limitations<00:00:53.309> while<00:00:53.489> using

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
Jurassic limitations while using

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.240 
Jurassic limitations while using
WordPress<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.510> couldn't<00:00:54.840> set<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> site<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
WordPress we couldn't set up the site so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.619 
WordPress we couldn't set up the site so
it<00:00:56.340> was<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.579> easy<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> navigate<00:00:57.449> through

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it was very easy to navigate through

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.000 
it was very easy to navigate through
videos<00:00:57.989> courses<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.859> after<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
videos courses and so on so after that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
videos courses and so on so after that
plan<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> failed

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
plan kind of failed

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.490 
plan kind of failed
I<00:01:03.989> tried<00:01:04.470> coding<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> myself<00:01:05.540> now<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> am<00:01:06.990> NOT<00:01:07.200> as

Java<00:01:20.390> C++<00:01:21.390> stuff<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
Java C++ stuff like that so it was it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.130 
Java C++ stuff like that so it was it
proved<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.420> challenge<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.930> big

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
proved to be a challenge so the big

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.810 
proved to be a challenge so the big
challenge<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.280> wanted<00:01:32.549> major

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
couldn't really get that because of lack

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.620 
couldn't really get that because of lack
of<00:01:38.189> experience<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.759> after<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.119> entire<00:01:39.390> two

months<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.229> trying<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> code<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.070> gave

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
months of me trying to code this I gave

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.289 
months of me trying to code this I gave
up<00:01:41.810> from<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.850> dark<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.119> another

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
up from then on it's at dark for another

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.830 
up from then on it's at dark for another
three<00:01:45.600> months<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:47.360> while<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.750> I'm

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
three months so while you know I'm

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.060 
three months so while you know I'm
making<00:01:48.960> videos<00:01:49.259> I'm<00:01:49.619> doing<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.009> stuff

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
making videos I'm doing all this stuff

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
making videos I'm doing all this stuff
Cody<00:01:50.670> made<00:01:50.850> symbols<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.360> getting<00:01:51.600> any

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
Cody made symbols not getting any

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.770 
Cody made symbols not getting any
progress<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.860> done

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
progress actually done

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.350 
progress actually done
so<00:01:54.530> then<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.740> realized<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.400> this<00:01:55.610> website<00:01:55.850> has

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
so then I realized that this website has

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.060 
so then I realized that this website has
to<00:01:56.570> get<00:01:56.720> done<00:01:56.900> I<00:01:57.110> mean<00:01:57.230> I've<00:01:57.410> spent<00:01:57.590> too<00:01:57.920> much

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
to get done I mean I've spent too much

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.690 
to get done I mean I've spent too much
time<00:01:58.130> telling<00:01:58.850> telling<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.780> guys<00:01:59.930> about<00:01:59.990> it

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
time telling telling you guys about it

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.670 
time telling telling you guys about it
and<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.300> need<00:02:02.360> professional<00:02:02.630> courses<00:02:03.350> made

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
and you need professional courses made

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.610 
and you need professional courses made
specifically<00:02:04.370> for<00:02:04.490> coding<00:02:05.120> made<00:02:05.240> simple

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
specifically for coding made simple

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.279 
specifically for coding made simple
I<00:02:06.650> mean<00:02:07.220> I'm<00:02:07.340> currently<00:02:07.610> sitting<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:08.360> over<00:02:08.570> 15

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
I mean I'm currently sitting on over 15

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.520 
I mean I'm currently sitting on over 15
hours<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.860> content<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.880> site<00:02:11.170> now<00:02:12.170> just
