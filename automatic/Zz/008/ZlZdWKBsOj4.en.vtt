 hi everyone today you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 show how to decorate a terrarium - 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 it will be a pitch for pogonat so 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.259
 I separated but two pogonat so I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.330
 decor is for it to be more than 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.470
 jailers or for that you will need to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 tile adhesive with a paintbrush 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.789
 pigments so natural pigments of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.760
 preference of a cutter and polyester 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.820
 so here we are for the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 manufacturing so here I am going to you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.230
 show how I'm going to proceed so 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.640
 first of all you have to take your 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.219
 pieces of polyester and carve them to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.039
 So would the like to form at 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.440
 a kind of natural landscape so that's 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.899
 the ideal because if it's not natural 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 low not so good I advise you 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.739
 inspire photos that you can 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:04.619
 find on the internet that in fact it takes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:08.909
 to carve an aspect a bit like 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 stone and then you ask me 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 want to hang them for 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 hang the monk I advise 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.950
 to use stressful toothpicks 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.950
 let's be a little gore 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:39.469
 that you can have a glimpse of what 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:41.600
 that sell in the end a little tip 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.600
 so for making it more natural so 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 the saddle on a column will support the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.710
 base to small the shape you can 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.619
 slightly make a relief is that a 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.179
 lighter so do not leave lighter 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.110
 too long otherwise it burned 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:04.220
 but just enough to make 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.709
 sailboats knew it like that I wanted 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.099
 so to just make an appearance like 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.549
 stone 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:13.069
 that in grains a lot better on them on 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.200
 the field but in the end you can 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.130
 do that especially the decor too can 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.970
 even use a ludovic torch it's 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.760
 great but that's how you can 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.140
 see it I finished my decor so I have 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.239
 put a kind of small columns for 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.530
 support the platform that is here and there 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.690
 a gateway to see climb up 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.780
 and there I would surely put stones 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.170
 so that they can access right here 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.560
 and so here I am here I did 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.970
 columns so like stone 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.489
 so I decided not too much charge for 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.810
 not that it's a bit heavy you've got 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.019
 so now it remains more than the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.630
 painting is so for that I used to 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.389
 the dokken tile adhesive a first 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.579
 layer of tile adhesive and a 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.019
 second layer with pigment and the 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.519
 third would have been in some places 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.709
 to make nuances a little bit as 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.599
 this video is going to be a bit long 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.769
 so I'm going to do it in two parts 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.209
 it is to be the part one with a little the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.660
 valves to the structure and I'm going to do 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.400
 a second part for good painting 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.400
 go hello not hesitate to like
