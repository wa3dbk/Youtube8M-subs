00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
definitely in the adult market so it was

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.959 
definitely in the adult market so it was
important<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.860> differentiate<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
important to me to differentiate I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.729

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and so making her a half-vampire just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
and so making her a half-vampire just
sort<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> fell<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.789> what<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:56.879> you
