00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello friends welcome to our channel 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.710
 carol tv varieties today 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 let's make some earrings in acrylic 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.150
 ideal for any time of day 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.930
 materials that we will need are the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.410
 next oval molar ironwork a couple 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.600
 Acrylic 7 x 10 tangshan and two 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.790
 units square hardware 2 units 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.700
 6 mm acrylic black demon 8 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.700
 units and butterflies 2 units 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.290
 well then let's start here in 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.020
 the design table 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.710
 I have the earrings I had on display 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.980
 this moment that are these I made two 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.580
 colors for you to see the way 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.010
 as you can not combine them and we have in 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 our page many more colors the same 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.780
 in these tones there are also those depends 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.640
 as you want to combine it for 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.810
 make them the first thing that we have to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.979
 to do is take the square bases 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.400
 It was teams we are going to expand a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.230
 little doing this 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.860
 a round tip you make a 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.860
 little pressure 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.910
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.530
 because I got it extended because 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.140
 we do not need in these arts 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.090
 we are not moving if we do not have 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.829
 movement will be placed is hoop I 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.100
 I want them to look rigid if 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.100
 you see they move like that but for 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.909
 they are usually static when they are not 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.119
 they place them 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.119
 then when we have already expanded 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.350
 be very careful not to go from the base 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.410
 quote so the first thing we have to 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.410
 do 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.680
 well I hope that I stay well 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.270
 Well, now 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.120
 let's cut these tears come 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.470
 welded, what I do is cut here 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.470
 in this way 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.090
 A) Yes 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.830
 and I would have a ring 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.290
 ajar then I take a round tip 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.970
 and lifted a little up a lot 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.210
 be careful because this is wrong and you can 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.500
 we are going to raise a little of this 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.980
 way and let's thin the tip 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.980
 cutting diagonally 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.630
 so then I'm left as a kind 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.650
 of triangle to be able to stay 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.519
 easy 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.640
 do this to her I get him he does not know 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.380
 move later as complicated 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.780
 what do I want it to be like that 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.440
 rigid and then with a flat-nose plier 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 I'm going to close a bit 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.120
 no longer 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.129
 then the air is going to look like this 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 when I already have it that way around the 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.120
 glue stones 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.290
 which is special for stones and what 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.739
 I'm going to do is when I take it deep and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.200
 I apply too much and what happens 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.420
 is that it stained the stones what is 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.269
 picking up and it's as bad as being 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.870
 then sitting what I do is I do 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.569
 with wires it a kind of ring 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.590
 I take the glue that I want and also I 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.340
 it serves to spread then look like this 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.990
 there is no excess of excess 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.760
 and later 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.760
 then I take a tear 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.350
 the attachment 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.960
 it's better to a little bit then what I 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.960
 I do is 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:39.390
 well here is the process with the 4 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.060
 Now what I'm going to do is 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.700
 will fill the inside 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.200
 we do the same thing we take the glue with 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.080
 the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.509
 little bit like that 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.509
 and we started to apply 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.750
 luck are relatively easy easy 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.690
 what happens is that at this moment 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.620
 tend to be used a lot because they are 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:21.229
 bright and they are small 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.229
 and geometric shapes are in fashion 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:37.329
 Our idea is almost always to 

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:40.699
 you guys when we give you the tutorials 

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:43.639
 it's like at the same time we teach them how 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.079
 things are also done to tell them what 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.579
 that what they find in fashion is fashionable 

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:48.579
 Our company variety download 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.410
 so every time you watch a video 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.810
 those that leave on Mondays and Fridays 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.580
 Every time you see a tutorial, they go 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.720
 to realize that what at the moment 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.660
 is using that is fashionable 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:12.160
 and in the blog we also place 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.640
 in comments about the accessory that 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.640
 We have 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.659
 accomplished 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.800
 in this way the acrylics are placed 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:27.370
 being very careful not to take off 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.310
 because when it dries it's very complicated 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.930
 to remove the same can be removed but 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.199
 Well, the idea is to have them all at once 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.860
 well done depends a lot on how you 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.860
 apply the glue 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.590
 let's see how it looks and the same thing I do with 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.050
 the product with us two 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.620
 now I just need to place the 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.620
 butterflies 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.830
 and so we have finished those that are left of 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.830
 cute 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.500
 we do not have a next opportunity 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.030
 good friends and that's all for today 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.980
 I hope you liked the program 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.810
 see you in a next opportunity with 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.400
 a new lord for you remember 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.320
 Your comments are very important for 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.860
 me and that they give them a like until a 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.860
 next opportunity
