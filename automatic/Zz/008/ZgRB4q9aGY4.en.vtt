00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
years old so you have to think about

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.689

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
even with these old strings and so I'll

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.770 
even with these old strings and so I'll
just<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.300> into<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> play<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.710> stuff
