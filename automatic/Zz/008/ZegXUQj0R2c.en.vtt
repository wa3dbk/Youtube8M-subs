I<00:00:21.300> can't<00:00:21.600> even<00:00:21.689> shave<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.160> assembly<00:00:23.460> I

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I can't even shave and do the assembly I

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.740 
I can't even shave and do the assembly I
say<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.760> on

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
say it's on

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.349 
say it's on
so<00:00:25.230> I'll<00:00:25.470> sure<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.830> make<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.430> we'll<00:00:27.090> start

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so I'll sure to make it and we'll start

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.279 
so I'll sure to make it and we'll start
now<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.050> first<00:00:28.439> off<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> circle<00:00:30.140> we<00:00:31.140> need

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
now so first off is get a circle we need

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.090 
now so first off is get a circle we need
to<00:00:31.579> freescale<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> basically<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to freescale it so basically like it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340 
to freescale it so basically like it
small<00:00:35.399> societies<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.110> free<00:00:37.290> or

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
small societies but then you can free or

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
small societies but then you can free or
scale<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.559> about<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.820> size<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> need

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
scale it about that size then you need

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.549 
scale it about that size then you need
to<00:00:39.809> tilt<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:41.270> now<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> need<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> put<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to tilt it now I need to put it like so

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.330 
to tilt it now I need to put it like so
basically<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.210> bottom<00:00:46.200> left<00:00:46.620> side<00:00:46.739> right

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
basically the the bottom left side right

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
basically the the bottom left side right
side<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.940> middle<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.809> basically<00:00:49.230> just

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
side and middle of basically just

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.330 
side and middle of basically just
touching<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.510> fill<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.780> generally<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
touching I fill out that generally so I

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.229 
touching I fill out that generally so I
need<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> need<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> meet<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.050> black

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
need to go to need to meet this black

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.410 
need to go to need to meet this black
copy<00:00:57.239> paste<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> need<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.270> meet

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
copy paste it and then you need to meet

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
copy paste it and then you need to meet
that<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.680> use<00:01:01.829> made<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.190> little

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that one then you use made out little

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
that one then you use made out little
bits<00:01:03.650> think<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.189> our<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
bits think like in our so basically the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.539 
bits think like in our so basically the
outline<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.960> black<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> base<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
outline is black and the base up the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.520 
outline is black and the base up the
drawing<00:01:08.810> now<00:01:09.890> simple<00:01:10.890> enough<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
drawing now simple enough you need a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.690 
drawing now simple enough you need a
very<00:01:13.640> support<00:01:14.640> square<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.220> make

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
very support square you need to make

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.120 
very support square you need to make
this<00:01:17.820> black<00:01:19.939> it's<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> free<00:01:21.210> scalar

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.399 

now<00:01:25.130> give<00:01:25.280> me<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.399> bit<00:01:25.579> smaller

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
now give me a bit smaller

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:35.130 
now give me a bit smaller
please<00:01:27.409> get<00:01:27.590> over<00:01:30.250> now<00:01:31.250> stop<00:01:31.610> it

he<00:01:40.869> says<00:01:41.079> free<00:01:41.380> scalar<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.920> basically<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.429> goes

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
he says free scalar so basically it goes

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.440 
he says free scalar so basically it goes
it's<00:01:43.929> tiny<00:01:44.140> butter<00:01:44.590> goes<00:01:45.340> with<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.549> thing<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
it's tiny butter goes with the thing it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.569 
it's tiny butter goes with the thing it
used<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.719> be<00:01:49.810> like<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.439> top<00:01:50.619> part<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:51.310> it

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
used to be like on the top part of it

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
make the line a bit lower I need to

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.809 
make the line a bit lower I need to
choose<00:02:01.929> what<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.229> want<00:02:02.469> now<00:02:03.189> I<00:02:03.219> need<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.549> get<00:02:03.789> a

choose what I want now I need to get a

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.930 
choose what I want now I need to get a
circle<00:02:07.739> it's<00:02:08.739> really<00:02:08.979> company<00:02:09.519> I<00:02:09.610> know<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.819> do

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
circle it's really company I know you do

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.650 
circle it's really company I know you do
this<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> they<00:02:12.549> need<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:12.970> make<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.299> really

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
this so they need to make that really

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.819 
this so they need to make that really
really<00:02:13.780> tiny<00:02:14.260> tiny<00:02:14.620> time<00:02:14.829> time<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.250> tell<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
really tiny tiny time time to tell and

really tiny tiny time time to tell and
now<00:02:20.829> you<00:02:20.980> see<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:22.239> put<00:02:22.599> just<00:02:22.900> near<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.170> mouth

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
now you see just put just near the mouth

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.449 
now you see just put just near the mouth
maybe<00:02:24.160> make<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.579> up<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> bit<00:02:24.849> lower<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:30.099> now

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
maybe make them up a bit lower and now

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:40.150 
maybe make them up a bit lower and now
you<00:02:30.519> copy<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:30.940> paste<00:02:31.000> that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.020 

if<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.730> pay<00:02:40.910> attention<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:43.460> actual

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
if you pay attention to the actual

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.410 
if you pay attention to the actual
drawing<00:02:44.360> itself<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.020> can<00:02:45.170> see<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.240> like

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
drawing itself you can see that is like

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.570 
drawing itself you can see that is like
little<00:02:47.660> Lions<00:02:48.260> coming<00:02:48.710> out<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.070> eyes<00:02:49.190> that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
little Lions coming out of the eyes that

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.120 
little Lions coming out of the eyes that
make<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.360> look<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.320> make<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.800> else<00:02:51.980> on

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
make you look that make it the else on

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
you can save the emblem and don't have a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.380 
you can save the emblem and don't have a
look<00:03:58.860> at<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.130> what<00:03:59.250> you've<00:03:59.400> done<00:03:59.430> right<00:04:00.180> now

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
look at to what you've done right now

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.480 
look at to what you've done right now
we've<00:04:00.570> done<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.080> emblem<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.800> it's<00:04:02.160> quite

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
we've done the emblem and it's quite

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.420 
we've done the emblem and it's quite
close<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.300> first<00:04:03.720> one<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:05.070> first<00:04:05.100> one

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
close to the first one the first one

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.820 
close to the first one the first one
looks<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.730> bit<00:04:05.760> better<00:04:06.510> maybe<00:04:07.050> made<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.530> eyes<00:04:07.800> a

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
looks a bit better maybe made the eyes a

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.370 
looks a bit better maybe made the eyes a
little<00:04:08.250> bit<00:04:08.550> bigger<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.030> Alliance<00:04:10.020> bit<00:04:10.170> more

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
little bit bigger and Alliance bit more

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.240 
little bit bigger and Alliance bit more
longer<00:04:11.180> apart<00:04:12.180> from<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:13.680> genuine<00:04:14.040> okay

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
longer apart from that it's genuine okay

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.570 
longer apart from that it's genuine okay
I<00:04:14.459> think<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.120> second<00:04:15.900> one<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.140> actually<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.739> bit

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
I think the second one is actually a bit

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.110 
I think the second one is actually a bit
more<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:18.650> little<00:04:19.650> bit<00:04:19.680> more

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
more a little bit more

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.480 
more a little bit more
that<00:04:21.120> less<00:04:21.419> done<00:04:22.079> up<00:04:22.230> by<00:04:22.410> look<00:04:22.770> than<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.310> first

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
that less done up by look than the first

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.600 
that less done up by look than the first
one<00:04:23.640> but<00:04:23.790> if<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.840> want<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.320> be<00:04:25.440> good<00:04:25.770> just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
one but if you want it to be good just

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.220 
one but if you want it to be good just
tweak<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> as<00:04:27.330> much<00:04:27.480> as<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.660> like<00:04:27.840> and

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
tweak it as much as you like and

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.340
