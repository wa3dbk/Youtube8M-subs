00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.189
 warm pigeon salad with vegetables 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.400
 sour crunchy bitter from Lucan and pine nuts 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:14.350
 the use of bitter lucan in the kitchen is a 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.690
 quite difficult use however I believe that 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.119
 we probably opened one 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.960
 new road the idea of ​​using the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.590
 elixir of essences concentrates with 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.560
 of the strong perfumes so so sour 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 so 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 the acids so concentrated in the kitchen is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.250
 quite difficult however with meat 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 pigeon I think it's an idea 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.210
 perfect first in this dish 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.150
 I have to prepare the vegetables I chose 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.890
 baby vegetables then vegetables 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.019
 and we have very small ones 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 peppers we have some courgettes 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.280
 carrots and then small courses 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.229
 raleigh and dolphin boiling water must 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 I'm going to make potatoes and come back in 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.810
 French technical jargon as older 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 natural take this form a little 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 let's say barrel no detail and I'm leaving 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.549
 to turn fennel cut take off 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.790
 exactly the external parts as well 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.159
 let's start the carrots fur then take the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.200
 zucchina line we give ourselves so for then 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.590
 go open when it is cooked then 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.310
 first we cook the vegetables more 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.080
 hard no so let's start with the fennel 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.749
 let it boil a few minutes later 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.729
 I'll put the carrot 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:42.539
 then the potatoes then cut even two pieces 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.819
 of peppers I remove the seeds well in the meantime 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.969
 the vegetables I cook prepare some 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.740
 shallot flavored oil that will be 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.259
 to the dressing that I will then go to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 emulsify with the bitter Lucan I put 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.369
 inside I add a little bit of salt 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.950
 after a few minutes of cooking 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.170
 fennel add carrots then meanwhile 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.600
 that vegetables can however only the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.479
 pigeon thread of extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.050
 olive a few minutes then put the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.310
 pigeon add the words potatoes in the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 shallot vegetables 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.319
 here's an important thing when we do 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.360
 an oil flavored oil should not 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.930
 just boil just warm up 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.760
 70 80 degrees and ready at this point 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.560
 the oil is still slightly chance 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.340
 adds 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.459
 I am going to emulsify the bitter Lucan 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.080
 so I add a little pepper 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.380
 we leave here on one side I put the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.380
 zucchini 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.849
 net the pigeon cook cut the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.430
 mustard for no small piece of fruit e 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.569
 I keep it here on one side I leave the oil 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.519
 add the peppers around the pigeon 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.140
 here is the pigeon I go aromatizing 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.880
 with a little bit of rosemary so in 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.870
 cooking maybe puts a slice of 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.549
 garlic also garlic in shirt 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.590
 of course because otherwise it comes out 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.510
 all the city in a good we do 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.870
 brown 56 minutes cooking 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.060
 pigeon slightly to the blood but it is 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.920
 overcooked meat from ghana then we 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.959
 we are going to cook it becomes too much 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.140
 stringy could become a bit harsh 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.799
 a little leathery no vegetables are almost 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.390
 ready for that ice for vegetables 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.549
 passed into the water and ice because I want to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.349
 brighten the color continuously 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.950
 pigeon cooking for a couple of 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.739
 minutes 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.840
 well at this point the meat is almost 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.519
 ready, however , I want him to do a 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.000
 step in the oven for a couple of 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.579
 minutes 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.290
 well then at this point or the pigeon 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:45.049
 in the oven the prepared vegetables emulsion of 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.579
 prepared bitter lucano oils I must submit 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.579
 pine nuts with a drop 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.970
 a handful of pine nuts and we do 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.600
 brown a few minutes then this 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.170
 point I take a drop of oil I take the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.270
 vegetables and step lightly in the pan 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.400
 here he passes them in the pan because he has to 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.290
 moment a little revive the color 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.050
 some vegetables must take that 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.390
 gloss that the oil just slightly 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.390
 lukewarm scope of the thread of salt 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:26.130

 and the vegetables are ready the pigeon is 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.050
 ready I put a grain of salt 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.720
 especially the pine nuts are testing 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.669
 here at this point we have all the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.770
 ingredients ready to be implanted 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.880
 first place the vegetables on 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.040
 center of the plate 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.830
 I take the mustard I admit so I take 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.550
 we watch the pigeon the pigeon 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.680
 with the skin split in half and we do 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.370
 a cut to the French one cut in half 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.430
 with the knife held obliquely no so 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.650
 exactly this way 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.360
 i take the pigeon back on one 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.419

 and it must also be slightly 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:27.000
 I put it so little on 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.490
 said a bit of juice to show it is so 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.830
