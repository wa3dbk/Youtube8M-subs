so<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.680> decided<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.250> take<00:00:08.730> out<00:00:08.970> my<00:00:09.240> old

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
so I have decided to take out my old

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.230 
so I have decided to take out my old
wild<00:00:10.260> hawk<00:00:10.440> that's<00:00:11.340> been<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.700> my<00:00:11.820> shelf<00:00:12.090> for

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
wild hawk that's been in my shelf for

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.939 
wild hawk that's been in my shelf for
year<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> half<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:13.679> years<00:00:13.710> maybe<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.429> have

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
year and a half two years maybe I have

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.170 
year and a half two years maybe I have
rebuilt<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:17.369> gonna<00:00:17.730> show<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.000> some

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
rebuilt it I'm gonna show you some

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.510 
rebuilt it I'm gonna show you some
pictures<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.660> what<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.900> looked<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
pictures of what it looked like and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.090 
pictures of what it looked like and
where<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.789> right<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> flight

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
where I'm at right now I have a flight

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.429 
where I'm at right now I have a flight
controller<00:00:23.490> board<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> quadcopter<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
controller board for a quadcopter that I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
controller board for a quadcopter that I
want<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> use<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.099> airplane<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.990> future

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
want to use on this airplane for future

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.720 
want to use on this airplane for future
fpv<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.510> flight<00:00:30.510> stabilization<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.669> get

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
fpv and flight stabilization so if I get

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.459 
fpv and flight stabilization so if I get
that<00:00:33.000> board<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> work<00:00:33.510> properly<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.200> it's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that board to work properly I think it's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110 
that board to work properly I think it's
gonna<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.710> an<00:00:34.800> awesome<00:00:34.950> platform<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.880> for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
gonna be an awesome platform here for

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.319 
gonna be an awesome platform here for
future<00:00:36.780> fpv<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:40.040> quadcopter

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
future fpv so here is the quadcopter

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
future fpv so here is the quadcopter
board<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.930> using<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
board I'm going to be using this is the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
board I'm going to be using this is the

open<00:00:51.660> arrow<00:00:51.899> firmware<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> board<00:00:53.270> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
open arrow firmware to this board in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.160 
open arrow firmware to this board in
order<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.750> work<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.140> airplane<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:57.170> I'm

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
order to work for this airplane and I'm

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
order to work for this airplane and I'm
hoping<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> good<00:00:58.980> results<00:00:59.489> for<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
hoping to get good results for the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.119 
hoping to get good results for the
flight<00:01:01.070> stabilization<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.710> like<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.830> said<00:01:05.040> if

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
flight stabilization and like I said if

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.160 
flight stabilization and like I said if
you<00:01:05.220> try<00:01:05.369> fpb<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> find<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.990> way<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you try fpb I'm going to find a way to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
you try fpb I'm going to find a way to
mount<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.650> board<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.010> somewhere<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.580> will

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
mount this board here somewhere I will

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
mount this board here somewhere I will
take<00:01:09.450> pictures<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> complete<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.310> project

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
take pictures as I complete this project

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.080 
take pictures as I complete this project
and<00:01:12.200> hopefully<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.590> tuned<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and hopefully get this tuned up and a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:02:24.179 
and hopefully get this tuned up and a
test<00:01:15.630> flight<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.990> shortly

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.460 

okay<00:02:25.189> so<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.180> where<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:26.989> ended<00:02:27.319> up

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
okay so this is the where I ended up

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.280 
okay so this is the where I ended up
mounting<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.099> circular<00:02:28.610> board<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.079> best

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
mounting the circular board not the best

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.750 
mounting the circular board not the best
location<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:32.540> will<00:02:32.689> work<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.079> now<00:02:33.640> let<00:02:34.640> me

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
location but it will work for now let me

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.190 
location but it will work for now let me
just<00:02:34.970> show<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.269> really<00:02:35.510> quick<00:02:35.870> right<00:02:36.049> now

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
just show you really quick right now

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.589 
just show you really quick right now
everything's<00:02:36.650> normal

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
everything's normal

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.449 
everything's normal
up-down<00:02:38.769> left-right<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.799> of<00:02:42.920> course<00:02:43.159> we<00:02:43.280> have

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
up-down left-right and of course we have

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.729 
up-down left-right and of course we have
the<00:02:43.609> rudder<00:02:43.819> which<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.120> bring<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.780> can't<00:02:45.200> see

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.460 

so<00:02:48.739> anyways<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.280> right<00:02:49.939> now<00:02:50.349> stabilization<00:02:51.349> is

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
so anyways so right now stabilization is

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.349 
so anyways so right now stabilization is
off<00:02:51.650> see<00:02:52.250> how<00:02:52.430> I'm<00:02:52.489> going<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:52.819> before<00:02:53.180> and

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
off see how I'm going back before and

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.809 
off see how I'm going back before and
this<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.569> happening<00:02:54.079> now<00:02:54.260> I'm<00:02:55.220> gonna<00:02:55.400> flip<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
this is happening now I'm gonna flip the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.819 
this is happening now I'm gonna flip the
switch<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.450> activate<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:57.079> on<00:02:58.389> do<00:02:59.389> that<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.709> it

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
switch to activate it on do that so it

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:08.259 
switch to activate it on do that so it
compensates<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:06.790> really<00:03:07.790> kind<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.030> see<00:03:08.150> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
compensates you really kind of see the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.470 
compensates you really kind of see the
elevator<00:03:08.629> or<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.170> rudder<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.329> can<00:03:11.329> hear

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
elevator or the rudder but I can hear

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:22.599 
elevator or the rudder but I can hear
the<00:03:11.569> surf<00:03:11.750> was<00:03:11.959> going<00:03:19.870> pretty<00:03:20.870> cool<00:03:21.459> let's<00:03:22.459> go

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
the surf was going pretty cool let's go

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.119 
the surf was going pretty cool let's go
test<00:03:22.909> flight<00:03:23.349> here<00:03:24.349> we<00:03:24.470> are<00:03:24.500> at<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.889> flying

winds<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.310> she'll<00:03:40.519> be<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.639> good<00:03:40.849> test<00:03:41.090> for<00:03:41.209> this

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
winds so she'll be a good test for this

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.839 
winds so she'll be a good test for this
I'm<00:03:42.049> gonna<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.440> an<00:03:42.530> onboard<00:03:42.949> camera<00:03:43.400> in<00:03:43.669> here

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
I'm gonna have an onboard camera in here

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.899 
I'm gonna have an onboard camera in here
as<00:03:43.940> well<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.889> I<00:03:45.889> have<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> little<00:03:46.730> piece<00:03:46.879> of

as well and I have a little piece of

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.629 
as well and I have a little piece of
tape<00:03:47.209> over<00:03:47.329> my<00:03:47.569> microphone<00:03:48.169> so<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.340> may<00:03:49.459> not

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
tape over my microphone so you may not

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.320 
tape over my microphone so you may not
be<00:03:49.730> able<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.940> hear<00:03:50.120> me<00:03:50.299> too

be able to hear me too
because<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> wind<00:03:52.740> gust<00:03:53.180> sound<00:03:54.180> come

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
because with the wind gust sound come

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.750 
because with the wind gust sound come
out<00:03:54.600> pretty<00:03:54.870> bad<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.500> let's<00:03:55.740> check<00:03:56.610> out<00:03:56.730> this

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
out pretty bad so let's check out this

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.000 
out pretty bad so let's check out this
footage<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.480> enjoy

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.550 

okay<00:04:05.510> I'm<00:04:06.510> gonna<00:04:06.689> speak<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.049> little<00:04:07.200> bit<00:04:07.379> loud

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
okay I'm gonna speak a little bit loud

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
okay I'm gonna speak a little bit loud
just<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.610> case<00:04:08.790> my<00:04:09.090> voice<00:04:09.299> doesn't<00:04:09.540> come

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
just in case my voice doesn't come

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.770 
just in case my voice doesn't come
through<00:04:10.019> clearly<00:04:10.650> through<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:10.890> tape<00:04:11.689> like<00:04:12.689> I

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
through clearly through this tape like I

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.000 
through clearly through this tape like I
say<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> little<00:04:13.200> bit<00:04:13.409> windy<00:04:13.739> we'll<00:04:13.860> just

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
say a little bit windy we'll just

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.300 
say a little bit windy we'll just
perfect<00:04:14.400> perfect<00:04:14.879> for<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.299> test<00:04:15.949> as<00:04:16.949> you<00:04:17.100> can

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
perfect perfect for this test as you can

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.099 
perfect perfect for this test as you can
see<00:04:17.639> I'm<00:04:17.880> fighting<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.269> wind<00:04:18.449> just<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.900> little

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
see I'm fighting the wind just a little

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:29.430 
see I'm fighting the wind just a little
bit

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.170 

one<00:04:30.440> more<00:04:30.590> turn<00:04:31.240> stabilizer<00:04:36.669> all<00:04:37.669> right<00:04:37.940> so

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
one more turn stabilizer all right so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:52.200 
one more turn stabilizer all right so
here<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:38.479> go<00:04:41.410> stabilizer<00:04:42.410> is

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.870 

Wow<00:04:53.210> pretty<00:04:53.750> cool

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
Wow pretty cool

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.279 
Wow pretty cool
so<00:04:55.880> this<00:04:56.030> stabilizer<00:04:56.479> is<00:04:56.630> actually<00:04:57.020> working

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
so this stabilizer is actually working

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.060 
so this stabilizer is actually working
very<00:04:57.470> well<00:04:59.289> nice<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:00.530> steady

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
very well nice and steady

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.170 
very well nice and steady
against<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.490> plan

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.020 

I'm<00:05:08.180> very<00:05:08.449> impressed<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:10.220> these<00:05:10.580> pots<00:05:10.849> are

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
I'm very impressed and these pots are

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.290 
I'm very impressed and these pots are
diving<00:05:11.240> at<00:05:11.629> 50%<00:05:12.139> on<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.009> roll<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.729> yaw<00:05:13.940> and

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
diving at 50% on the roll the yaw and

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.320 
diving at 50% on the roll the yaw and
the<00:05:14.389> pitch<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.220> still<00:05:16.669> have<00:05:16.819> some<00:05:16.849> room<00:05:17.150> to

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
the pitch so I still have some room to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.369 
the pitch so I still have some room to
play<00:05:17.509> with<00:05:19.030> but<00:05:20.030> for<00:05:20.210> now<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.780> just<00:05:20.810> want<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.259> get

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:21.379 
play with but for now I just want to get

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.930 
play with but for now I just want to get
this<00:05:21.530> test<00:05:21.889> flight<00:05:22.009> out<00:05:24.550> but<00:05:25.550> right<00:05:25.699> where<00:05:25.849> it

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
this test flight out but right where it

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
this test flight out but right where it
is<00:05:26.000> right<00:05:26.210> now<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.419> looks<00:05:26.479> pretty<00:05:26.840> good

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
is right now it looks pretty good

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.860 
is right now it looks pretty good
actually<00:05:27.580> let's<00:05:28.580> turn<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.819> off<00:05:29.080> off<00:05:31.720> not<00:05:32.720> sure

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
actually let's turn it off off not sure

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.210 
actually let's turn it off off not sure
every<00:05:33.020> cop<00:05:33.259> as<00:05:33.500> soon<00:05:33.710> as<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:33.919> turn<00:05:34.129> the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
every cop as soon as I turn the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.570 
every cop as soon as I turn the
stabilizer<00:05:34.669> off<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:36.770> wind<00:05:37.009> picked<00:05:37.280> up<00:05:37.370> this

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
stabilizer off the wind picked up this

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:48.070 
stabilizer off the wind picked up this
aircraft<00:05:38.560> started<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:40.009> go<00:05:40.129> up<00:05:40.159> so<00:05:46.900> all<00:05:47.900> right

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
aircraft started to go up so all right

00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:01.330 
aircraft started to go up so all right
we're<00:05:48.409> back<00:05:48.590> on

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.870 

well<00:06:02.340> I'm<00:06:02.430> very<00:06:02.490> impressed<00:06:02.910> with<00:06:03.390> this

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
well I'm very impressed with this

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.640 
well I'm very impressed with this
quadcopter<00:06:05.880> board<00:06:06.480> and<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.990> open<00:06:07.440> arrow

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
quadcopter board and the open arrow

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.310 
quadcopter board and the open arrow
firmware

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.830 

it's<00:06:13.320> a<00:06:13.410> little<00:06:13.680> bit<00:06:13.830> so<00:06:14.070> that<00:06:14.250> could<00:06:14.400> be<00:06:14.430> a

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
it's a little bit so that could be a

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.920 
it's a little bit so that could be a
hitch<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.990> tuning<00:06:16.320> issue<00:06:16.610> but<00:06:17.780> it's<00:06:18.780> going

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
hitch the tuning issue but it's going

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.900 
hitch the tuning issue but it's going
against<00:06:19.260> the<00:06:19.350> wind<00:06:19.530> very<00:06:19.920> smooth<00:06:22.430> and<00:06:23.430> like<00:06:23.790> I

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
against the wind very smooth and like I

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.030 
against the wind very smooth and like I
said<00:06:24.150> we<00:06:24.330> have<00:06:24.510> 10<00:06:24.900> 20<00:06:25.380> mile<00:06:25.530> an<00:06:25.560> hour<00:06:25.710> winds

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
said we have 10 20 mile an hour winds

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:38.840 
said we have 10 20 mile an hour winds
right<00:06:26.340> now<00:06:26.370> which<00:06:27.360> is<00:06:27.480> a<00:06:27.540> good<00:06:27.750> day<00:06:37.850> it's

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
 bringing it a little bit low

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:52.590 
 bringing it a little bit low
here<00:06:42.140> against<00:06:43.140> the<00:06:43.290> wind

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.500

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
I'm gonna do one more flyby against the

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:12.159 
I'm gonna do one more flyby against the
wind<00:06:56.720> again<00:07:07.810> very<00:07:08.810> nice<00:07:10.600> I'm<00:07:11.600> gonna<00:07:11.780> bring<00:07:12.050> it
