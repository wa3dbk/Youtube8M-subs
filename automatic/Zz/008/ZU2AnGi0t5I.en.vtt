sucks<00:03:38.580> because<00:03:38.850> ps3<00:03:39.330> exclusives<00:03:39.900> usually

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
sucks because ps3 exclusives usually

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.740 
sucks because ps3 exclusives usually
have<00:03:40.590> like<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.770> background<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.430> them<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:42.660> like

have like a background to them just like

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.220 
have like a background to them just like
Wolfenstein<00:03:43.350> had<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:44.670> doesn't

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
Wolfenstein had but this one doesn't

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.260 
Wolfenstein had but this one doesn't
they<00:03:46.230> didn't<00:03:46.500> care<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.890> anyway<00:03:47.430> here's<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
they didn't care so anyway here's the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.830 
they didn't care so anyway here's the
front<00:03:48.420> again<00:03:48.770> here<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.070> back<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:51.420> he<00:03:51.750> has

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
front again here is the back and he has

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140 
front again here is the back and he has
the<00:03:52.020> side<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.310> don't<00:03:53.459> know<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:53.850> I'm<00:03:53.970> going<00:03:54.090> to

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
the side so I don't know if I'm going to

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.880 
the side so I don't know if I'm going to
review<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.630> game<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.080> probably<00:03:55.410> should

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.620 
been getting review grades so it's not
like<00:04:05.520> it's<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.760> game<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:05.970> no<00:04:06.270> one<00:04:06.300> gives<00:04:06.510> a

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.450 
days and also transistor came out which
I<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.950> play<00:04:20.160> too

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
a lot of games oh I mean that's good but

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.500 
a lot of games oh I mean that's good but
I<00:04:24.150> mean<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.660> good<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.900> bad

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
I mean it's good and bad

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.900 
I mean it's good and bad
a<00:04:25.540> lot<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.840> stuff<00:04:26.050> that's<00:04:26.800> going<00:04:26.950> on<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.850> I

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
a lot of stuff that's going on so if I

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.730 
a lot of stuff that's going on so if I
review<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.480> might<00:04:28.600> do<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> live<00:04:29.320> review<00:04:29.560> I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
review it I might do a live review I

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.380 
review it I might do a live review I
haven't<00:04:30.070> done<00:04:30.130> one<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.460> very<00:04:30.670> long<00:04:30.850> time<00:04:30.880> and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
haven't done one in a very long time and

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.550 
haven't done one in a very long time and
I<00:04:31.450> think<00:04:31.510> those<00:04:31.780> are<00:04:31.930> pretty<00:04:32.050> good<00:04:32.320> for<00:04:32.470> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
I think those are pretty good for the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.380 
I think those are pretty good for the
most<00:04:32.680> part<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.370> anyway<00:04:33.580> here<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:33.970> go<00:04:34.030> here's

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
my review I mean here's my unboxing for

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.410 
my review I mean here's my unboxing for
Dragon<00:04:36.670> guard<00:04:36.850> 2<00:04:37.060> 3<00:04:37.780> 3<00:04:38.380> then<00:04:38.740> play<00:04:38.950> -<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.700> there

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
Dragon guard 2 3 3 then play - so there

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.380 
Dragon guard 2 3 3 then play - so there
you<00:04:40.480> go<00:04:40.600> thank<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.260> goodbye
