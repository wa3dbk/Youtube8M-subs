00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
because it doesn't disturb the order now

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.459 
because it doesn't disturb the order now
you<00:01:56.759> say<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> need<00:01:57.479> three<00:01:57.990> paths<00:01:58.229> with

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
you say that you need three paths with

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.190 
you say that you need three paths with
three<00:01:58.649> cards<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.790> one<00:02:00.060> two<00:02:00.360> three<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.960> two

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
three one two three light so it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.800 
three one two three light so it
respected<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.360> shuffle<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
respected in one so you can shuffle the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.650 
respected in one so you can shuffle the
cards<00:02:07.610> like<00:02:08.610> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
cards like so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.280 
cards like so
and<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> first<00:02:12.060> pile<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:13.080> want

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and you take the first pile and you want

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.560 
and you take the first pile and you want
to<00:02:13.380> speculate<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.860> choose<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.310> card<00:02:14.640> let's<00:02:15.420> say

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.620 
to speculate to choose a card let's say
the<00:02:15.630> spectator<00:02:16.080> chooses<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.650> three<00:02:17.510> then<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the spectator chooses a three then the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.770 
the spectator chooses a three then the
middle<00:02:18.900> cut<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.850> last<00:02:20.880> cut<00:02:21.270> off<00:02:21.480> or

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
middle cut one and the last cut off or

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.040 
middle cut one and the last cut off or
and<00:02:21.990> if<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.440> look<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.210> 314<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.960> you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and if you look it's the 314 so you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.970 
and if you look it's the 314 so you
write<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.180> want<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.830> expected<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
write it then you want the expected to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.050 
write it then you want the expected to
do<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.400> same<00:02:29.580> thing<00:02:29.760> again<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.480> example<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:32.060> 76

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
do the same thing again for example a 76

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.350 
do the same thing again for example a 76
and<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:34.110> 2<00:02:35.000> 760<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.680> write<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.250> at<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.240> end

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and the 2 760 to write to and at the end

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.380 
and the 2 760 to write to and at the end
you<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.870> five<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:41.130> eight<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.210> nine

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you have a five and eight and the nine

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.300 
you have a five and eight and the nine
it's<00:02:43.160> 589<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.810> add<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.140> couch<00:02:46.320> you

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
it's 589 now if you add the couch you

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.310 
it's 589 now if you add the couch you
will<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:48.270> will<00:02:48.300> have<00:02:48.600> only<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> same

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
will you will have only the same

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.740 
will you will have only the same
solution<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:51.950> 1665<00:02:53.270> now<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.330> seem<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
solution it's 1665 now you seem to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.660 
solution it's 1665 now you seem to
expect<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.770> for<00:02:56.310> helper

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
expect in it that you have for helper

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.450 
expect in it that you have for helper
cards<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.900> deck<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> fight

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
cards in the deck and you have to fight

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.280 
cards in the deck and you have to fight
them<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.680> show<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.810> show<00:03:06.990> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
them so you show the one you show the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.470 
them so you show the one you show the
six<00:03:09.350> then<00:03:10.520> you're<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.730> show<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.120> auto

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
six then you're going to show the auto

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.350 
six then you're going to show the auto
six<00:03:13.160> right<00:03:14.160> here<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> end<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.810> show

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
six right here and at the end you show

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.870 
six right here and at the end you show
the<00:03:18.360> five<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:19.010> then<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.160> course<00:03:20.190> expected<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the five and then of course expected I

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
the five and then of course expected I
can<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.270> that<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:22.970> 1665<00:03:23.970> now<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
can see that you have for 1665 now you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
can see that you have for 1665 now you
explain<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> spectator<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.760> could

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
explain to the spectator that you could

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.660 
explain to the spectator that you could
switch<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> cards<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.650> make<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:29.040> different<00:03:29.520> a

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
switch the cards to make a different a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.880 
switch the cards to make a different a
different<00:03:29.730> solution<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.690> then<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.860> end

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
different solution and then at the end

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.460 
different solution and then at the end
of<00:03:32.010> three<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.820> trick<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.170> have<00:03:34.350> to
