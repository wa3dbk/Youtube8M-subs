00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.290
 all word the successful veteran room 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.330
 strategy developed by the creative 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.550
 assembly of the jump to the genre of the free 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.440
 to play with total good sand a title 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 free for pc that currently 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.680
 found in closed alpha phase in the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.920
 that here we bring you some first 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.920
 impressions 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.100
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.660
 highlight is that we are facing a game 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.580
 focused completely on the battles 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.230
 multiplayer that in a certain way it 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.060
 resembles the online mode that 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.010
 we have seen in other titles of the series 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.080
 although with a big difference since the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.000
 total war sand we will participate nothing 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.650
 less than in games of a total of 20 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.180
 players that will split in two 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.180
 teams of 10 with radios 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 in addition another very striking feature 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 that during the battles each player 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 commands only three units of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.509
 army thus adding each team a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 total of 30 battalions which implies 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.810
 that it is a title in which the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.240
 cooperation is essential to obtain 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.009
 victory being very important 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.509
 coordinate with the other members of 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.310
 our side when it comes to planning and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.820
 carry out a good strategy of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820
 Cáceres 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.799
 in this sense before each game 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.510
 we must choose three types of troops 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.310
 we will take to the battle and for it 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.140
 we will have to select a faction and a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 commander since each of these 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 they have units of skills 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.140
 unique more exactly at the moment we have 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 could see three big features 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 in the case of the Roman Empire which 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.619
 Commander has Julius Caesar 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.110
 Germanic and the split in African 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.119
 barbarians led by watching 15 tonics and 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.310
 Armenian and finally the Greeks who 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.030
 they have leonidas milcíades and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.030
 Alexander the Great 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.060
 on the other hand as for the troops that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.980
 we can take to the battle these 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.510
 they can be of several kinds although all 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.550
 they are included in four types 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.580
 main the swordsmen the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.050
 lancers the cavalry in artillery yes 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.390
 well at the beginning of the game only 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.800
 we will have the most basic units 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.540
 and from there we should go 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.070
 getting the rest by means of a 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.660
 technology tree in which 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.800
 unlock we will make improvements that make 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.800
 evolve the troops 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.570
 to me 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.580
 this system to give an example 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.620
 is very similar to the system 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.750
 improvements to titles such as world of tanks 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.790
 having units that go from workshops 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.130
 like the militiamen and the respirators 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.050
 until we get to say 10 where we 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.880
 we will find with authentic troops of 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.040
 elite as the Roman imperial guard 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.000
 the devastating onagro just always 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.000
 fierce spartans 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.490
 focusing now a little more on the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.260
 game mechanics we tell you that at 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.270
 start of the battle each player can 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.620
 choose where on the map you want 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.710
 outgoing among the available options 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.390
 for each side once in the 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.190
 In the heat of battle the objective will be 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.080
 capture the base of the rival team to the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.530
 Once we prevent these conquer in 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.530
 ours 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.440
 in this aspect the component 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.390
 strategic is very important since the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.159
 maps are quite broad and there are several 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.620
 routes that we can follow to devote to 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.330
 the same destination we can also 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.159
 take advantage of the forests and others 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.019
 elements of the scenario to hide to 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.560
 our troops and thus take advantage of the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.560
 surprise factor 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.710
 In addition, each battle can only last one 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.360
 maximum of 15 minutes so if the 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.340
 time runs out before you can 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.410
 capture some of the bases will win the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.450
 departure to the team at that time have 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.640
 a greater number of troops still alive 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.230
 something quite successful as this avoids 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.390
 that both sides adopt an attitude 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.190
 purely defensive that could 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.200
 spoil the pace of the action or do 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.120
 the boring departure always becoming 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.420
 at least one of them forced to carry 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.420
 the initiative 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.000
 phil ricci 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.780
 and before we finish we tell you that the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.430
 graphic section of the coconut looks great 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.050
 having little to envy to the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.300
 any other installment of the total saga 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.980
 war having especially liked the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.930
 great the design of the scenarios 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.880
 which have several levels of 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.980
 height and they promote a lot the power to plan 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.840
 diverse strategies while in what 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.910
 Regarding the modeling of the units 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.740
 they fulfill correctly, although if 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.390
 is missing a level of detail something 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.390
 greater when we bring the camera closer 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.730
 in summary this first contact with everything 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.920
 some sand has left us very good 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.080
 taste of mouth trying to be successful what 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.640
 He promises to go a long way especially if 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.950
 we take into account towards the genre that 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.010
 the rt this does not have too many 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.420
 games based on the free to play model 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.250
 we have to remember that he is still in 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.140
 alpha phase so we hope they said 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.970
 polishing some elements that should be 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.770
 improved for its launch in 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.770
 open planned for this year
