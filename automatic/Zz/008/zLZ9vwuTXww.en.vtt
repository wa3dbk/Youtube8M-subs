00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.859 
wait I don't deal with getting Stone
Edge<00:01:31.650> rocks<00:01:32.040> lid<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:32.970> flygon

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
Edge rocks lid so I just go into flygon

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
Edge rocks lid so I just go into flygon
to<00:01:34.049> take<00:01:34.200> both<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.280> gonna<00:01:35.400> go

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to take both that and I'm now gonna go

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
to take both that and I'm now gonna go
for<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.700> earthquake<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:36.900> thought

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
for the earthquake and I really thought

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.069 
for the earthquake and I really thought
that<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.409> gonna<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.130> uh<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
that was gonna do a little more uh I

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.969 
that was gonna do a little more uh I
hoping<00:01:40.079> he'd<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.680> special

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
hoping he'd be more like special

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.859 
hoping he'd be more like special
defensives<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.030> registeel<00:01:42.720> can

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
defensives I know I know registeel can

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
defensives I know I know registeel can
be<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.110> defensive<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.159> defensive<00:01:44.490> but

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
be so defensive but he was defensive but

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.179 
be so defensive but he was defensive but
either<00:01:45.750> way<00:01:46.020> he's<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> switch<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.159> don't

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
either way he's got a switch I don't

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.319 
either way he's got a switch I don't
even<00:01:47.399> wanna<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.820> he<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> perfect

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
even wanna think if he has a perfect

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.240 
even wanna think if he has a perfect
actually<00:01:48.689> perfect<00:01:49.590> counter<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.399> perfect<00:01:51.329> wall

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
actually perfect counter or perfect wall

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
actually perfect counter or perfect wall

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
before my flag on that is that is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.399 
before my flag on that is that is
tangrowth<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:56.610> takes<00:01:56.880> absolutely<00:01:57.409> nothing

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
tangrowth which takes absolutely nothing

from that flag on so I got a pic we

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.760 
from that flag on so I got a pic we
gotta<00:02:00.090> switch<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.229> back<00:02:01.380> into<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> V

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
gotta switch now so go back into the V

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.080 
gotta switch now so go back into the V
