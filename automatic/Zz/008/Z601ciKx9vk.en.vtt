 If it proves that it goes, it will be said that the fluorescent dye which is said to be all cold green called follow cold war 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:30.300

 Of course the red color, orange color, keys and so on are all actually made 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.540
 I'd have been in a state such as is still often frequently used the original of Tteyuu the green 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.290
 It's already so other colors 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.290
 The current situation was that fluorescent dyes like this were not made yet 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.360

 One task is to give the red pigment a function 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:28.830
 So we developed this time the concept of Nase Beta Garacta City 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.500
 We developed something to detect and shine 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.370

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.540

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:44.320
 I developed it as a base 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.010
 In addition to that, to develop this red pigment that is now targeted to another molecule 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.920
 By 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.820
 Both what it is to have a function, such as to censor the different substances that come out the original car 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.550
 By using 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.730
 It is possible to diagnose pathologically original origin from two aspects 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.500
 I think that it should be a tool

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:22.400
 In the future, various fluorescent probes using this trend 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:28.340
 We are developing fluorescent probes that capture so-called various biomolecules 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.340
 Well something more complicated in the body is in a state that I do not know well what is happening 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.290
 I want to elucidate with a new approach 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.140
 After all well in the future 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.849
 After all because it is the Faculty of Pharmacy now, it is for the diagnostic medicine using such things or such medical treatment 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.560
 To say to lead such a development 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.769
 I do not know how many decades it will be, but I thought that I would like to do it in the near future 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.769
 I will
