and while I don't think I am ready for
that<00:00:32.219> yet<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.610> decided<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> heck<00:00:34.140> for

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that yet I decided what the heck for

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.490 
that yet I decided what the heck for
2,000<00:00:35.309> subscribers<00:00:35.460> i<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.750> gaming

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
2,000 subscribers i will make a gaming

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.639 
2,000 subscribers i will make a gaming
video<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.100> i<00:00:39.030> picked<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.899> game<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> i<00:00:40.379> don't

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
video and i picked a game that i don't

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
video and i picked a game that i don't
know<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> whole<00:00:40.980> lot<00:00:41.040> about<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:42.059> thought

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
know a whole lot about and i thought

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.580 
know a whole lot about and i thought
this<00:00:42.420> game<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:42.780> fit<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.230> channel

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
this game would fit this channel

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
this game would fit this channel
perfectly<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.480> probably<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> only

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
perfectly so this is probably the only

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
perfectly so this is probably the only
gaming<00:00:46.410> video<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> make<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.730> this
