00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.080
 tried to reinvent different 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.060
 ways the open world game 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.320
 The game world is wonderful 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 gigantic and varied 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.880
 a satirical and immense version of 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.210
 modern south california 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.570
 with seas and mountains luxury shops and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.120
 shopping centers urban decadence and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 virgin nature beaches and areas 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.989
 isolated the sublime and the ridiculous 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.089
 greed and hypocrisy of telmex a clean 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 what you want I will return it body reads 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.460
 explain you why not be one 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.050
 for the first time the game does not have 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.879
 a single aspiring hero but with 3 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.830
 maikel in his day a successful robber of 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.979
 banks and today a not so successful father of 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.979
 family 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.700
 franklin a street hustler 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.700
 convinced to be surrounded by imbeciles 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:27.689
 it's the dog and then this test 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.689
 The less we say of him, the better 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.870
 thanks to the three protagonists 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.270
 they remodel both the narration in a 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.880
 interlaced history as the structure 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 of individual missions 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 players can alternate between 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.789
 perspectives and move on from an instant 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.789
 dizzying to another 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.340
 and he knew 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.230
 and this allows missions 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.710
 acquire new levels of diversity and 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.710
 intensity 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.060
 outside of a mission the use of three 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.989
 protagonists also allows adding a 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.239
 touch of voyeurism since you can 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.370
 find out when you want in 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.370
 that your new friends have been involved 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.900
 two 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.600
 the world is not only huge but it is 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.470
 full of things to see and do 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.130
 customize cars piloting aircraft 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.840

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.790
 animals hunt and be hunted rare types 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.250
 collect rewards and much more 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.040

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.579
 yes 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.480
 There has also been a lot of emphasis on 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.340
 game mechanics so that all your 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.060
 aspects are so fun and fluid 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.060
 as broad 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.750
 and everything either drive and shoot 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.400
 or tennis and riding a bike results 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.620
 fun and interactive 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 however in addition to engaging in leisure 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.870
 people should also address their 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.280
 business for all your pretensions 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.280
 These men are dangerous thieves 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.099
 and to survive they have to plan 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.709
 and perform a series of blows each 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.769
 more audacious times 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.290
 are the players plan for themselves 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.069
 themselves and then decide how and with whom 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.069
 execute them 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.170
 I 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.009
 the booty you decide on what to spend the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.690
 money from sensible investments like 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.690
 tattoos and fast cars 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.380
 to risky projects like actions and 

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:37.890
 properties in the saints 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.880
