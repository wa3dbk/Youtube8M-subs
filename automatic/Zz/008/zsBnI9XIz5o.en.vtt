00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.460 
that it's not too bad of a hood and when
he<00:02:09.989> had<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
he had it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.760 
he had it
I<00:02:10.500> saw<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> had<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:12.050> gears<00:02:13.050> for<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.530> gear

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I saw it had the gears for the gear

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.670 
I saw it had the gears for the gear
reduction<00:02:14.220> wheels<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.000> pinion<00:02:15.330> gears<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.470> I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
reduction wheels the pinion gears and I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.170 
reduction wheels the pinion gears and I
asked<00:02:16.980> him<00:02:17.069> whether<00:02:17.220> he<00:02:17.400> had<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> hubs<00:02:17.819> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
asked him whether he had the hubs and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.449 
asked him whether he had the hubs and
turns<00:02:18.930> out<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.319> he<00:02:19.440> did<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.280> my

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
turns out that he did so I have my

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.259 
turns out that he did so I have my
fourth<00:02:20.849> set<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.480> gear<00:02:22.019> reduction<00:02:22.500> wheels<00:02:23.269> I'll

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
fourth set of gear reduction wheels I'll

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.720 
fourth set of gear reduction wheels I'll
get<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> them<00:02:24.660> later<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:26.040> missing<00:02:26.430> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
get to them later but it is missing the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.400 
get to them later but it is missing the
pto<00:02:27.030> stuff<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.660> Front's<00:02:28.019> missing<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
pto stuff and the Front's missing the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.559 
pto stuff and the Front's missing the
dog<00:02:28.620> gear<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.640> shipper<00:02:29.880> shaft<00:02:30.239> you're<00:02:30.480> on

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
dog gear in the shipper shaft you're on

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.750 
dog gear in the shipper shaft you're on
top<00:02:30.900> when<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> got<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.040> when<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.280> got<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.730> was

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
top when I got it when I got it it was

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.339 
top when I got it when I got it it was
covered<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.300> grease<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.870> either<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> good

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
covered in grease like either the good

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.170 
covered in grease like either the good
path<00:02:34.620> clubs<00:02:35.040> everything<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.580> cleaned<00:02:35.850> up<00:02:36.000> real

path clubs everything up cleaned up real

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.990 
path clubs everything up cleaned up real
nice<00:02:36.739> had<00:02:37.739> electric<00:02:38.190> start<00:02:38.519> on<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:38.850> one

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
nice had electric start on it at one

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.009 
nice had electric start on it at one
point<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:40.650> think<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.150> 6.6<00:02:42.150> horse<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
point and I think it's a 6.6 horse the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.690 
point and I think it's a 6.6 horse the
only<00:02:43.200> problem<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> spin<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
only problem with it is you can spin the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210 
only problem with it is you can spin the
engine<00:02:45.000> over<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.590> knocking

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
engine over and you get that knocking

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.729 
engine over and you get that knocking
inside<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.239> piston<00:02:48.599> doesn't<00:02:48.870> move<00:02:49.049> so<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
inside in the piston doesn't move so the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.400 
inside in the piston doesn't move so the
connecting<00:02:50.310> rod<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.849> broken<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:52.110> off<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
connecting rod is broken it's off to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.780 
connecting rod is broken it's off to
take<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.680> out<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> parts<00:02:53.190> engine<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.640> throw

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
take it out of a parts engine and throw

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.089 
take it out of a parts engine and throw
one<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:55.290> missing<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.680> couple<00:02:55.709> of

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
one in there it's missing a couple of

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.130 
one in there it's missing a couple of
the<00:02:56.250> oil<00:02:56.400> lines<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.180> rear<00:02:57.330> hitch<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.720> outside

the oil lines the rear hitch is outside
missing<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.709> magneto<00:02:59.099> carburetor<00:03:00.590> he's<00:03:01.590> helped

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
missing a magneto carburetor he's helped

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.289 
missing a magneto carburetor he's helped
me<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.099> fold<00:03:02.310> was<00:03:02.459> braised<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.940> one<00:03:03.060> point

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
me in the fold was braised at one point

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.920 
me in the fold was braised at one point
but<00:03:03.599> all<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.290> all<00:03:04.380> intact<00:03:04.769> which<00:03:05.069> is<00:03:05.190> nice<00:03:05.930> so

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
but all in all intact which is nice so

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.960 
but all in all intact which is nice so
that's<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.230> good<00:03:07.440> shape<00:03:07.709> for<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.010> most<00:03:08.220> part<00:03:08.579> so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
that's a good shape for the most part so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.210 
that's a good shape for the most part so
hopefully<00:03:09.320> winter<00:03:10.320> project<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:10.980> there<00:03:11.190> I

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
hopefully winter project right there I

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
hopefully winter project right there I
can<00:03:11.459> get<00:03:11.609> it<00:03:11.700> all<00:03:11.820> back<00:03:12.000> together<00:03:12.209> running

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
can get it all back together running

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.620 
can get it all back together running
which<00:03:13.170> would<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.380> really<00:03:13.560> nice<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:15.329> as<00:03:15.450> for

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
which would be really nice and as for

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.430 
which would be really nice and as for
the<00:03:15.720> gear<00:03:15.870> reduction<00:03:16.290> wheels<00:03:18.260> here's<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
the gear reduction wheels here's the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.190 
the gear reduction wheels here's the
ones<00:03:19.620> they<00:03:20.100> have<00:03:20.250> brand<00:03:20.910> new<00:03:21.150> tires<00:03:21.780> and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
ones they have brand new tires and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.530 
ones they have brand new tires and
wheels<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.950> them<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.760> only<00:03:23.910> thing<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.299> that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
wheels on them the only thing is that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.710 
wheels on them the only thing is that
figures<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.260> someone<00:03:25.709> cut<00:03:26.010> tire<00:03:26.790> tread<00:03:27.239> to

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
figures that someone cut tire tread to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.870 
figures that someone cut tire tread to
go<00:03:27.900> past<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.620> starter<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.310> tractor

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
go past the starter on the tractor

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.849 
go past the starter on the tractor
because<00:03:30.569> these<00:03:30.959> are<00:03:31.170> actually<00:03:31.530> bigger<00:03:31.739> than

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
because these are actually bigger than

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.860 
because these are actually bigger than
the<00:03:32.549> gear<00:03:33.030> reduction<00:03:33.420> wheel<00:03:33.540> size<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.620> our<00:03:35.870> 12

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the gear reduction wheel size is our 12

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.390 
the gear reduction wheel size is our 12
inch<00:03:36.989> rims<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.590> think<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.859> gear<00:03:38.040> reduction

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
inch rims and I think the gear reduction

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.090 
inch rims and I think the gear reduction
wheels<00:03:38.579> are<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.389> little<00:03:39.959> bit<00:03:40.109> smaller<00:03:40.500> or<00:03:40.829> they

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
wheels are a little bit smaller or they

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.500 
wheels are a little bit smaller or they
just<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.400> smaller<00:03:41.700> tires<00:03:42.030> because<00:03:42.450> these

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
just have smaller tires because these

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.680 
just have smaller tires because these
are<00:03:42.690> really<00:03:42.900> big<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:43.889> they're<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> nice<00:03:44.310> shape

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
are really big but they're a nice shape

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.030 
are really big but they're a nice shape
they<00:03:45.690> really<00:03:45.959> boy<00:03:46.170> Liam<00:03:46.410> stuff<00:03:46.709> but<00:03:46.859> that's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
they really boy Liam stuff but that's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.170 
they really boy Liam stuff but that's
fine<00:03:47.280> because<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.609> have<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.880> leave<00:03:48.030> them

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
fine because I have to leave them

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.300 
fine because I have to leave them
outside<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:51.150> I've<00:03:51.540> got<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> nice<00:03:52.010> another<00:03:53.010> set

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
outside so I've got a nice another set

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.890 
outside so I've got a nice another set
key<00:03:53.579> reduction<00:03:54.000> wheels<00:03:54.180> not<00:03:54.450> too<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:54.750> what's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
key reduction wheels not too so what's

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.069 
key reduction wheels not too so what's
gonna<00:03:55.079> happen<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> him<00:03:55.709> yet<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:57.569> as<00:03:57.780> for<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079

and as Foulke a compression but not the
greatest<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:09.190> he<00:05:09.280> stopped<00:05:09.580> using<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:10.120> because

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
greatest and he stopped using it because

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.480 
greatest and he stopped using it because
the<00:05:10.599> exhaust<00:05:11.020> manifold<00:05:11.530> snapped<00:05:11.889> off<00:05:12.160> of<00:05:12.340> it

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
the exhaust manifold snapped off of it

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.820 
the exhaust manifold snapped off of it
and<00:05:13.000> actually<00:05:13.330> this<00:05:13.870> year<00:05:13.930> over<00:05:14.380> here<00:05:14.680> was

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
and actually this year over here was

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.040 
and actually this year over here was
left<00:05:15.039> on<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.430> but<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> cut<00:05:15.820> that<00:05:15.970> off<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.270> bolt

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
left on it but I cut that off and bolt

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.540 
left on it but I cut that off and bolt
broke<00:05:17.320> because<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.620> wasn't<00:05:17.830> much<00:05:17.949> left<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.430> it

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
broke because it wasn't much left to it

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.939 
broke because it wasn't much left to it
so<00:05:18.699> if<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.880> drill<00:05:19.150> those<00:05:19.300> out<00:05:19.539> and<00:05:20.110> I<00:05:20.800> got<00:05:20.889> a

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
so if the drill those out and I got a

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.529 
so if the drill those out and I got a
spare<00:05:21.310> exhaust<00:05:21.639> manifold<00:05:22.150> in<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.300> drawer

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
spare exhaust manifold in the drawer

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.680 
spare exhaust manifold in the drawer
that<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.750> can<00:05:22.930> throw<00:05:23.110> on<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.349> it's<00:05:23.919> just<00:05:23.979> good<00:05:24.690> so

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
that I can throw on it it's just good so

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.879 
that I can throw on it it's just good so
hopefully<00:05:25.780> I'll<00:05:26.139> have<00:05:26.260> this<00:05:26.470> one<00:05:26.680> running

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
hopefully I'll have this one running

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.600 
hopefully I'll have this one running
soon<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:28.300> then<00:05:28.419> I'll<00:05:28.539> have<00:05:28.659> any<00:05:28.870> completeness

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
soon and then I'll have any completeness

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.850 
soon and then I'll have any completeness
model<00:05:30.610> he'll<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.930> from<00:05:32.289> what<00:05:32.409> he<00:05:32.500> said<00:05:32.740> it

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
model he'll and from what he said it

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.140 
model he'll and from what he said it
didn't<00:05:33.070> really<00:05:33.190> smoke<00:05:33.310> or<00:05:33.699> anything<00:05:33.849> which

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
didn't really smoke or anything which

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.580 
didn't really smoke or anything which
was<00:05:34.300> good<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:39.190> carburetor<00:05:40.229> which<00:05:41.229> is<00:05:41.349> right

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
was good and carburetor which is right

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.159 
was good and carburetor which is right
here<00:05:41.970> actually<00:05:42.970> not<00:05:43.270> as<00:05:43.360> bad<00:05:43.389> as<00:05:43.720> I<00:05:43.810> figured

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
here actually not as bad as I figured

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.070 
here actually not as bad as I figured
with<00:05:44.320> rust<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:44.800> stuff<00:05:44.919> in<00:05:45.220> there<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.780> it's

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
with rust and stuff in there and it's

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.529 
with rust and stuff in there and it's
salvageable<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:48.669> can<00:05:48.789> get<00:05:48.909> that<00:05:49.030> cleaned<00:05:49.389> up

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
salvageable so I can get that cleaned up

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.740 
salvageable so I can get that cleaned up
and<00:05:49.659> back<00:05:49.720> on<00:05:50.080> there<00:05:50.320> the<00:05:51.099> governor<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.729> got<00:05:52.599> the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
and back on there the governor I got the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.200 
and back on there the governor I got the
other<00:05:53.169> part<00:05:53.530> inside<00:05:53.860> got<00:05:54.370> to<00:05:54.460> get<00:05:54.580> a<00:05:54.610> seal<00:05:54.880> for

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
other part inside got to get a seal for

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.529 
other part inside got to get a seal for
it<00:05:55.360> but<00:05:56.169> I<00:05:56.409> think<00:05:56.820> someone<00:05:57.820> put<00:05:58.030> a<00:05:58.090> brand<00:05:58.449> new

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
it but I think someone put a brand new

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.330 
it but I think someone put a brand new
governor<00:05:59.020> on<00:05:59.139> this<00:05:59.320> when<00:05:59.440> they<00:05:59.530> repaint<00:05:59.889> if

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
governor on this when they repaint if

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.230 
governor on this when they repaint if
you<00:06:00.430> look<00:06:00.580> at<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.759> pulley

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
you look at the pulley

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.390 
you look at the pulley
it's<00:06:01.720> got<00:06:01.870> no<00:06:02.020> rust<00:06:02.289> on<00:06:02.470> it<00:06:02.650> it's<00:06:02.949> got<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.130> little

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
it's got no rust on it it's got a little

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.700 
it's got no rust on it it's got a little
bit<00:06:03.520> of<00:06:03.639> overspray<00:06:04.000> of<00:06:04.300> red<00:06:04.570> no<00:06:05.199> rust<00:06:05.440> on<00:06:05.590> the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
bit of overspray of red no rust on the

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.920 
bit of overspray of red no rust on the
backside<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:06.430> almost<00:06:07.090> nowhere<00:06:07.389> on<00:06:07.840> the

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
backside and almost nowhere on the

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.890 
backside and almost nowhere on the
inside<00:06:08.699> really<00:06:09.699> no<00:06:09.909> slop<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.479> it<00:06:10.599> and<00:06:10.780> the

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
inside really no slop in it and the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.350 
inside really no slop in it and the
other<00:06:11.020> half<00:06:11.289> the<00:06:12.099> cover<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:12.820> goes<00:06:13.030> over<00:06:13.180> the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
other half the cover that goes over the

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.320 
other half the cover that goes over the
back<00:06:13.539> is<00:06:13.780> almost<00:06:13.960> no<00:06:14.259> slop<00:06:14.560> in<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:14.830> either

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
back is almost no slop in it either

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.170 
back is almost no slop in it either
there's<00:06:16.330> really<00:06:16.479> nowhere<00:06:16.720> on<00:06:17.320> the<00:06:17.530> fork<00:06:18.180> and

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
there's really nowhere on the fork and

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.850 
there's really nowhere on the fork and
this<00:06:19.360> one<00:06:19.539> was<00:06:19.690> covered<00:06:20.020> with<00:06:20.050> rust<00:06:20.409> luckily

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
this one was covered with rust luckily

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.790 
this one was covered with rust luckily
there<00:06:21.039> was<00:06:21.159> oil<00:06:21.370> in<00:06:22.270> it<00:06:22.389> so<00:06:22.539> it<00:06:23.229> wasn't<00:06:23.500> too<00:06:23.620> bad

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
there was oil in it so it wasn't too bad

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.920 
there was oil in it so it wasn't too bad
inside<00:06:24.219> I<00:06:24.550> was<00:06:24.880> able<00:06:24.969> to<00:06:25.180> flush<00:06:25.479> it<00:06:25.630> out<00:06:25.719> the

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
inside I was able to flush it out the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.450 
inside I was able to flush it out the
spins<00:06:26.200> over<00:06:26.380> nice

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
spins over nice

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.670 
spins over nice
so<00:06:27.550> I'll<00:06:27.640> have<00:06:27.790> another<00:06:28.260> nice<00:06:29.260> working

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
so I'll have another nice working

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.350 
so I'll have another nice working
governor<00:06:29.980> for<00:06:30.400> a<00:06:30.430> project<00:06:30.970> if<00:06:31.060> I<00:06:31.150> go<00:06:31.300> to

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
governor for a project if I go to

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.990 
governor for a project if I go to
restore<00:06:31.750> something<00:06:32.200> which<00:06:32.380> I<00:06:32.560> got<00:06:32.770> a<00:06:32.950> box<00:06:33.820> of
