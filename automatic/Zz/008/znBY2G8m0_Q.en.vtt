00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.370 

now<00:00:18.119> I'll<00:00:18.240> tell<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.570> little<00:00:18.720> bit<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
now I'll tell you a little bit about the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.880 
now I'll tell you a little bit about the
corrals

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
corrals

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
corrals
the<00:00:20.340> first<00:00:20.609> interesting<00:00:21.180> fact<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> coral

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the first interesting fact is the coral

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
the first interesting fact is the coral
is<00:00:22.199> actually<00:00:22.560> an<00:00:22.650> animal<00:00:23.130> not<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.369> plant<00:00:23.789> which

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is actually an animal not a plant which

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.060 
is actually an animal not a plant which
really<00:00:24.630> spins<00:00:25.080> people<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:25.800> they

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
really spins people out because they

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.939 
really spins people out because they
look<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.269> cosmic<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.869> they're<00:00:28.080> coral<00:00:28.439> being

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
look so cosmic but they're coral being

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
look so cosmic but they're coral being
an<00:00:29.130> animal<00:00:29.460> does<00:00:29.939> actually<00:00:30.179> rely<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.810> little

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
an animal does actually rely on little

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
an animal does actually rely on little
algie's<00:00:31.710> called<00:00:32.009> zoo<00:00:32.250> anthalie<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.059> grow

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
algie's called zoo anthalie that grow

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
algie's called zoo anthalie that grow
within<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.899> coral<00:00:34.260> which<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.980> only<00:00:35.250> give<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
within the coral which not only give the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.389 
within the coral which not only give the
coral<00:00:35.940> its<00:00:36.090> color<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.930> allows<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.590> coral<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
coral its color but allows the coral to

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.180 
coral its color but allows the coral to
use<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.940> light<00:00:39.270> energy<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.440> actual<00:00:40.770> food

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
use the light energy as an actual food

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.819 
use the light energy as an actual food
source<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.969> basically<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.260> coral<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.680> an

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
source so basically the coral is an

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
source so basically the coral is an
animal<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.579> coral<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.300> algie's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
animal the coral has the little algie's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.799 
animal the coral has the little algie's
within<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:47.039> rely<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.489> light<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.510> must

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
within it which rely on light so we must

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
within it which rely on light so we must
have<00:00:49.020> enough<00:00:49.289> light<00:00:49.530> we<00:00:50.039> also<00:00:50.219> must<00:00:50.579> have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
have enough light we also must have

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
have enough light we also must have
enough<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.329> flow<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.199> wash<00:00:52.410> away<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> waste

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
enough water flow to wash away the waste

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.430 
enough water flow to wash away the waste
from<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> coal<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> also<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> bring<00:00:55.199> new

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
from the coal and also to bring new

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.580 
from the coal and also to bring new
nutrients<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> coral<00:00:56.699> itself<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.539> coral<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
nutrients to the coral itself a coral is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
nutrients to the coral itself a coral is
a<00:00:58.620> sense<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.219> organism<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.390> means<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
a sense all organism which means it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
a sense all organism which means it
can't<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.559> move<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.760> wherever<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
can't actually move so wherever you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
can't actually move so wherever you
position<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> coral<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> aquarium<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
position the coral in the aquarium is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
position the coral in the aquarium is
where<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.729> pretty<00:01:05.909> much<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> stay<00:01:06.570> on

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
where it's pretty much going to stay on

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
where it's pretty much going to stay on
the<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.070> hand<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:08.850> fungus<00:01:09.570> which

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the other hand there's also fungus which

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
the other hand there's also fungus which
looked<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> coral<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.159> excrete

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
looked just like a coral and excrete

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.660 
looked just like a coral and excrete
calcium<00:01:12.600> carbonate<00:01:13.140> bases<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.369> can

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
calcium carbonate bases but they can

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.450 
calcium carbonate bases but they can
move<00:01:14.970> along<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> bottom<00:01:15.799> there's<00:01:16.799> also<00:01:17.100> an

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
move along the bottom there's also an

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
move along the bottom there's also an
enemies<00:01:17.850> which<00:01:18.090> look<00:01:18.299> similar<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.869> fungus<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
enemies which look similar to fungus and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560 
enemies which look similar to fungus and
the<00:01:20.100> antenna<00:01:20.340> mieze<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> soft<00:01:21.210> foot

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the antenna mieze have got a soft foot

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
the antenna mieze have got a soft foot
and<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.500> excrete<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> calcium

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and they don't excrete the calcium

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
and they don't excrete the calcium
carbonate<00:01:24.060> base<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.350> move

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
carbonate base and they can move

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.490 
carbonate base and they can move
anywhere<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.490> around<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.939> aquarium

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
anywhere they want around the aquarium

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
anywhere they want around the aquarium
including<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> walls<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> sides<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
including up the walls and the sides of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359 
including up the walls and the sides of
the<00:01:30.090> aquarium<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> enemies<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.189> not

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the aquarium but the enemies are not

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.170 
the aquarium but the enemies are not
corals

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
corals

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.840 
corals
there's<00:01:33.659> also<00:01:33.869> starfish<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.950> urgent's<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
there's also starfish and urgent's and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
there's also starfish and urgent's and
cucumbers<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.619> things

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
cucumbers and all these other things

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010 
cucumbers and all these other things
that<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.400> put<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.090> reef<00:01:39.390> aquarium

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that you can put into your reef aquarium

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.560 
that you can put into your reef aquarium
which<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.530> beside<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.460> coral<00:01:41.850> themselves

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
which are beside the coral themselves

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.080 
which are beside the coral themselves
the<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.560> main<00:01:43.829> types<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.430> corals<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.909> you're

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the two main types of corals that you're

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
the two main types of corals that you're
likely<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.689> involved<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.710> soft<00:01:47.159> corals

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
likely to be involved in are soft corals

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.719 
likely to be involved in are soft corals
and<00:01:47.880> hard<00:01:48.570> corals<00:01:49.110> basically<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> hard<00:01:50.310> coral

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and hard corals basically a hard coral

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
and hard corals basically a hard coral
is<00:01:50.880> any<00:01:51.060> coral<00:01:51.450> retracts<00:01:52.049> into<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.950> hard

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is any coral retracts into a hard

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.719 
is any coral retracts into a hard
calcium<00:01:54.329> carbonate<00:01:54.960> base<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.340> other<00:01:56.490> hand

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
calcium carbonate base on the other hand

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.480 
calcium carbonate base on the other hand
a<00:01:56.820> soft<00:01:57.119> coral<00:01:57.540> will<00:01:57.899> either<00:01:58.140> contract<00:01:59.070> or

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
a soft coral will either contract or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.840 
a soft coral will either contract or
droop<00:01:59.880> over<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.899> into<00:02:01.229> itself<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:02.399> into<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
droop over that into itself not into a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.630 
droop over that into itself not into a
hard<00:02:03.390> calcium<00:02:03.990> carbonate<00:02:04.500> base<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
hard calcium carbonate base so when a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300 
hard calcium carbonate base so when a
soft<00:02:06.090> coral<00:02:06.420> dies<00:02:06.600> nothing<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.829> basically

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
soft coral dies nothing is basically

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.729

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
thing is the position of this tub of

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.910 
thing is the position of this tub of
pora

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
pora

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.309 
pora
now<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:02.519> all<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.760> these<00:04:03.030> really<00:04:03.690> porous

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
now with all of these really porous

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.199 
now with all of these really porous
corals<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.519> got<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.670> very<00:04:05.850> porous

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
corals that have got a very porous

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.120 
corals that have got a very porous
structure<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.870> them<00:04:07.019> it's<00:04:07.410> really<00:04:07.739> important

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
structure to them it's really important

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.500 
structure to them it's really important
they<00:04:08.220> don't<00:04:08.370> build<00:04:08.609> up<00:04:08.819> with<00:04:09.000> sediment

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
they don't build up with sediment

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.240 
they don't build up with sediment
because<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.440> will<00:04:10.590> find<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:10.980> when<00:04:11.069> they

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
because you will find that when they

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.069 
because you will find that when they
build<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.579> with<00:04:11.700> sediment<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.510> they<00:04:12.660> tend<00:04:12.959> to

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
build up with sediment that they tend to

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.590 
build up with sediment that they tend to
gather<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.130> nitrifying<00:04:14.639> bacteria<00:04:14.670> within

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
gather the nitrifying bacteria within

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.569 
gather the nitrifying bacteria within
them<00:04:15.780> which<00:04:15.959> can<00:04:16.260> slowly<00:04:16.889> release<00:04:17.310> hydrogen

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
them which can slowly release hydrogen

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.640 
them which can slowly release hydrogen
sulfide<00:04:18.389> which<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.840> cause<00:04:18.989> obviously<00:04:19.229> don't

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
sulfide which the cause obviously don't

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.770 
sulfide which the cause obviously don't
appreciate<00:04:19.889> so<00:04:20.760> with<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> lot<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.359> these<00:04:21.450> types

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
appreciate so with a lot of these types

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.810 
appreciate so with a lot of these types
of<00:04:21.959> corals<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.710> tub<00:04:22.919> or<00:04:23.039> pora<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.700> a

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
of corals like the tub or pora it's a

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.240 
of corals like the tub or pora it's a
really<00:04:24.120> good<00:04:24.240> idea<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.659> on<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.229> regular<00:04:25.710> base

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
really good idea to on a regular base

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.590 
really good idea to on a regular base
just<00:04:26.400> grab<00:04:26.580> ahold<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.180> your<00:04:27.300> hand<00:04:27.480> from

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
just grab ahold of it in your hand from

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.240 
just grab ahold of it in your hand from
underneath<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.530> give<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.920> really<00:04:29.130> good

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
underneath and give it a really good

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.520 
underneath and give it a really good
shake<00:04:29.430> make<00:04:30.420> sure<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.870> get<00:04:31.020> all<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.350> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
shake make sure that you get all of the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.910 
shake make sure that you get all of the
moment<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.910> try<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.240> out<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.410> pores<00:04:34.680> of

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
moment to try this out of the pores of

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.860 
moment to try this out of the pores of
this<00:04:35.070> coral<00:04:35.430> this<00:04:35.910> type<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.180> pore<00:04:36.450> is<00:04:36.540> also

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
this coral this type of pore is also

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.990 
this coral this type of pore is also
right<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.230> top<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.440> an<00:04:37.590> airstone<00:04:37.980> be<00:04:38.520> aware<00:04:38.850> of

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
right on top of an airstone be aware of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.850 
right on top of an airstone be aware of
where<00:04:39.210> your<00:04:39.390> air<00:04:39.540> stones<00:04:39.840> come<00:04:40.140> up<00:04:40.320> because

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
where your air stones come up because

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.950 
where your air stones come up because
one<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.250> corals<00:04:41.580> do<00:04:41.730> get<00:04:41.940> quite<00:04:42.180> irritated

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
one of the corals do get quite irritated

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.980 
one of the corals do get quite irritated
by<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.730> constant<00:04:44.730> massage<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.480> air<00:04:45.660> stone

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
by the constant massage of the air stone

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.620 
by the constant massage of the air stone
now<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.070> far<00:04:47.280> corner<00:04:47.700> over<00:04:47.850> here<00:04:48.000> we've

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
now in the far corner over here we've

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.210 
now in the far corner over here we've
got<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.900> Duncan<00:04:49.290> ops<00:04:49.440> omnious<00:04:49.860> which<00:04:50.070> is

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
got a Duncan ops omnious which is

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.430 
got a Duncan ops omnious which is
obviously<00:04:50.610> fallen<00:04:51.390> off<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.750> top<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.230> reef

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
obviously fallen off the top of the reef

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.400 
obviously fallen off the top of the reef
now<00:04:53.100> this<00:04:53.310> is<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> very<00:04:54.180> regular<00:04:54.810> occurrence

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
now this is a very regular occurrence

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.410 
now this is a very regular occurrence
with<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:55.950> reef<00:04:56.220> aquarium<00:04:56.760> especially<00:04:56.880> if

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
with a reef aquarium especially if

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.900 
with a reef aquarium especially if
you've<00:04:57.540> got<00:04:57.720> large<00:04:58.020> fish<00:04:58.500> now<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.190> large<00:04:59.520> fish

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
you've got large fish now the large fish

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.550 
you've got large fish now the large fish
that<00:05:00.150> are<00:05:00.240> quite<00:05:00.419> strong<00:05:00.750> will<00:05:00.960> often<00:05:01.230> throw

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
that are quite strong will often throw

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.710 
that are quite strong will often throw
around<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.130> actually<00:05:02.460> relocate<00:05:03.120> your<00:05:03.330> corals

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
around and actually relocate your corals

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.570 
around and actually relocate your corals
so<00:05:04.200> you<00:05:04.260> really<00:05:04.620> need<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.919> be<00:05:05.040> checking<00:05:05.430> on<00:05:05.550> a

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
so you really need to be checking on a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.180 
so you really need to be checking on a
weekly<00:05:06.360> or<00:05:06.390> twice<00:05:06.810> weekly<00:05:07.080> basis<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:08.040> make

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
weekly or twice weekly basis to make

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.440 
weekly or twice weekly basis to make
sure<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.490> corals<00:05:08.850> are<00:05:09.030> where<00:05:09.270> they're

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
sure the corals are where they're

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.940 
sure the corals are where they're
supposed<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.930> be<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.470> fish<00:05:10.650> haven't

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
supposed to be and that the fish haven't

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.600 
supposed to be and that the fish haven't
knocked<00:05:11.130> them<00:05:11.310> over<00:05:11.460> because<00:05:12.240> when<00:05:12.450> you
