00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
went ahead and took off the shader she

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.339 
went ahead and took off the shader she
gets<00:00:24.519> to<00:00:24.609> see<00:00:24.759> what<00:00:24.789> it<00:00:25.150> looks<00:00:25.359> like<00:00:25.539> without

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
gets to see what it looks like without

gets to see what it looks like without
the<00:00:26.829> shaders<00:00:27.249> or<00:00:27.489> anything<00:00:27.730> like<00:00:27.909> that<00:00:27.970> won't

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
the shaders or anything like that won't

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.269 
the shaders or anything like that won't
look<00:00:28.390> like<00:00:28.449> shaders<00:00:28.869> at<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.259> so<00:00:29.470> we<00:00:30.069> have<00:00:30.249> the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
look like shaders at that so we have the

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.069 
look like shaders at that so we have the
Fallen<00:00:30.880> guys<00:00:31.029> we<00:00:31.239> have<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.539> helmet<00:00:31.899> which

Fallen guys we have the helmet which
looks<00:00:32.500> pretty<00:00:32.590> similar<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.129> that<00:00:33.250> mask<00:00:33.519> of<00:00:33.699> the

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
looks pretty similar to that mask of the

looks let's go ahead and change these up

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.130 
looks let's go ahead and change these up
with<00:01:36.940> some<00:01:37.120> key<00:01:37.300> shaders<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.780> guys<00:01:37.930> could<00:01:38.050> get

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
with some key shaders you guys could get

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.470 
with some key shaders you guys could get
an<00:01:38.260> idea<00:01:38.470> what<00:01:38.650> that's<00:01:39.010> like<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:40.000> this<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.300> what

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
an idea what that's like so this is what

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.070 
an idea what that's like so this is what
shattered<00:01:40.720> white<00:01:41.050> this<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.990> you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
shattered white this is a a what you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.170 
shattered white this is a a what you
would<00:01:44.200> call<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.680> shader<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.940> picked

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
would call it a shader that you picked

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.910 
would call it a shader that you picked
up<00:01:46.300> when<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.690> do<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> vault<00:01:47.230> of<00:01:47.380> glass<00:01:47.410> this

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
up when you do the vault of glass this

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.350 
up when you do the vault of glass this
is<00:01:48.010> what<00:01:48.190> it<00:01:48.280> looks<00:01:48.430> like<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.760> complete

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
is what it looks like with a complete

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.460 
is what it looks like with a complete
shatter<00:01:49.780> wide<00:01:50.050> gear<00:01:51.360> shader<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:52.720> we<00:01:52.810> go<00:01:53.020> it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
shatter wide gear shader here we go it

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.190 
shatter wide gear shader here we go it
looks<00:01:53.770> really<00:01:54.130> really<00:01:54.310> cool<00:01:54.660> then<00:01:55.660> we<00:01:55.900> have

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
looks really really cool then we have

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.610 
looks really really cool then we have
one<00:01:56.650> of<00:01:56.740> my<00:01:56.830> favorites<00:01:57.310> which<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.580> frost<00:01:58.000> fire

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
one of my favorites which is frost fire

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.840 
one of my favorites which is frost fire
that's<00:01:59.620> what<00:01:59.800> he<00:01:59.920> looks<00:02:00.130> like<00:02:00.280> it's<00:02:00.430> all<00:02:00.580> it's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
that's what he looks like it's all it's

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.580 
that's what he looks like it's all it's
kind<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.150> like<00:02:01.270> he<00:02:01.420> it's<00:02:01.780> supposed<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.260> be<00:02:02.410> like

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
kind of like he it's supposed to be like

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.430 
kind of like he it's supposed to be like
purple<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.550> red<00:02:03.880> but<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.510> more<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.870> think

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
purple and red but this is more I think

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.930 
purple and red but this is more I think
it's<00:02:05.560> more<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:05.890> blue<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.160> red<00:02:06.520> that's<00:02:06.760> what

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
it's more like blue and red that's what

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.290 
it's more like blue and red that's what
it<00:02:07.030> looks<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:07.450> me<00:02:08.850> really<00:02:09.850> really<00:02:10.090> cool

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
it looks like to me really really cool

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.320 
it looks like to me really really cool
looking<00:02:10.630> benches<00:02:11.320> perfectly<00:02:12.100> with<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.520> you

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
looking benches perfectly with the you

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.480 
looking benches perfectly with the you
know<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.690> Cape

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
know with the Cape

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.100 
know with the Cape
so<00:02:14.730> or<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.270> hood<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.630> whatever<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.930> want<00:02:16.050> to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
so or the hood or whatever you want to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.510 
so or the hood or whatever you want to
call<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.710> cool<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> fact

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
call it so really cool I like the fact

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.890 
call it so really cool I like the fact
that<00:02:17.610> when<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.970> change<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.660> shader

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
that when you change it to this shader

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
that when you change it to this shader
you<00:02:18.990> guys<00:02:19.290> notice<00:02:19.620> its<00:02:19.800> face<00:02:19.980> also<00:02:20.310> changes<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you guys notice its face also changes to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.180 
you guys notice its face also changes to
red<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.240> blue<00:02:21.390> giving<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.440> really<00:02:22.860> really

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
red and blue giving it a really really

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.630 
red and blue giving it a really really
really<00:02:23.460> cool<00:02:23.670> look<00:02:24.320> after<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
really cool look after that we have the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
really cool look after that we have the
cryptographic<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.010> gonna<00:02:29.190> give<00:02:29.340> us<00:02:29.370> a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
cryptographic this is gonna give us a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.520 
cryptographic this is gonna give us a
brown<00:02:29.850> looks<00:02:30.090> similar<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.140> regular

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
brown looks similar to what the regular

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.080 
brown looks similar to what the regular
shader<00:02:31.770> looks<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> looks<00:02:32.670> actually<00:02:32.820> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
shader looks like it looks actually a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.540 
shader looks like it looks actually a
lot<00:02:33.300> lot<00:02:33.480> lot<00:02:33.930> similar<00:02:34.380> there's<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.220> global

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
lot lot lot similar there's a global

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.690 
lot lot lot similar there's a global
shader<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.210> from<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.070> from<00:02:38.070> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
shader the one you get from the from the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.900 
shader the one you get from the from the
rate<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.140> not<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> new<00:02:40.770> rate<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.400> old

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
rate the not the new rate but the old

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.130 
rate the not the new rate but the old
previous<00:02:42.690> rate<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.670> dark<00:02:44.910> below<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.570> that's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
previous rate the dark below and that's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740 
previous rate the dark below and that's
what<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.500> looks<00:02:46.710> like<00:02:46.860> right<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:47.750> all

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
what this looks like right here all

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.570 
what this looks like right here all
right<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:48.900> these<00:02:49.290> I'm<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> guys<00:02:50.130> notice<00:02:50.460> it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
right so these I'm you guys notice it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.700 
right so these I'm you guys notice it
doesn't<00:02:50.730> glow<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.480> much<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.200> usually

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
doesn't glow that much as it usually

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.620 
doesn't glow that much as it usually
would<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.520> kind<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.820> gives<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.120> like

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
would it kind of gives you that like

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.310 
would it kind of gives you that like
neon<00:02:55.200> light<00:02:55.470> level<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.400> teal<00:02:57.210> color<00:02:57.320> then

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
neon light level of a teal color then

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.860 
neon light level of a teal color then
after<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.740> we<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.390> gesture<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.750> is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
after that we have the gesture this is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.630 
after that we have the gesture this is
gonna<00:03:00.990> be<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.650> kind<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.980> reference<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
gonna be just to kind of reference a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.620 
gonna be just to kind of reference a
little<00:03:03.270> bit<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:03.780> some<00:03:04.110> future<00:03:04.530> will<00:03:04.740> call

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
little bit of what some future will call

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.150 
little bit of what some future will call
shaders<00:03:06.630> would<00:03:06.810> look<00:03:06.990> like<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.440> your<00:03:07.860> on<00:03:08.100> your

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
shaders would look like on your on your

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.770 
shaders would look like on your on your
hundred<00:03:08.580> looks<00:03:08.970> really<00:03:09.210> cool<00:03:09.360> actually<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
hundred looks really cool actually I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.200 
hundred looks really cool actually I
kind<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.020> like<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.350> whole<00:03:10.800> combo<00:03:11.220> look<00:03:11.400> then

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
kind of like the whole combo look then

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.300 
kind of like the whole combo look then
after<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.570> we<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.900> pre-dawn<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:14.160> is

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
after that we have the pre-dawn this is

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.830 
after that we have the pre-dawn this is
another<00:03:14.610> shader<00:03:14.940> from<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.390> dark<00:03:15.600> below

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
another shader from the dark below

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.410 
another shader from the dark below
you're<00:03:16.020> able<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.350> pick<00:03:16.530> up<00:03:17.120> looks<00:03:18.120> really

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you're able to pick up looks really

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.760 
you're able to pick up looks really
really<00:03:18.630> interesting<00:03:19.020> got<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.320> burgundy

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
really interesting got that burgundy

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.150 
really interesting got that burgundy
color<00:03:20.010> with<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.420> bit<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.950> kind<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
color with a little bit of a kind of a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.430
