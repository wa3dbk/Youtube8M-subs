00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 Try as hard as I can. 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.880
 have tried to live on 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 disrespecting my request for 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.480
 no longer receive these messages from 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.420
 bud cache and once again to live treats 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.500
 customer as his or her client was a 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:29.820
 clown an asshole not respecting 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.890
 only the client plus the laws that govern 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.380
 this kind of attitude 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.360
 I think she is above the good and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.750
 of evil 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.739
 I asked several times over the phone 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.260

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.500
 hot appliance and if you doubt my 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 appliance will make a new appliance 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.700
 tragic relation to live that says 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.460
 respect to the shrewdness with which I live 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.820
 treats your customers and if you also 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.979

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.600

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.689
 messages and they do not immediately 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.549
