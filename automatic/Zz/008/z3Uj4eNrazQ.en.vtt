00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
people put on these videos they

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
people put on these videos they
originally<00:01:58.259> play<00:01:58.439> call<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.680> duty<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
originally play call of duty but you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.539 
originally play call of duty but you
know<00:01:59.490> they've<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.939> grown<00:02:00.590> very<00:02:01.590> bored<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the game and I feel like this is the the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.010 
the game and I feel like this is the the
peak<00:02:05.640> time<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.060> people<00:02:06.210> who<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.659> blow<00:02:06.780> on

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
peak time for people who want to blow on

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.290 
peak time for people who want to blow on
YouTube<00:02:07.409> people<00:02:07.710> who<00:02:07.860> want<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.129> actually<00:02:08.300> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
YouTube people who want to actually I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
YouTube people who want to actually I
don't<00:02:09.720> try<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> make<00:02:10.259> something<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
don't try to make something out of this

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.369 
don't try to make something out of this
YouTube<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.480> seen<00:02:12.750> or<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
know

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.619 
know
just<00:02:13.709> whatever<00:02:13.860> your<00:02:14.129> goal<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.849> think<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
just whatever your goal is I think this

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.089 
just whatever your goal is I think this
is<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> best<00:02:15.989> time<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.709> put<00:02:17.010> out

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
is the best time to really put out

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.710 
is the best time to really put out
content<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.730> make<00:02:17.909> it<00:02:18.060> make<00:02:18.360> sure<00:02:18.390> it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
content and make it make sure it's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.119 
content and make it make sure it's
really<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.170> content<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.769> anything<00:02:19.980> that's

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
really good content not anything that's

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.830 
really good content not anything that's
trash<00:02:20.549> or<00:02:20.730> whatever<00:02:20.940> but<00:02:21.120> make<00:02:21.569> sure<00:02:21.599> it's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
trash or whatever but make sure it's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.009 
trash or whatever but make sure it's
really<00:02:21.930> good<00:02:22.200> quality<00:02:22.739> content<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> uh<00:02:24.019> yeah

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
really good quality content and uh yeah

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.589 
really good quality content and uh yeah
just<00:02:25.260> make<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.409> make<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.860> very<00:02:26.330> interesting<00:02:27.330> to

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
just make it make it very interesting to

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.210 
just make it make it very interesting to
watch<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.110> don't<00:02:28.290> make<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.409> boring<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.010> I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
watch you know don't make a boring so I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.880 
watch you know don't make a boring so I
think<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> best<00:02:31.049> time<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.680> that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
think this is the best time to do that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.949 
think this is the best time to do that
because<00:02:32.370> within<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.209> next<00:02:33.450> month<00:02:33.569> or<00:02:33.900> two

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
because within the next month or two

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.710 
because within the next month or two
people<00:02:34.440> are<00:02:34.500> going<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.709> start<00:02:34.769> doing<00:02:35.720> they're

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
people are going to start doing they're

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.670 
people are going to start doing they're
probably<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.140> start<00:02:37.290> bringing<00:02:37.590> this

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
probably going to start bringing this

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.860 
probably going to start bringing this
game<00:02:37.890> back<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.489> probably<00:02:39.329> try<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.659> make<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
game back and probably try to make a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.009 
game back and probably try to make a
little<00:02:40.049> transition<00:02:40.530> from<00:02:41.150> mw3<00:02:42.150> gameplay'<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
little transition from mw3 gameplay' to

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.420 
little transition from mw3 gameplay' to
black<00:02:43.379> ops<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.769> know<00:02:43.829> they're<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.310> going

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
black ops you know they're really going

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.860 
black ops you know they're really going
to<00:02:44.519> start<00:02:44.610> talking<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:44.970> black<00:02:45.269> ops<00:02:45.480> within

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
to start talking about black ops within

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.530 
to start talking about black ops within
the<00:02:45.959> next<00:02:46.140> couple<00:02:46.290> months<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:48.000> during

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the next couple months so I think during

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.880 
the next couple months so I think during
the<00:02:48.629> summer<00:02:48.930> period<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> summer

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the summer period and it's the summer

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.330 
the summer period and it's the summer
too<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.579> it's<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.379> summer<00:02:52.769> then<00:02:53.160> you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
too so if it's the summer then you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
too so if it's the summer then you
probably<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.180> off<00:02:54.329> from<00:02:54.690> school<00:02:54.870> or

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
probably have it off from school or

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.009 
probably have it off from school or
whatever<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.890> may<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:57.450> best<00:02:57.660> time<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
whatever it may be so the best time to

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.509 
whatever it may be so the best time to
do<00:02:58.109> what<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.349> now<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.799> extra<00:02:59.129> time<00:02:59.340> on

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
do what is now you have extra time on

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.819 
do what is now you have extra time on
your<00:02:59.609> hands<00:02:59.819> make<00:03:00.450> videos<00:03:00.870> make<00:03:01.140> good<00:03:01.379> quality

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
your hands make videos make good quality

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.910 
your hands make videos make good quality
videos<00:03:02.609> make<00:03:02.909> sure<00:03:03.060> they're<00:03:03.650> viewable<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
videos make sure they're viewable you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.559 
videos make sure they're viewable you
know<00:03:05.069> if<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.909> don't<00:03:06.060> want<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.239> watch<00:03:06.299> your<00:03:06.450> own

video then why would you want somebody
else<00:03:08.280> watching<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:08.909> yeah<00:03:09.030> make<00:03:09.209> sure<00:03:09.239> it's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
else watching it so yeah make sure it's

really<00:03:09.959> good<00:03:10.079> quality<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:11.599> yeah<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
really good quality and yeah this is the

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.839 
really good quality and yeah this is the
best<00:03:13.290> time<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.310> you're<00:03:14.640> probably

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
best time to do it so you're probably
