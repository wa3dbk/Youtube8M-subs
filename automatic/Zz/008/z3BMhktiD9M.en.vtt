 back on an iphone 6 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.309
 it's a repair that is not very 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.740
 complicated it takes about one 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.289

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.320
 this operation you will need well 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.230

 every order we will resume 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.190
 the location of the screws and elements 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.260
 we will drop to follow this tutorial 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.879
 paper pattern is offered and you 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.039
 will also find on our website 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.469
 a magnetic pattern or just 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.899
 so that vices can remain on the 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.910
 boss us finally remember that you 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.859

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.600
 website with youtube code 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.100
 we will start right away 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.680
 repair the first thing to do 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.630
 obviously it is to turn off your iphone 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.180
 and then we will proceed to the first 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.770
 step opening the iphone since 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.780
 iphone 5 it's always the same thing 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.570
 you just have to remove the currencies 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.409
 pentalobe noted a1 and a2 on the boss 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.439
 of two montages with the screwdriver 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.369
 adequate one tut there are two methods for 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.960
 open the iphone 6 or you use a 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.700
 double cupping clamp called east 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.829
 slap it's rather reserved for the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.350
 professionals given the cost it 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.250
 just apply the clip and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.229
 then press to open the iphone 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.320
 or else if you use the suction cup 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.840
 which includes in your tool kit you 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.079
 place the suction cup just above the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.360
 home button and then you will shoot 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.619
 slightly wants on the sucker 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.180
 until one day appear which 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.070
 about one or two millimeters and 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.070
 then with the lever you do everything 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.609
 the outline of the screen for eclipsed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.480
 the chassis screen so we do the side 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.230
 left the right side the bottom and top 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.450
 It's not worth it 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 the iphone it will open like a book 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.660
 and most importantly you do not raise the screen to 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.250
 more than 90 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.500
 gray this one being always connected on 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.440
 the motherboard the tablecloths of the screen 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.600
 being behind the plate is a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 metal plate that we named diez 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.010
 1 so we'll zoom in on 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.290
 this plate removes the five vice 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.050
 noted from b1 to b5 with a screwdriver 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.980
 cruciform be careful not to mix 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.050
 abuse is not the same size 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.580
 this is for b1 to b5 and then with 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.240
 a tweezer we will remove the plate is 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.380
 rated diez 1 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.730
 now we have more than 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.550
 disconnect the tablecloths from the screen we have 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.920
 four tablecloth on the screen the tablecloth 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.700
 home button from the camera before the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.860
 touch and finally the tablecloth of the lcd used 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.330
 especially a plastic tool for 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.840
 disconnect made tablecloth no tool 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.920
 metal 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.520
 because there is the motherboard next door 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.520
 finally the last 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.730
 that's it, we're not going to be interested in 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.939
 part screen we will be interested in the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.010
 part of the chassis to remove the camera 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.090
 back 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.349
 this one is at the top right 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 then on the battery but you 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.349
 do not worry you there is always the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.560
 battery we just remove cities j1 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:45.680

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.290
 black sticker that make witnesses 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.040
 opening and then we will remove the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.620
 plate is noted eleven sharp that 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.629
 keeps the rear camera in fact one 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.530
 just disconnect the camera to 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.829
 using the lever and the part of the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:10.540
 montages is now over you 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:13.780
 of course replace your new camera 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.930
 on its original location 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.489
 we applied the clip is the camera the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.750

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.500
 so note that if it's the protection 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.030
 back then the window of the camera that 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.919
 dress but it's not at all 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.110

 again on the tutorial there is 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.270
 not the battery then there was added 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.770
 it's just a matter of editing on 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.690
 will recover the tablecloths from the screen 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.099
 watch the tablecloths on the screen 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.409
 they are very fragile so you have to 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.789
 really handle them with care 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.500
 and be sure of it being 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.500

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.150
 tend to those of the clips this is 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.010
 of itself or badly this clip is so 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.000
 check this point there is a small 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.460
 point on which we will return 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.479

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.509
