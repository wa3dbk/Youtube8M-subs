00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:10.690
 So do not fall is the time you two months compositions 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.920
 When I finally got out of bed and got sick , 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.769
 I will compose 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.769
 I am envy of 15 minutes of continuous change of photos. 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:25.810
 Itguyo everyone is in five movements 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.349
 Out of them the third lead is attached to the title of a song of thanks 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.180
 Of course, we talked briefly to my impression, but this original title is incredibly 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.370
 It's long 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:39.970
 Thanksgiving to the gods at Thanksgiving for the sick 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.900
 It's not only yesterday's more Lydia enormously by hand what the law 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.800
 I will 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.800
 It's the second movement. 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.940
 Only music 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.960
 As if singing a hymn 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.960
 It comes out simple. 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.110
 I used to listen to this music while I was working on my computer. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.690
 Then I saw the keyboard. 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.440
 What is this? 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.470
 But the Thanksgiving people start dancing. 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.670
 Once Larger 5 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.240
 3 So also once again lead 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.240
 Well once 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:27.619
 I was so happy to dance 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.619
 If you come back to the slow part before you go, 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.570
 But this time it's going to be a lot of music. 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.570
 It's a bit different. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.210
 It 's like light leaking through the clouds in the sky 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.210
 We built one by one 5 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 And when that dancing part comes out 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.730
 Once again , once a jacket 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.130
 Once you have done so many works 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:09.860
 I'm not deteriorated to the hearts of the people who built the last Then I 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.860
 The first one comes out again last time. 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.849
 Now the melody is all made out. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.430
 Oh, and now I do not know one. 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.430
 hier 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.010
 This is four hundred memories with 100 pairs of cotton 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.599
 This is delivered 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.050
 This music of which we were sipping on football ttaemu it contained here 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.050
 Come in. 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.980
 Pain during Beethoven did not believe in God For those who rose up two months 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.980
 I have made such acid songs as thankful songs to God . 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.320
 And the music behind it is so sad. 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.350
 This music was originally intended to be used as the last chorus of Beethoven's choral symphony 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.380
 5 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.380
 U 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:15.570
 It was such a string quartet 35 that there was more to the music that was awesome. 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.780
 Let me show you the last string quartets and go to question 16 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.730
 It's a string quartet. It 's Beethoven's last piece. 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.890
 I played the music to try and play . 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.610
 I looked at the score and found something strange on the score . 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.390
 Good night. 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.140
 Let's change the lyrics. 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:43.099
 We are not inde yeonhui Did those who do not get to the song 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:48.120
 Shall I go even looked a little strange, what name would I scoop him of the lyrics 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:53.340
 So reported to the German Wondering should ring 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:57.430
 These horses because this is Beethoven's final score came after even 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.200
 People thought a lot about what this means. 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.600
 But it was not. Some people say, 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.170
 My music should be meat 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.130
 Because let's pay to find what wonak of anguish What did the talk 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.240
 I have. 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.060
 By the way , the film about Beethoven, the immortal lover I saw when I was a kid 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.220
 I could not close my mouth when I saw him again. 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:25.000
 I was surprised because this story is not on the last scene of the movie. 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.730
 Oh, you'll be impressed by the only people who know this talk 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.660
 That's where it comes from. 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.660
 I'll show you the scene. 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.730
 Beethoven is dead by now and is lying in bed 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.610
 What I do not even too sick to come home as well as voice can not be heard 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.490
 When this happens, a woman will be looking for her. 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.490
 He looks for his child . 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.410
 Stop it now. I 've just brought the paperwork from the court. 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.410
 this time 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.819
 They say it is an autograph on the document . 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:12.050
 It was written in there. Beethoven. You can not call Carl Beethoven a real mother. 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:15.909
 I have an order from the court that says I have to hand it over. 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.909
 I will now sign my paperwork. 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.119
 It 's time for destruction and consuls. 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.900
 And then Beethoven wants to say something more to capital 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.840
 But now I'm so sick that I can not hear my voice. 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.900
 Looking for a place to take notes next to 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.900
 Notes are less because there is the music that was written right now 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.860
 This is the writing that gets wet on the sheet music . 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.050
 Only then I'll just say that almanac 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:02.599
 Then she took this sheet of music 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.490
 For Beethoven's noisy ears , he wrote everything underneath it . 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:09.689
 That way you'll be sure to note that 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.590
 It must be so. 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:16.220
 Of course, it's cool in the movies . 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.720
 4 Seven tea trees do not even venture, but you are more beautiful than this 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.720
 Would you 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:25.700
 The felt boat died shortly after . 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.380
 And all the music cards are the target of the envy, 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.120
 It's like a composer like that 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.120
 Thank you guys for not life of Beethoven 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.229
 So when I listen to Beethoven's life with music, 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.129
 I think I understand more 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:48.360
 Tomorrow, we hear some composers influenced by Beethoven. 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:51.810
 That's right, a composer named Schumann. 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.900
 Beethoven's later stringers will study and work first. 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:59.849
 So I keep coming back to Knight 1 music. 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:03.419
 4 The life of Schumann who celebrates its 200th anniversary this year 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:07.909
 Proof of Power Classic I'll see you tomorrow at this time 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.909
 The physiological strength over time, we have to finish here samat 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.730
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.340
 you 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.900
 operate
