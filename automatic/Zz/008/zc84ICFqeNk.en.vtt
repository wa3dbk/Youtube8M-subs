00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
out of a vinyl so they had a bit of a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
out of a vinyl so they had a bit of a
reflective<00:01:45.360> sound<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> pieces<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
reflective sound to it but the pieces of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.630 
reflective sound to it but the pieces of
foam<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.729> corner<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:50.490> helps

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
foam in the corner there and it helps

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.819 
foam in the corner there and it helps
again<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> dampen<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> space<00:01:52.290> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
again just to dampen the space this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.520 
again just to dampen the space this
