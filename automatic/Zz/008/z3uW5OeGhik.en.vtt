good these headphones in terms of audio
quality<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> tried<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.660> they're

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
quality but I tried them out and they're

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
quality but I tried them out and they're
actually<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:46.920> nice<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.520> basis<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
actually really really nice the basis is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.319 
actually really really nice the basis is
really<00:00:48.570> strong<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> trouble<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> little

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
really strong the trouble is is a little

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
really strong the trouble is is a little
bit<00:00:51.510> weak<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> base<00:00:52.620> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
bit weak on them but the base really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
bit weak on them but the base really
makes<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> liked<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.510> some

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
