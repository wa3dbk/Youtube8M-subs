00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it turned out really well so yeah then I

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.959 
it turned out really well so yeah then I
have<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.630> drink<00:00:34.260> me<00:00:34.469> bottle<00:00:34.680> um<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
have this drink me bottle um it's really

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
have this drink me bottle um it's really
really<00:00:36.660> pretty<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.020> made<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> into<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.800> necklace

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
really pretty I made it into a necklace

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.930 
really pretty I made it into a necklace
but<00:00:38.540> what<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> realized<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.460> glue

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
but what I realized is that the glue

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.069 
but what I realized is that the glue
should<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.649> like<00:00:43.649> clear<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.539> solid

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
should be like clear not like a solid

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.900 
should be like clear not like a solid
color<00:00:46.350> almost<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.579> need<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.090> redo<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> one

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
color almost so I need to redo that one

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.090 
color almost so I need to redo that one
