00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520 
been one single win in the last five
minutes<00:01:18.210> between<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.630> two<00:01:18.750> sides<00:01:18.930> oddly

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
minutes between these two sides oddly

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.780 
minutes between these two sides oddly
enough<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.860> event<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> again<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.729> they

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
enough that was event is again and they

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
enough that was event is again and they
weren't<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.210> nil<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.860> that's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
weren't to nil I don't think that that's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.969 
weren't to nil I don't think that that's
really<00:01:23.640> worth<00:01:24.200> investing<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.799> both

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
really worth investing in I think both

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
really worth investing in I think both
sides<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> school<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.479> i<00:01:27.540> think

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sides are going to school but i think

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
sides are going to school but i think
that<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> margin<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> victory<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that the margin of victory is going to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
that the margin of victory is going to
be<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> same<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.850> Ventus<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.150> going

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
be the same I think you Ventus is going

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390 
be the same I think you Ventus is going
to<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.390> three<00:01:30.659> nil<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> vendors

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to be three nil and I think you vendors

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.580 
to be three nil and I think you vendors
can<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.579> 31<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.960> game<00:01:34.200> now

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
can be 31 when is in this game now

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.929 
can be 31 when is in this game now
betting<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> correct<00:01:35.280> score<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> does

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
betting on the correct score it does

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.399 
betting on the correct score it does
give<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> great<00:01:36.509> return<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.079> money

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
give you a great return for your money

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.700 
give you a great return for your money
but<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:37.979> often<00:01:38.310> sort<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> safer<00:01:39.420> bet

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
but it's not often sort of a safer bet

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.800 
but it's not often sort of a safer bet
which<00:01:40.710> bets<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.119> mind<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
which bets do you have in mind that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
which bets do you have in mind that
there<00:01:43.049> does<00:01:43.229> return<00:01:43.560> sort<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> know

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
there does return sort of like you know

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
there does return sort of like you know
good<00:01:44.610> value<00:01:44.729> bet<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> safer<00:01:45.810> option

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
good value bet but it's a safer option

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
good value bet but it's a safer option
and<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.490> safer<00:01:47.790> bet<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and I think it's safer bet is just like

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
and I think it's safer bet is just like
a<00:01:48.509> juventus<00:01:49.079> win<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.680> that's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.040> very

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
a juventus win but that's not very

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.560 
a juventus win but that's not very
interesting<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
interesting and if you want to make that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
interesting and if you want to make that
sort<00:01:51.780> return<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.649> probably<00:01:52.979> shouldn't<00:01:53.369> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
sort return you probably shouldn't be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.740 
sort return you probably shouldn't be
going<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> bookies<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.360> should<00:01:54.659> just

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
going down the bookies you should just

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
going down the bookies you should just
going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> bank<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:56.460> these<00:01:56.549> two

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
going to the bank I think these two

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
going to the bank I think these two
sides<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.659> running<00:01:58.200> into<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> closed

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
sides will be running into the closed

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.289 
sides will be running into the closed
for<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> first<00:01:58.920> half<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.000> vents<00:02:00.240> are

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
for the first half but your vents are

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.209 
for the first half but your vents are
going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> come<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.780> top<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.560> look<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
going to come out on top and look in the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.399 
going to come out on top and look in the
half<00:02:02.399> time<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.729> full<00:02:02.880> time<00:02:03.060> results<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> if

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
half time the full time results and if

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.289 
half time the full time results and if
you<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> game<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:04.950> drawn<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.790> halftime

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you get the game going drawn at halftime

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880 
you get the game going drawn at halftime
and<00:02:06.540> an<00:02:06.840> event<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.259> winning<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.619> full<00:02:07.860> time

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and an event is winning and full time

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
and an event is winning and full time
that<00:02:08.489> goes<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.819> high<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.000> 5.5<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.959> william

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that goes as high as 5.5 with william

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.869 
that goes as high as 5.5 with william
hill<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.709> i<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.099> definitely<00:02:11.459> worth

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
hill and i think that's definitely worth

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.910 
hill and i think that's definitely worth
a<00:02:12.209> few<00:02:12.420> quid<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.260> cast<00:02:13.590> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a few quid it's not cast on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.949 
a few quid it's not cast on
some<00:02:14.069> certainty<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:15.510> definitely<00:02:15.750> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
some certainty but it's definitely a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.420 
some certainty but it's definitely a
good<00:02:16.140> return<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.440> money<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.830> think<00:02:17.310> it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
good return for money I think it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.979 
good return for money I think it's
pretty<00:02:17.610> likely<00:02:17.880> that's<00:02:18.270> where<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.599> cash<00:02:18.840> is

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
pretty likely that's where my cash is

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.780 
pretty likely that's where my cash is
going<00:02:19.230> yeah<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:19.770> think<00:02:19.950> I'm<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.310> crash<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.610> going
