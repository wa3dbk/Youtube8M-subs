said i got grip one because that's the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.190 
said i got grip one because that's the
only<00:01:10.000> attachment<00:01:10.600> you<00:01:10.720> can<00:01:10.750> have<00:01:10.990> but<00:01:11.170> just

kind of like a shotgun secondary cuz
then<00:01:40.510> you'll<00:01:40.660> switch<00:01:40.810> really<00:01:41.500> fast<00:01:41.740> i<00:01:41.980> mean

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
then you'll switch really fast i mean

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.100 
then you'll switch really fast i mean
really<00:01:42.550> fast<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.180> shotgun<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:43.900> kind<00:01:44.080> of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
really fast to a shotgun so it's kind of

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
least a stakeout is that like the stake

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.510 
least a stakeout is that like the stake
out<00:02:10.179> every<00:02:10.750> now<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.080> again<00:02:11.190> now<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.340> again

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520

out every now and again now and again
now<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.090> then<00:02:13.300> um<00:02:14.010> you'll<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> hitmarker

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
now and then um you'll get a hitmarker

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660 
now and then um you'll get a hitmarker
it<00:02:16.660> seems<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.260> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it seems like if you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
it seems like if you
a min<00:02:18.000> you'll<00:02:18.450> always<00:02:18.660> get<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> hitmarker<00:02:19.310> but

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
a min you'll always get a hitmarker but

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.220 
a min you'll always get a hitmarker but
if<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.610> quickscope<00:02:21.150> you'll<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> hit

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
if you like quickscope you'll get a hit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.070 
if you like quickscope you'll get a hit
you<00:02:22.620> won't<00:02:22.800> get<00:02:22.890> hit<00:02:23.099> micros<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.080> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you won't get hit micros much and you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.170 
you won't get hit micros much and you
know<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.260> usually<00:02:25.650> get<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.190> shot<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:27.150> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
know you usually get a one shot but I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.030 
know you usually get a one shot but I
think<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.440> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.739> don't

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
think right here as you can see I don't

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.850 
think right here as you can see I don't
a<00:02:29.400> man<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.120> yeah<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.390> get<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.050> ya<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.650> gotta

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
a man and yeah I get it to ya I gotta

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.640 
a man and yeah I get it to ya I gotta
hit<00:02:32.040> my<00:02:32.190> car<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:34.080> kind<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.350> annoying

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
hit my car so that's kind of annoying

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
hit my car so that's kind of annoying
that<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.610> doesn't<00:02:35.850> really<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.150> hip<00:02:36.420> fire

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that it doesn't really have hip fire

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.740 
that it doesn't really have hip fire
accuracy<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:38.489> long<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> min<00:02:39.330> right

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
accuracy but as long as you a min right

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.210 
accuracy but as long as you a min right
before<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.080> shoot<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.410> should<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.680> fine<00:02:40.950> and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
before you shoot you should be fine and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.309 
before you shoot you should be fine and

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
line noise yeah I said that um but I

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.870 
line noise yeah I said that um but I
don't<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.100> know<00:03:08.280> how<00:03:08.430> explain<00:03:08.730> the
