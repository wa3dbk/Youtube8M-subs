ones I didn't like and then a hundred
thousand<00:01:46.470> JPEG<00:01:47.430> pictures<00:01:48.180> hmm<00:01:48.990> does<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> man

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
thousand JPEG pictures hmm does that man

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.870 
thousand JPEG pictures hmm does that man
either<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.579> let's<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.060> open

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.300 

now<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.630> should<00:01:57.900> be<00:01:58.049> extremely<00:01:58.650> portable<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
now this should be extremely portable I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.969 
now this should be extremely portable I
hope<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.759> there's<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> USB<00:02:00.540> cable<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
hope so there's the USB cable and it
