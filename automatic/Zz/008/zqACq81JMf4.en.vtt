00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.860
 ah ah 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.170
 and if we prepared the same for banana 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.820
 along with milk jam is 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.300
 crispy loosens and for six 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.910
 people 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.890
 it is easy to realize count 10 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.650
 minutes of preparation and seven minutes 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.279
 cooking for the ingredients there you 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.380
 must if brick pastry four bananas 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.060
 2 tablespoons brown sugar 40 g 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.040
 half- salted butter + 20 grams for 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.020
 cooking 3 tablespoons jam 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.680
 Milk first stage preparation 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.780
 spring rolls 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.579
 we start by peeling the bananas and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.730
 by cutting them roughly into small 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.730
 cubes 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.690
 we put them in a salad bowl and add 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.660
 the euro sugar is mixed well so 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.429
 to encompass all our fruit pieces 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.320
 that's it our bananas are ready on 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.329
 then attacks the editing of the nems in 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.469
 starting with melting with 40 g of 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.859
 butter in the microwave for each 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.570
 element 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.530
 I was told young butter a leaf 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.530
 Brick with a brush 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.499
 and then we go to the most 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.689
 delicate rolling of spring rolls 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.219
 for that we have some spoons 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.100
 banana on the bottom of the leaf 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.679
 brick on the sides and roll 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.020
 gently squeezing well to form 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.130
 a good job we proceed from the same 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.130
 way for all the same 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.760
 cooking the same is done at the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.920
 last minute for that melt 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.830
 butter remaining in a frying pan 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.330
 sweet and make the spring rolls on all 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.110
 the sides until they are well 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.110
 crisp 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 for 1m even more greedy add some 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.030
 chocolate chips or chips 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.160
 almonds 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 try also with other fruits 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 previously returned to the pan with a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.400
 little butter and sugar like 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.400
 apples from pears and even mango 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.349
 yeah 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.060
 once the nicely brown spring rolls served 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.189
 their companions and milk jam 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.620
 and for chocolate fans 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:51.250
 why not try with nutella 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.659
 or melted chocolate at table I'm hungry 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.430
