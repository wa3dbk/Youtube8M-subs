design here so just the grip base itself

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
design here so just the grip base itself
is<00:00:38.700> 2999<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.260> want<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> whole

is 2999 and if you want to get the whole

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.060 
is 2999 and if you want to get the whole
package<00:00:41.010> together<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:42.300> 3999<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
package together that's 3999 so this is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.830 
package together that's 3999 so this is
a<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> original<00:00:45.000> iPad<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.690> did

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it something to grip onto but also when

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.320 
it something to grip onto but also when
you<00:01:05.159> put<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> down<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> surface<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> table

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you put it down the surface of the table

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
you put it down the surface of the table
it<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.200> less<00:01:07.320> likely<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> skid<00:01:08.189> around<00:01:08.310> on

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it can be less likely to skid around on

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
it can be less likely to skid around on
the<00:01:09.210> inside<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.869> rubber<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.770> doesn't

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the inside this is all rubber it doesn't

the inside this is all rubber it doesn't
lift<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> case<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.510> bit

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
lift it up off the case a little bit

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.850 
lift it up off the case a little bit
here<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.260> give<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.650> shock

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
here so it does give some shock

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
here so it does give some shock
absorption<00:01:14.250> got<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.760> holes<00:01:14.939> cut<00:01:15.180> out<00:01:15.240> here

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
absorption got some holes cut out here

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
absorption got some holes cut out here
to<00:01:15.600> cut<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> way<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.350> majan<00:01:16.740> but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to cut down on the way down majan but

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
to cut down on the way down majan but
may<00:01:17.040> also<00:01:17.070> help<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:18.060> any<00:01:18.210> shock<00:01:18.509> absorption

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
may also help with any shock absorption

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
may also help with any shock absorption
right<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.009> where<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.280> module

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
right here this is where this module

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
right here this is where this module
design<00:01:21.180> comes<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.500> want<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> know

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
design comes in one thing I want to know
is<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> couple<00:01:23.549> notches<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.390> we'll

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
is a couple notches right here and we'll

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.880 
is a couple notches right here and we'll
see<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.840> works<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.259> minute<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
see how this works in a minute this

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.170 
see how this works in a minute this
basically<00:01:26.189> locks<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.850> two<00:01:27.000> different

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
basically locks in two different

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
basically locks in two different
positions<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.560> portrait

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
positions if you want to go a portrait

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
positions if you want to go a portrait
landscape<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.180> upside<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.900> both

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
landscape you know upside down on both

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.690 
landscape you know upside down on both
of<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.189> out<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.579> we

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
of them but point that out here when we

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.609 
of them but point that out here when we
do<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> review<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
do the review so it's actually get the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.670 
do the review so it's actually get the
the<00:01:35.130> case<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.049> function<00:01:37.380> just

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the case on and this will function just

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.219 
the case on and this will function just
fine<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> regular<00:01:39.240> ipad<00:01:39.659> case<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
fine as a as a regular ipad case in

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
fine as a as a regular ipad case in
addition<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.130> obviously<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> mount<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.420> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
addition to obviously a mount for this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.530 
addition to obviously a mount for this
modular<00:01:43.350> design<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.670> snaps<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.090> just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
modular design so it just snaps on just

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
modular design so it just snaps on just
like<00:01:45.689> some<00:01:45.930> basically<00:01:46.649> gives<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> access<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
like some basically gives you access to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
like some basically gives you access to
all<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> ports<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.720> controls<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.409> in

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
all the ports and controls down here in

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
all the ports and controls down here in
the<00:01:49.530> bottom<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.220> 30<00:01:50.490> pin<00:01:50.729> cable<00:01:51.060> cut

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the bottom we have the 30 pin cable cut

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
the bottom we have the 30 pin cable cut
out<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> mic<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> speakers<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
out the mic are the speakers down the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.359 
out the mic are the speakers down the
bottom<00:01:53.399> then<00:01:54.090> over<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.500> sound<00:01:55.890> are

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
bottom then over here is the sound are

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.609 
bottom then over here is the sound are
the<00:01:56.520> silent<00:01:56.880> rotation<00:01:57.719> lock<00:01:57.899> i'm<00:01:58.350> also<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the silent rotation lock i'm also the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.830 
the silent rotation lock i'm also the
volume<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.549> down<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.360> top<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.750> got

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
volume up and down and up top you got

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.240 
volume up and down and up top you got
the<00:02:00.960> power<00:02:01.140> button<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.799> headset

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the power button and then the headset

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
the power button and then the headset
jack<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.670> top<00:02:02.939> microphone<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.110> overall

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
jack with the top microphone so overall

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.230 
jack with the top microphone so overall
a<00:02:04.469> pretty<00:02:04.799> nice<00:02:05.070> looking<00:02:05.460> case<00:02:05.820> has<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> nice

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
a pretty nice looking case has a nice

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
a pretty nice looking case has a nice
rubber<00:02:06.600> liner<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> way<00:02:07.829> around<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.520> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
rubber liner all the way around it so it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.650 
rubber liner all the way around it so it
looks<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.060> pretty<00:02:09.209> good<00:02:09.390> shock

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
looks like it's pretty good shock

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.960 
looks like it's pretty good shock
absorption<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.709> stays<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.370> pretty

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
absorption and it stays in here pretty

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.610 
absorption and it stays in here pretty
pretty<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
pretty well so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.080 
pretty well so
she<00:02:13.739> take<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> look<00:02:14.129> at<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.370> modular<00:02:14.909> design

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
she take a look at this modular design

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.830 
she take a look at this modular design
this<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.470> again<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> grip<00:02:17.340> base<00:02:17.840> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this one here is again the grip base you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.059 
this one here is again the grip base you
can<00:02:18.989> hold<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.010> is

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
can hold on to it like this and this is

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.100 
can hold on to it like this and this is
where<00:02:20.280> goes<00:02:20.459> on<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> table<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.659> in<00:02:21.870> order<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
where goes on the table now in order to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.990 
where goes on the table now in order to
actually<00:02:22.349> get<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.769> on<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:22.950> has<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.489> kind<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
actually get it on here has a kind of a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.729 
actually get it on here has a kind of a
cool<00:02:24.120> little<00:02:24.390> locking<00:02:24.870> mechanism<00:02:25.409> this<00:02:25.560> you

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
cool little locking mechanism this you

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.890 
cool little locking mechanism this you
basically<00:02:25.950> push<00:02:26.250> these<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.239> will<00:02:27.450> lock

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
basically push these in and it will lock

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.020 
basically push these in and it will lock
it<00:02:28.110> into<00:02:28.290> place<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.769> unlock<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.430> also<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it into place and unlock it also a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.940 
it into place and unlock it also a
little<00:02:30.239> piece<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> rubber<00:02:30.769> material<00:02:31.769> with<00:02:31.860> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
little piece of rubber material with a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.949 
little piece of rubber material with a
little<00:02:32.129> bit<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.760> texture<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
little bit of a texture to it so that

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.259 
little bit of a texture to it so that
will<00:02:34.590> grip<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.310> onto<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> back<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.090> case

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
will grip it onto the back of the case

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.759 
will grip it onto the back of the case
but<00:02:36.420> also<00:02:36.599> this<00:02:37.079> is<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.379> will<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.560> touching

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
but also this is what will be touching

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.559 
but also this is what will be touching
up<00:02:37.980> against<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> ipad<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.269> nice<00:02:39.390> it's

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
up against the ipad so that's nice it's

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.210 
up against the ipad so that's nice it's
not<00:02:39.720> plastic<00:02:39.930> necessarily<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:40.829> hopefully

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
not plastic necessarily so hopefully

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
not plastic necessarily so hopefully
they'll<00:02:41.760> cut<00:02:41.970> down<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.360> any<00:02:42.629> scratches<00:02:43.409> or

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
they'll cut down on any scratches or

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.229 
they'll cut down on any scratches or
anything<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.549> install<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:44.879> just

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
anything like that to install it just

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.970 
anything like that to install it just
basically<00:02:45.390> put<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.930> into<00:02:46.109> place<00:02:46.349> hold<00:02:46.829> down

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
basically put it into place hold down

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
basically put it into place hold down
the<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.549> buttons<00:02:47.879> right<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.329> you're<00:02:48.510> good<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the the buttons right and you're good to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.930 
the the buttons right and you're good to
go<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.319> just<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.190> show<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.370> how<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.640> works

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
go now just to show you how this works

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.550 
go now just to show you how this works
you<00:02:51.209> remember<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.629> mentioned<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.109> had<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> couple

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
you remember I mentioned it had a couple

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.890 
you remember I mentioned it had a couple
notches<00:02:53.069> there<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.030> could<00:02:54.239> hook<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:54.750> up

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
notches there so you could hook this up

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.240 
notches there so you could hook this up
however<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.319> want<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.680> want<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.859> go<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.069> way

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
however you want you want to go this way

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.069 
however you want you want to go this way
you<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.060> go<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.359> way<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:57.989> either

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
you can if you go that way but either

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.069 
you can if you go that way but either
way<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.530> rotates<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.129> full<00:02:59.540> 360<00:03:00.540> run<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.930> can

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
way it rotates a full 360 run you can

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.380 
way it rotates a full 360 run you can
hear<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.349> has<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> preset<00:03:02.220> notches<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:03.239> you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
hear it has a preset notches if you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.149 
hear it has a preset notches if you
wanted<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.720> go<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.959> between<00:03:04.079> or<00:03:04.500> between<00:03:04.829> that

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
wanted to go in between or between that

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.250 
wanted to go in between or between that
is<00:03:05.280> fine<00:03:05.640> also<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.390> does<00:03:06.569> have<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> preset

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
is fine also but does have the preset

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.289 
is fine also but does have the preset
notches<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.010> hold<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.909> its<00:03:09.120> natural

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
notches just to hold it in its natural

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.899 
notches just to hold it in its natural
you<00:03:09.750> know<00:03:09.840> portrait<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.379> landscape<00:03:10.650> views<00:03:11.310> so

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
you know portrait and landscape views so

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.119 
you know portrait and landscape views so
when<00:03:12.329> you're<00:03:12.420> holding<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.859> basically<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:13.980> can

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
when you're holding it basically you can

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.770 
when you're holding it basically you can
decide<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.700> grip<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> go<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.239> watch<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.629> like

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
decide a grip you go to watch it like

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.030 
decide a grip you go to watch it like
this<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.140> also<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.470> know<00:03:16.650> when<00:03:16.769> you're<00:03:16.859> just

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
this but also you know when you're just

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.339 
this but also you know when you're just
kind<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.280> holding<00:03:17.940> onto<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.840> know<00:03:19.319> like

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
kind of holding onto it you know like

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.780 
kind of holding onto it you know like
this<00:03:19.560> gives<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.799> little<00:03:19.950> sort<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.280> palm<00:03:20.489> grip

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
this gives a little sort of a palm grip

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670 
this gives a little sort of a palm grip
so<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.389> can<00:03:21.510> hold<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:21.870> your<00:03:21.930> hand<00:03:22.290> okay

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
so you can hold it with your hand okay

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680 
so you can hold it with your hand okay
and<00:03:22.889> then<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> course<00:03:23.400> it'll<00:03:23.760> work<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> stand

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and then of course it'll work as a stand

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.839 
and then of course it'll work as a stand
when<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:25.380> put<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.650> down<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.700> can

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
when you put it down like so and you can

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.370 
when you put it down like so and you can
change<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> viewing<00:03:27.480> angle<00:03:27.870> however<00:03:28.290> you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
change the viewing angle however you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.500 
change the viewing angle however you
want<00:03:28.590> again<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.549> want<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:29.879> up<00:03:30.329> into

that's<00:03:47.370> really<00:03:47.639> what<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.819> noticed<00:03:48.720> about<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
that's really what I noticed about it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.140 
that's really what I noticed about it
you<00:03:49.799> know<00:03:49.859> my<00:03:50.069> initial<00:03:50.250> my<00:03:50.519> first<00:03:50.849> time<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.000> did

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
you know my initial my first time I did

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.270 
you know my initial my first time I did
it<00:03:51.299> same<00:03:51.989> way<00:03:52.169> a<00:03:52.319> locks<00:03:52.709> right<00:03:52.919> into<00:03:53.010> place

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
it same way a locks right into place

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.490 
it same way a locks right into place
just<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.669> so<00:03:53.970> give<00:03:54.449> you<00:03:54.569> an<00:03:54.690> idea<00:03:54.780> here<00:03:55.260> how

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
just like so give you an idea here how

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.949 
just like so give you an idea here how
this<00:03:55.680> looks<00:03:55.889> so<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:56.699> rotates<00:03:57.359> like<00:03:57.449> this<00:03:57.780> you

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
this looks so this rotates like this you

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.289 
this looks so this rotates like this you
can<00:03:58.109> go<00:03:58.319> all<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.370> way<00:03:59.400> forward<00:03:59.730> all<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.090> way

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
can go all the way forward all the way

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.000 
can go all the way forward all the way
back<00:04:00.599> so<00:04:00.959> depending<00:04:01.319> how<00:04:01.440> ever<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.650> want<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
back so depending how ever you want to

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.270 
back so depending how ever you want to
go<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.699> also<00:04:02.940> rotates<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.690> full<00:04:04.019> 360<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.220> you

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
go this also rotates a full 360 so you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.369 
go this also rotates a full 360 so you
can<00:04:05.459> work<00:04:05.609> with<00:04:05.639> it<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.389> and<00:04:06.569> then<00:04:07.139> this

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
can work with it like that and then this

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.640 
can work with it like that and then this
locks<00:04:08.160> again<00:04:08.370> over<00:04:09.269> like<00:04:09.599> this<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.560> is

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
locks again over like this this is

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.680 
locks again over like this this is
really<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.919> great<00:04:10.980> key<00:04:11.400> table<00:04:12.030> stand<00:04:12.269> i'm<00:04:12.449> using
