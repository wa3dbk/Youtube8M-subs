00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.100
 mortals how are you talking to them 807 a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.710
 new minecraft video good guys in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 this time I bring you how to change 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.599
 survival to creative and creative 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.400
 absorb something is very simple first 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.049
 we will create a new worlds so that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.940
 there is no confusion and see that this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.490
 it's very true we're going to call it from 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.900
 creative south 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 so that you understand the creative 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.950
 observer obviously and we're going to put 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 obviously done here and we're going to create the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.270
 world in survival mode 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.210
 here we are entering as you can see the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.670
 world and I will teach you how to enter first 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 I want you to notice that the world is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.059
 in survival as you can see I do not have 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.519
 nothing I have the hearts I have the life 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 quietly and we are going to destroy something 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.970
 if they see that it is not destroyed in a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.879
 quick as they were creative or 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.530
 I can fly and well then, not ready 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.540
 I have nothing now let's leave the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.299
 title and this is the very easy way in 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.570
 version 0.11 as you can see that 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.850
 they only put in the pencil and have the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 option to change creative and nothing else 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 they give him back and ready and they go back inside 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.229
 to the world of creative junk as they can 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.479
 see and you have to load and ready look 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.159
 we are already in creative mode so 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.570
 let's put a little thing we're going to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.939
 put what I had to keep what from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 diamond what diamond thing so if 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.260
 you are one of those people that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.750
 you do not like to go to mine and get your 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.760
 own diamond good here we can 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 art so that you are full diamond and 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.790
 we can fight with rock and roll mode 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.620
 to all the enemies that you want 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 kill and all good let's catch wood 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.580
 also to equip two full 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.430
 diamond you will see we are already in mode 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.570
 creative and we're going to put rock rock rock 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.580
 not so much to make good peak we left 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.740
 of the title and we do the same again 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.300
 procedure we play 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.190
 We put in the little part of the pencil 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.800
 creative observes there is one and another we are going to 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.259
 survival once changed we put 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.970
 back and we go back into the world this 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.700
 is it I do because many people do not 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.320
 they know how to do that I did not know either 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.050
 until I realized it makes a video and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 just like that I bring them so that 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.220
 do it good here we are going to take the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.959
 woods we're going to take the wood so 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.520
 they are not going to need what to leave 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.870
 undermine and waste many hours looking 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.180
 diamonds that we all know is very 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.880
 difficult here we make a nice table 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.740
 I move a few sticks and well let's see 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.210
 what 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.920
 we need more wood I see that 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.350
 we need more wood to achieve 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.750
 of the tropics plus wood to make 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.390
 our peak and good we are going to put what 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.160
 which is our table of character to know 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.580
 if we are going to put our costing table 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.220
 and we are going to fidget not what a nice 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.630
 peak a nice good peak we already have the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.910
 peak now let's apply what is the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.150
 stone once biting the stone and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.060
 we can make our stone peak 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.040
 to be able to chop what iron is already 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.600
 we have now if we can we did not 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.400
 our stone peak and now we're going to 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.770
 be able to chop the necessary iron because 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.560
 we only chop one because here they have 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.080
 nine ingots so we already have iron 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.820
 but because I do not get the peaks of 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.710
 iron I think I do not have because I do not have 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.270
 for I see them I do not get the iron 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.700
 well let's apply a little more 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.530
 wood maybe I'm missing good if I have 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.960
 I do not know what I missed but something 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.480
 missed so let's see six without 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.280
 want something but the list ready here already 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.780
 we have the iron spikes and now 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.340
 let's apply what the blocks are 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.040
 of diamond let's apply a couple of 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.219
 Diamond buds will have 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.590
 diamond armor and let's iron the 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.310
 diamond forgiveness in a very fast way 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.359
 and effective mortals so let's 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.280
 to tinker not what is like a diamond 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.620
 let's put and now let's make ourselves 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.409
 some bibs or some nice boots 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.500
 pants and a sword and let's go to 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:51.500
 Christians a little bit more diamond 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.390
 to make us bull good and good guys 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.889
 it does not matter the thing is that we are already 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.689
 as you can see no character from 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.200
 wolverine if you like my skin dale like 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:02.810

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.260
 we are and ready and now if we can go out 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.980
