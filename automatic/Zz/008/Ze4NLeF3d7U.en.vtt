00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
knife that has a 50/50 edge meaning that

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.789 
knife that has a 50/50 edge meaning that
bevel<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:05.940> each<00:00:06.210> side<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.960> sharpened<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> same

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
bevel on each side is sharpened the same

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.089 
bevel on each side is sharpened the same
same<00:00:08.730> angles<00:00:09.120> same<00:00:09.540> width<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> knife<00:00:10.710> here

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
same angles same width on the knife here

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.060 
same angles same width on the knife here
I<00:00:11.130> have<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> 2-0<00:00:11.660> petit<00:00:12.660> knife<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.860> sharpen

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
I have a 2-0 petit knife and to sharpen

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.349 
I have a 2-0 petit knife and to sharpen
5050<00:00:15.000> very<00:00:15.719> similar<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> 70/30<00:00:16.949> edge<00:00:17.359> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
5050 very similar to a 70/30 edge the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.660 
5050 very similar to a 70/30 edge the
only<00:00:18.510> difference<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> angles<00:00:19.800> will<00:00:20.550> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
only difference is the angles will be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.060 
only difference is the angles will be
the<00:00:20.820> same<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.480> again<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> lift<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> spine

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the same so again I lift up on the spine

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.670 
the same so again I lift up on the spine
a<00:00:23.100> little<00:00:23.279> bit<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.930> same<00:00:24.930> technique<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
just above the edge here it just gives

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.320 
just above the edge here it just gives
me<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.450> lot<00:00:50.630> of<00:00:50.660> control<00:00:51.970> when<00:00:52.970> sharpened<00:00:55.330> so

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
raising the bar on the knife so again

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.049 
raising the bar on the knife so again
you<00:01:03.500> give<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:03.740> sections<00:01:04.250> or<00:01:04.610> once<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:04.910> get

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
you give you sections or once you get

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.360 
you give you sections or once you get
more<00:01:05.180> comfortable<00:01:05.420> sharpening<00:01:06.250> maybe<00:01:07.250> you

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
more comfortable sharpening maybe you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
can give this a try and just sort of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.670 
can give this a try and just sort of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
slide your fingers down the spine I'm

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.630 
slide your fingers down the spine I'm
sorry<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.100> bevel<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.729> knife<00:01:13.880> like<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.640> now

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
sorry the bevel of the knife like so now

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.250 
sorry the bevel of the knife like so now
we're<00:01:16.790> just<00:01:16.910> doing<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.510> little<00:01:17.750> less<00:01:17.930> part

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
we're just doing that a little less part

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.040 
we're just doing that a little less part
here<00:01:18.619> which<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.400> heel<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.700> again<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.840> is

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
here which is the heel so again this is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.969 
here which is the heel so again this is
the<00:01:24.140> front<00:01:24.410> side<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:30.650> we're<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:30.920> to

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
the front side and now we're going to

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.800 
the front side and now we're going to
use<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.729> same<00:01:31.940> angle<00:01:32.300> as<00:01:32.390> we<00:01:32.509> did<00:01:32.630> on<00:01:32.750> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
use the same angle as we did on the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.680 
use the same angle as we did on the
front<00:01:33.020> side<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.820> back<00:01:35.000> side<00:01:35.210> being<00:01:35.540> that

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
front side on the back side being that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.770 
front side on the back side being that
it's<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:35.869> 50/50<00:01:36.440> edge<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:38.210> don't<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.540> to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it's a 50/50 edge so you don't have to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.440 
it's a 50/50 edge so you don't have to
change<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:41.030> angle

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.320 

so<00:01:47.990> if<00:01:48.080> he<00:01:48.229> moves<00:01:48.580> excuse<00:01:49.580> me<00:01:49.700> if<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:49.880> use<00:01:50.060> long

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
so if he moves excuse me if you use long

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.870 
so if he moves excuse me if you use long
strokes<00:01:51.310> like<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.960> your<00:01:53.960> stone<00:01:54.260> will<00:01:54.440> wear

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
strokes like this your stone will wear

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.140 
strokes like this your stone will wear
more<00:01:55.880> evenly

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.350 

yeah<00:02:04.150> we'll<00:02:04.300> just<00:02:04.330> check<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.810> for<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.110> bird

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.950 

so<00:02:09.900> again<00:02:10.320> 50/50<00:02:11.070> knife-sharpening<00:02:11.960> same

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
so again 50/50 knife-sharpening same

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.920 
so again 50/50 knife-sharpening same
angle<00:02:13.320> on<00:02:13.410> both<00:02:13.590> sides<00:02:17.450> turn<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.570> neck<00:02:18.720> over

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
angle on both sides turn the neck over

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.700 
angle on both sides turn the neck over
again<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.130> lifting<00:02:20.460> up<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.710> you'll

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
again just lifting up like so you'll

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.450 
again just lifting up like so you'll
feel<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:22.980> click<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.520> there

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
feel that click in there

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.920 
feel that click in there
and<00:02:26.460> then<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.730> backside<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.510> basic

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
and then the backside that's the basic

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then the backside that's the basic
of<00:02:31.020> sharpening<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.740> 50/50<00:02:32.400> penny
