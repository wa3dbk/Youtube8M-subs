00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:29.150
 I had a dream like that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.150
 Grabbing someone's hand 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.300
 I poured a ringing laugh 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.450
 Why does the heart beat like that in the chest? 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.600
 I had a dream like that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.750
 I open my eyes 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.450
 And I see the familiar moon 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.600
 The dream was beautiful, but the heart did not care 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 My soul aches from melancholy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 I can’t shed tears 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.300
 After all, I do not feel lonely 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.100
 And the smile that remained after sleep 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.500
 I'll freeze forever 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.350
 I can’t shed tears 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.600
 I'm too cold for that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.100
 As if lonely or sad 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.500
 I do not become 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.050
 Tears all the same, I will not shed 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 Very close 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.650
 Someone's laughter rang tantalizingly. 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.500
 I laughed back 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.900
 And he was gone 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.950
 I had a dream like that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.200
 And warm in the chest 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.950
 Some strange feeling 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.750
 Whether joy, sadness 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.300
 Is it loneliness? 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.600
 Someone tell me 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.400
 I can’t shed tears 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.700
 After all, I do not feel lonely 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.550
 That warmth that gave me my dream 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.800
 I'll freeze forever 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 I can’t shed tears 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.050
 I'm too cold for that 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.500
 As if lonely or sad 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.950
 I do not become 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.400
 Tears all the same, I will not shed 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.050
 I can’t shed tears 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.350
 After all, I do not feel lonely 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.150
 That heart that longs for more dreams 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.350
 Turn on the ice forever 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.350
 I can’t shed tears 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.650
 I'm too cold for that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.150
 As if lonely or sad 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.550
 I do not become 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.900
 Tears all the same, I will not shed 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.250
 Please hear someone 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.500
 Do not leave me alone 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.750
 Anyone be with me 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.150
 Somebody warm me 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
 And then, by all means 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.100
 I want to melt from the heat
