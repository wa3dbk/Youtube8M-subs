you know a big piece made that fits over
the<00:00:46.140> top<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.579> looked<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.210> about

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the top of it we looked at just about

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.700 
the top of it we looked at just about
everything<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:48.989> everything<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.500> super

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
everything but everything was super

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
everything but everything was super
expensive<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:51.300> husband<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.660> decided<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
expensive so my husband I decided that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.369 
expensive so my husband I decided that
there<00:00:52.350> had<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> cheaper<00:00:53.670> way<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.719> make

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
there had to be a cheaper way to make

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.979 
there had to be a cheaper way to make
our<00:00:55.559> fireplace<00:00:56.070> look<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> part<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> our

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
our fireplace look like a part of our

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.849 
our fireplace look like a part of our
newly<00:00:58.530> reconstructed<00:00:58.980> house<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:01.500> husband

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
newly reconstructed house so my husband

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.590 
newly reconstructed house so my husband
was<00:01:02.160> actually<00:01:02.309> manager<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.120> Ace<00:01:03.239> Hardware

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
was actually manager for an Ace Hardware

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
was actually manager for an Ace Hardware
and<00:01:03.840> had<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> brilliant<00:01:04.409> idea<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> trying

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and had the brilliant idea of trying

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
and had the brilliant idea of trying
quikrete<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.530> did<00:01:07.680> check<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
quikrete so that's what we did check it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
quikrete so that's what we did check it
out<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.030> here's<00:01:09.210> always<00:01:09.510> started<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
out so here's always started with the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.590 
out so here's always started with the
before<00:01:10.740> fireplace<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.330> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
before fireplace and as you can see it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880 
before fireplace and as you can see it's
just<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.200> dark<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.770> bit

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
just a little bit dark a little bit

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
just a little bit dark a little bit
dated<00:01:14.100> brick<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.119> wanted<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> change<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.930> up

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
dated brick so we wanted to change it up

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
dated brick so we wanted to change it up
and<00:01:16.200> give<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> fresh<00:01:16.740> lighter<00:01:17.070> look<00:01:17.310> my

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and give it a fresh lighter look my

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
and give it a fresh lighter look my
first<00:01:18.119> step<00:01:18.330> was<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> cover<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> four

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
first step was to cover up the four

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
first step was to cover up the four
vents<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.220> around<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> area<00:01:20.970> there

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
vents that you see around the area there

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
vents that you see around the area there
used<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.869> insert<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> blower<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
used to be an insert with a blower in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.910 
used to be an insert with a blower in
this<00:01:24.090> fireplace<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.409> rid<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this fireplace but we got rid of it and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.410 
this fireplace but we got rid of it and
our<00:01:26.009> chimney<00:01:26.369> sweep<00:01:26.610> told<00:01:26.850> us<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.180> long<00:01:27.390> as

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
our chimney sweep told us as long as

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
our chimney sweep told us as long as
we're<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.810> burning<00:01:28.080> wood<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> firebox

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
we're just burning wood in the firebox

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
we're just burning wood in the firebox
that<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.329> okay<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.659> cover<00:01:30.869> those

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that we it would be okay to cover those

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.640 
that we it would be okay to cover those
vents<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.040> used<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> cement<00:01:33.509> board<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
vents up so we used a cement board the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.499 
vents up so we used a cement board the
kind<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> use<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> put<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.150> tile

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
kind that you use when you put down tile

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
kind that you use when you put down tile
we<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.960> cut<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.500> pieces<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.950> cement

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we just cut out some pieces of cement

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
we just cut out some pieces of cement
board<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.759> put<00:01:39.509> those<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> VINs<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.439> cover

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
board and put those in the VINs to cover

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
board and put those in the VINs to cover
them<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.030> also<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.420> clean

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
them up and then you also want to clean

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.550 
them up and then you also want to clean
it<00:01:42.659> off<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.439> doesn't

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it off really well I know it doesn't

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.080 
it off really well I know it doesn't
look<00:01:43.710> clean<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> didn't<00:01:44.670> clean<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.880> off

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
look clean but I didn't clean it off

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
look clean but I didn't clean it off
with<00:01:45.270> soap<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> water<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.710> next<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.220> mix<00:01:47.490> up

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
with soap and water so next we mix up

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.030 
with soap and water so next we mix up
our<00:01:47.850> quikrete<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.350> bought<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:49.799> bags

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
our quikrete and we just bought two bags

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.639 
our quikrete and we just bought two bags
of<00:01:50.340> quikrete<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.360> bottle<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.079> cement

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
of quikrete and a bottle of cement

of quikrete and a bottle of cement
bonding<00:01:53.189> agent<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.090> find<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.689> at

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
bonding agent you can find that all at

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800 
bonding agent you can find that all at
your<00:01:55.439> hardware<00:01:55.649> store<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.969> two<00:01:57.329> bags<00:01:57.540> of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
your hardware store the two bags of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.810 
your hardware store the two bags of
quikrete<00:01:58.020> we're<00:01:58.409> about<00:01:58.590> six<00:01:58.979> bucks<00:01:59.250> each<00:01:59.549> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
quikrete we're about six bucks each and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
quikrete we're about six bucks each and
the<00:01:59.939> bonding<00:02:00.329> agent<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:01.110> five<00:02:01.380> dollars

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the bonding agent was about five dollars

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.889 
the bonding agent was about five dollars
or<00:02:02.040> something<00:02:02.219> around<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.540> bonding

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
or something around there the bonding

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.690 
or something around there the bonding
agent<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.320> kind<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> glue<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
agent is kind of like a glue that is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.639 
agent is kind of like a glue that is
going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.939> help<00:02:06.210> give<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> cement<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.200> better

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
going to help give that cement a better

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.100 
going to help give that cement a better
consistency<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.759> help<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> hold<00:02:09.750> together

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
consistency and help it hold together

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.650 
consistency and help it hold together
better<00:02:10.679> when<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.459> applied

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
better when it's applied

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.420 
better when it's applied
in<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.900> sinner<00:02:13.290> way<00:02:13.590> than<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.100> usually

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
in a sinner way than what you usually

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.690 
in a sinner way than what you usually
would<00:02:14.970> use<00:02:15.150> quikrete<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:17.130> mixed<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.550> up

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
would use quikrete for so I mixed it up

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.430 
would use quikrete for so I mixed it up
I<00:02:17.850> did<00:02:18.000> end<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.240> adding<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.720> little<00:02:18.990> bit<00:02:19.170> more

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
I did end up adding a little bit more

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.930 
I did end up adding a little bit more
water<00:02:19.680> than<00:02:19.980> what<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.220> said<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.820> was<00:02:20.910> a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
water than what it said just so it was a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.610 
water than what it said just so it was a
little<00:02:21.180> easier<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.720> work<00:02:21.750> with<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.590> just

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
little easier to work with and I just

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.560 
little easier to work with and I just
applied<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.310> using<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.880> putty<00:02:24.120> knife<00:02:24.210> what

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
applied it using a putty knife what

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.980 
applied it using a putty knife what
you'd<00:02:24.720> use<00:02:24.960> for<00:02:25.340> sheetrocking<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.750> I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
you'd use for sheetrocking now this I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.260 
you'd use for sheetrocking now this I
won't<00:02:28.200> lie<00:02:28.380> was<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.890> tricky<00:02:29.220> part<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:30.210> of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
won't lie was the tricky part I kind of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.450 
won't lie was the tricky part I kind of
had<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> figure<00:02:30.750> out<00:02:30.930> how<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.220> there

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
had to figure out how to put it on there

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.670 
had to figure out how to put it on there
so<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.730> would<00:02:32.820> hold<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.630> work<00:02:34.200> well<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so it would hold on and work well and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.110 
so it would hold on and work well and
you<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> do<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.490> little<00:02:35.790> bit<00:02:35.910> at<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> time

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you have to do it a little bit at a time

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.630 
you have to do it a little bit at a time
it<00:02:36.540> takes<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.870> long<00:02:37.110> time<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.740> but<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.340> put<00:02:38.550> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
it takes a long time to do but I put it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.550 
it takes a long time to do but I put it
on<00:02:38.760> probably<00:02:38.940> about<00:02:39.120> 1/4<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.930> 1/2<00:02:40.050> inch<00:02:40.470> thick

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
on probably about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.740 
on probably about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick
and<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.550> kind<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.850> filled<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.600> then

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and just kind of filled it in and then

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.810 
and just kind of filled it in and then
the<00:02:42.870> trick<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.440> give<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.710> texture<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.700> want

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
the trick is to give it texture you want

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.420 
the trick is to give it texture you want
to<00:02:44.970> make<00:02:45.120> sure<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.600> give<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.110> whole

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
to make sure that you give the whole

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.070 
to make sure that you give the whole
facade<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.460> nice<00:02:48.000> texture<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:48.870> when<00:02:48.990> it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
facade a nice texture because when it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.890 
facade a nice texture because when it
dries<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:50.190> gonna<00:02:50.400> look<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:50.700> stone<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
dries it's gonna look like stone so I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.450 
dries it's gonna look like stone so I
was<00:02:52.050> careful<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.440> kind<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.740> go<00:02:52.860> back<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.070> try

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
was careful to kind of go back and try

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.220 
was careful to kind of go back and try
to<00:02:53.520> smooth<00:02:54.240> out<00:02:54.390> any<00:02:54.540> areas<00:02:54.780> where<00:02:54.960> you<00:02:55.110> could

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to smooth out any areas where you could

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.230 
to smooth out any areas where you could
see<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.740> edges<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.280> putty<00:02:56.490> knife<00:02:56.760> but

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
see the edges of the putty knife but

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.900 
see the edges of the putty knife but
still<00:02:57.630> keep<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.200> texture<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.730> what

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
still keep that texture and here is what

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.970 
still keep that texture and here is what
it<00:03:00.000> looked<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.300> when<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.630> dried<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.290> was<00:03:01.950> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it looked like when it dried it was a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.580 
it looked like when it dried it was a
nice<00:03:02.340> light<00:03:02.760> gray<00:03:03.180> color<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.930> as<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.530> see

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
nice light gray color and as you can see

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.770 
nice light gray color and as you can see
the<00:03:04.830> from<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> up-close<00:03:05.580> shot<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.120> really

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the from the up-close shot it really

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.080 
the from the up-close shot it really
looks<00:03:06.990> like<00:03:07.080> stone<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.610> texture

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
looks like stone because of that texture

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.880 
looks like stone because of that texture
that<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.390> put<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.750> there<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.860> a

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
that we put in there and this was a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.980 
that we put in there and this was a
really<00:03:11.400> great<00:03:11.700> alternative<00:03:11.850> for<00:03:12.450> us<00:03:12.570> because

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
really great alternative for us because

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.410 
really great alternative for us because
it<00:03:13.200> cost<00:03:13.440> less<00:03:13.710> than<00:03:13.950> $30<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.850> do<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.090> did<00:03:15.240> take

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it cost less than $30 to do it did take

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.150 
it cost less than $30 to do it did take
a<00:03:15.450> whole<00:03:15.690> night<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.440> was<00:03:16.590> worth<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.010> for

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
a whole night but it was worth it for

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.070 
a whole night but it was worth it for
the<00:03:17.250> money<00:03:17.430> we<00:03:17.580> saved<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.360> last<00:03:18.570> step<00:03:18.840> will<00:03:19.050> be

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the money we saved the last step will be

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.350 
the money we saved the last step will be
to<00:03:19.200> add<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> mantle<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.460> then<00:03:20.640> we<00:03:20.850> will<00:03:21.030> be<00:03:21.150> all

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
to add a mantle and then we will be all

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.930 
to add a mantle and then we will be all
done<00:03:21.860> now<00:03:22.860> again<00:03:23.100> we<00:03:23.310> did<00:03:23.520> check<00:03:23.730> with<00:03:23.790> our

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
done now again we did check with our

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.130 
done now again we did check with our
chimney<00:03:24.360> sweep<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.690> make<00:03:24.840> sure<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.020> this

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
chimney sweep to make sure that this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.420 
chimney sweep to make sure that this
would<00:03:25.290> be<00:03:25.410> okay<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.830> use

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
would be okay to use

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.580 
would be okay to use
I've<00:03:26.640> got<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> okay<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.410> far

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
I've got the okay and so far

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.110 
I've got the okay and so far
everything's<00:03:29.010> worked<00:03:29.250> out<00:03:29.400> really<00:03:29.610> well<00:03:29.760> with

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
everything's worked out really well with

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.450 
everything's worked out really well with
it<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:31.020> only<00:03:31.080> problem<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.770> sometimes<00:03:32.310> we

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
it the only problem that sometimes we

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.190 
it the only problem that sometimes we
have<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.120> likes<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.390> get<00:03:33.600> dusty<00:03:34.080> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
have is that it likes to get dusty and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.710 
have is that it likes to get dusty and
crumble<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.800> little<00:03:34.830> bit<00:03:35.190> sometimes<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:36.390> hasn't

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
crumble a little bit sometimes it hasn't

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.850 
crumble a little bit sometimes it hasn't
cracked<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.080> anything<00:03:37.110> like<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.740> my

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
cracked or anything like that and my

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.530 
cracked or anything like that and my
kids<00:03:38.070> crawl<00:03:38.310> all<00:03:38.520> over<00:03:38.550> at<00:03:38.880> all<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> time<00:03:39.240> so<00:03:39.480> I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
kids crawl all over at all the time so I

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.660 
kids crawl all over at all the time so I
know<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:39.840> pretty<00:03:40.050> durable<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:41.340> only<00:03:41.490> thing

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
know it's pretty durable the only thing

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.220 
know it's pretty durable the only thing
that<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.120> might<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> future<00:03:42.990> is

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
that I think I might do in the future is

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.110 
that I think I might do in the future is
try<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.530> find<00:03:43.800> some<00:03:44.160> sort<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.430> fireproof

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
try to find some sort of fireproof

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
try to find some sort of fireproof
sealer<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.080> could<00:03:46.260> maybe<00:03:46.440> put<00:03:46.800> over<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
sealer that I could maybe put over the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.780 
sealer that I could maybe put over the
whole<00:03:47.459> cement<00:03:49.070> area<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.520> would<00:03:50.610> kind

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
whole cement area so that it would kind

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.040 
whole cement area so that it would kind
of<00:03:50.850> seal<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.270> together<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.630> little<00:03:51.810> bit<00:03:51.990> better

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
of seal it together a little bit better

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.080 
of seal it together a little bit better
but<00:03:52.440> other<00:03:52.680> than<00:03:52.800> that<00:03:52.920> we're<00:03:53.550> really<00:03:53.850> happy
