00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.649 
of the really cool parts of this kit is
that<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.140> started<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.880> full-on<00:01:53.880> modular

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that we started with a full-on modular

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
that we started with a full-on modular
system<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.259> top<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> bottom<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.520> you're<00:01:56.700> able

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
system from top to bottom so you're able

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.660 
system from top to bottom so you're able
to<00:01:57.030> regulate<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.469> garments<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
to regulate the the garments that you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
to regulate the the garments that you
want<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.930> them<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> conditions<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
want for them for the conditions that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.350 
want for them for the conditions that
you're<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.619> one<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> cool<00:02:05.460> things<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you're in one of the cool things is is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.940 
you're in one of the cool things is is
that<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.810> you've<00:02:06.960> got<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.320> many<00:02:07.409> layers<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that when you've got so many layers on

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.460 
that when you've got so many layers on
it<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.369> often<00:02:09.030> hard<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> want

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
it it's often hard to get what you want

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.840 
it it's often hard to get what you want
so<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.220> added<00:02:11.400> an<00:02:11.700> extra<00:02:11.879> internal<00:02:12.510> zip

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
so we added an extra internal zip

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.420 
so we added an extra internal zip
or<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.570> you're<00:02:13.780> able<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.140> dig<00:02:14.380> down<00:02:14.650> deep<00:02:15.070> into

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
or so you're able to dig down deep into

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.310 
or so you're able to dig down deep into
the<00:02:15.730> other<00:02:15.910> layering<00:02:16.240> systems<00:02:16.780> which<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.110> nice

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
the other layering systems which is nice

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.870 
the other layering systems which is nice
we<00:02:17.950> also<00:02:18.100> do<00:02:18.370> critically<00:02:19.180> placed<00:02:19.510> pit<00:02:20.260> zips<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
we also do critically placed pit zips to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.550 
we also do critically placed pit zips to
dump<00:02:22.210> some<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.660> heat<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.230> won't

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
dump some of the heat so you won't

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.050 
dump some of the heat so you won't
overheat<00:02:24.040> once<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.400> have<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.700> start<00:02:24.880> hiking

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
overheat once you have to start hiking

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.900 
overheat once you have to start hiking
up<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.360> hill<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.830> billowing<00:02:26.830> pockets<00:02:27.460> on<00:02:27.640> his

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
up the hill and billowing pockets on his

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.550 
up the hill and billowing pockets on his
bib<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:28.480> you're<00:02:28.630> able<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.930> fit<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> little<00:02:29.440> bit

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
bib so you're able to fit a little bit

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560 
bib so you're able to fit a little bit
more<00:02:29.740> stuff<00:02:30.100> in<00:02:30.340> which<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.670> key<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:30.940> us<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
more stuff in which is key for us and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.220 
more stuff in which is key for us and
big<00:02:32.230> side<00:02:32.620> zips<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:34.450> go<00:02:34.600> all<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.080> way<00:02:35.110> down

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
big side zips that go all the way down

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.920 
big side zips that go all the way down
to<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.710> knee<00:02:36.070> which<00:02:36.760> again<00:02:37.120> allows<00:02:37.360> for

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
to the knee which again allows for

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.820 
to the knee which again allows for
dumping<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.410> lot<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.890> heat<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:41.140> far<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.650> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
dumping a lot of the heat as far as the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.170 
dumping a lot of the heat as far as the
cuff<00:02:42.460> sabres<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> back<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:44.290> guards

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
cuff sabres on the back the guards

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.300 
cuff sabres on the back the guards
instead<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.210> doing<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.660> big<00:02:46.840> black<00:02:47.140> patch<00:02:47.500> we

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
instead of doing a big black patch we

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.330 
instead of doing a big black patch we
did<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.670> patch<00:02:48.880> internally<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:51.070> you're<00:02:51.220> able

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
did the patch internally so you're able

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.240 
did the patch internally so you're able
to<00:02:51.550> still<00:02:51.760> have<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.330> nice<00:02:52.510> clean<00:02:52.930> look

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
to still have a really nice clean look

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.140 
to still have a really nice clean look

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
going back to his material so we're

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.990 
going back to his material so we're
super<00:02:58.480> excited<00:02:58.510> about<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.130> Seth<00:03:00.400> get<00:03:00.670> but
