hopefully we can get to the top two
I<00:00:25.580> don't<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.730> we've<00:00:26.880> ever<00:00:27.090> had<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.840> bad

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
I don't think we've ever had more bad

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.730 
I don't think we've ever had more bad
publicity<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.609> hate<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.599> drama<00:00:31.289> than

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
publicity or more hate or drama than

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.670 
publicity or more hate or drama than
this<00:00:31.949> past<00:00:32.279> few<00:00:32.579> weeks<00:00:33.140> when<00:00:34.140> people<00:00:34.380> fly<00:00:34.530> me

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
this past few weeks when people fly me

this past few weeks when people fly me
on<00:00:34.800> reddit<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.370> everything<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.180> gets

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
on reddit and everything it really gets

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.970 
on reddit and everything it really gets
old<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.410> usually<00:00:37.559> blame<00:00:37.860> me<00:00:37.950> for

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
old like it will usually blame me for

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520 
old like it will usually blame me for
everything<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.670> used<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.989> sort<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
everything so I'm used to it we sort of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
everything so I'm used to it we sort of
expected<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> cope<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.300> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
expected it we just have to cope with it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
expected it we just have to cope with it
and<00:00:42.629> hopefully<00:00:42.930> prove<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.920> wrong<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> show

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and hopefully prove them wrong and show

for calls right now I'm very comfortable
on<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> team<00:01:22.580> but<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.729> terms<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> playing<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
on the team but in terms of playing I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
on the team but in terms of playing I
don't<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.590> doing<00:01:25.860> most<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
don't know what to be doing most of the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
don't know what to be doing most of the
times<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.939> new<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> same<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.960> I'm

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
times because I'm new to the same so I'm

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
times because I'm new to the same so I'm
just<00:01:28.290> playing<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> listening<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.700> college

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just playing and listening for college

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760 
just playing and listening for college
but<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> calls<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.990> being<00:01:31.200> bad<00:01:31.320> recently

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but the calls that being bad recently

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530 
but the calls that being bad recently
we're<00:01:32.490> having<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:32.970> rough<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
we're having a really rough time and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
we're having a really rough time and
game<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.930> talking<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.650> figuring<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.100> what

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
game be talking and figuring out what

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
game be talking and figuring out what
you<00:01:35.369> need<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.750> probably<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you need to do and that's probably the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.810 
you need to do and that's probably the
most<00:01:37.409> important<00:01:38.009> thing<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> team

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
most important thing because it's a team

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.929 
most important thing because it's a team

the<00:01:50.640> fly<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.210> when

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the fly right now when

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420 
the fly right now when
only<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:52.680> or<00:01:52.710> two<00:01:52.800> people<00:01:52.920> talking

uncertain<00:01:57.240> usually<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.320> would<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.800> something

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
uncertain usually he would say something

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.920 
uncertain usually he would say something
and<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.490> immediately<00:01:59.700> go<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:00.630> stopped

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and we immediately go when he stopped

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
and we immediately go when he stopped
saying<00:02:01.380> stuff<00:02:01.620> when<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:01.920> stops<00:02:02.160> making<00:02:02.430> calls

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
because there's so few weeks remaining

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.600 
because there's so few weeks remaining
so<00:02:18.180> few<00:02:18.390> games<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:18.959> must<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.400> must

to be a very big contender but at the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.199 
to be a very big contender but at the
moment<00:03:01.890> we're<00:03:02.340> not<00:03:02.370> really<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> state<00:03:03.090> to

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
moment we're not really in the state to

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.130 
moment we're not really in the state to
do<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.720> don't<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:05.450> honestly<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.720> no
