00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I guess if you have less gear but i

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.749 
I guess if you have less gear but i
really<00:00:12.929> suggest<00:00:13.110> trying<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.040> torment<00:00:14.519> six

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
defensive gear for it i'm also using a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.300 
defensive gear for it i'm also using a
route<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.170> doesn't<00:00:19.500> require<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.279> have

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
bounty if there's one spawns you also do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
bounty if there's one spawns you also do
it<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:03.870> quickly<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.799> show<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it so I'm quickly going to show you a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
it so I'm quickly going to show you a
run<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.060> would<00:01:06.210> start<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.600> game<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
run so if I would start this game now I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.109 
run so if I would start this game now I
would<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> cursed<00:01:08.790> cellar

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
would be going to the cursed cellar

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
would be going to the cursed cellar
first<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> longest<00:01:11.159> run<00:01:11.400> though

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
first this one is the longest run though

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
first this one is the longest run though
so<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.060> teleporting<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.960> stuff<00:01:13.140> might<00:01:13.320> work

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
so here teleporting and stuff might work

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.010 
so here teleporting and stuff might work
a<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:14.090> you<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.330> follow<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> road

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
a little bit you just follow the road

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
a little bit you just follow the road
the<00:01:16.530> monsters<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.790> weak<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the monsters in here are really weak and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.020 
the monsters in here are really weak and
not<00:01:18.270> dangerous<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.820> run

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
not dangerous so you can really just run

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.260 
not dangerous so you can really just run
past<00:01:21.060> everything<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> seller<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.880> always

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
past everything and the seller is always

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.410 
past everything and the seller is always
in<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.479> location<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:28.520> here<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
in that location and here we are the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.330 
in that location and here we are the
event<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.320> spawns<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.770> lot<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.009> mini<00:01:32.220> zombies

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
event just spawns a lot of mini zombies

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.200 
event just spawns a lot of mini zombies
so<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.630> easy<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.210> killing

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so it's really easy to do and killing

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.840 
so it's really easy to do and killing
100<00:01:36.750> isn't<00:01:37.020> important<00:01:37.439> by<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.829> cuz<00:01:38.159> on

longest to hell height tremors so you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.500 
longest to hell height tremors so you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
might try and group them up a little bit

a<00:04:52.610> spawn<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:54.430> feel<00:04:55.430> like<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.730> act<00:04:55.880> one<00:04:56.300> is<00:04:56.630> the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
a spawn I feel like the act one is the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.010 
a spawn I feel like the act one is the
one<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.530> spawns<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.010> least<00:04:58.870> no<00:04:59.870> I'd

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
because you can just go down here and

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.880 
because you can just go down here and
that's<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:41.260> sometimes<00:05:42.260> there<00:05:42.410> can<00:05:42.560> be<00:05:42.620> in<00:05:42.800> the
