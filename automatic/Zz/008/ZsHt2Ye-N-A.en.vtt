we played at every single night for one
year<00:00:37.120> we<00:00:38.120> actually<00:00:38.270> kind<00:00:38.720> of<00:00:38.750> went<00:00:38.930> out<00:00:39.050> on<00:00:39.230> a

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
year we actually kind of went out on a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.799 
year we actually kind of went out on a
limb<00:00:39.350> with<00:00:39.559> Halo<00:00:39.949> to<00:00:40.309> design<00:00:41.269> each<00:00:41.449> one<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.629> our

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
limb with Halo to design each one of our

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.390 
limb with Halo to design each one of our
multiplayer<00:00:42.260> maps<00:00:42.470> so<00:00:42.620> they<00:00:42.739> fit<00:00:42.980> within<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
multiplayer maps so they fit within the

single<00:00:43.640> player<00:00:43.730> settings<00:00:44.260> so<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:45.290> can<00:00:45.470> look

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
single player settings so you can look

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
at any of our maps and you could say

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.720 
at any of our maps and you could say
wait<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.930> know<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.320> location

we<00:01:01.740> had<00:01:01.950> two<00:01:02.460> bases<00:01:02.970> that<00:01:03.300> were<00:01:03.390> pretty

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
we had two bases that were pretty

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.620 
we had two bases that were pretty
identical<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.620> at<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> beginning<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.150> Halo<00:01:06.390> 2

identical and at the beginning of Halo 2
we<00:01:07.170> were<00:01:07.290> trying<00:01:07.410> to<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.620> of<00:01:07.830> different

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
we were trying to think of different

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.470 
we were trying to think of different
ways<00:01:08.160> where<00:01:08.550> we<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.760> make<00:01:08.880> her<00:01:09.030> match<00:01:09.180> more

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
ways where we can make her match more

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.350 
ways where we can make her match more
asymmetrical<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.860> fun<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.730> play<00:01:11.940> as<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
asymmetrical it's fun to play as the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
asymmetrical it's fun to play as the
attacker<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.200> fun<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> play<00:01:13.650> as

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
attacker and then it's fun to play as

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
attacker and then it's fun to play as
the<00:01:14.010> defender<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> never<00:01:15.120> completely

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the defender you can never completely

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.750 
the defender you can never completely
defend<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.530> base<00:01:16.680> maybe<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.460> two<00:01:17.640> guys

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
defend the base maybe there's two guys

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.790 
defend the base maybe there's two guys
defending<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:18.660> three<00:01:18.900> ways<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
defending but there's three ways in you

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.060 
defending but there's three ways in you
always<00:01:20.010> having<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.370> these<00:01:20.520> choices<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
always having make these choices so the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.960 
always having make these choices so the
attackers<00:01:23.610> start<00:01:23.940> on<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.300> beach<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:26.190> we<00:01:26.820> give

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
attackers start on the beach and we give

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.340 
attackers start on the beach and we give
the<00:01:27.090> attack<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.690> warthog<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.470> two<00:01:29.100> ghosts

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the attack or a warthog and two ghosts

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.690 
the attack or a warthog and two ghosts
then<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.590> give<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.800> defender<00:01:32.220> anything

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
then we don't give the defender anything

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.140 
then we don't give the defender anything
except<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.150> rocket<00:01:33.600> launcher

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 

and<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.570> beach<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.810> separated<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.250> main

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and the beach is separated from the main

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.180 
and the beach is separated from the main
complex<00:01:39.060> by<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.360> sea<00:01:39.870> wall<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.890> gives<00:01:41.010> the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
complex by the sea wall so it gives the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.100 
complex by the sea wall so it gives the
attackers<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.820> home<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.630> defenders

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
attackers at home and then the defenders

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.910 
attackers at home and then the defenders
also<00:01:43.440> have<00:01:43.590> their<00:01:43.830> base<00:01:44.040> which<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> their<00:01:44.670> home

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
also have their base which is their home

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
also have their base which is their home
and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.310> vehicles<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.150> come<00:01:48.330> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and then the vehicles have to come in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.410 
and then the vehicles have to come in
through<00:01:48.660> this<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.990> gate<00:01:50.270> launcher<00:01:51.270> guy

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
through this one gate launcher guy

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.720 
through this one gate launcher guy
usually<00:01:51.780> likes<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.410> get<00:01:52.590> into<00:01:52.830> position<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
usually likes to get into position to

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.680 
usually likes to get into position to
attack<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.720> day<00:01:58.880> Hut<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.300> heads-up

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
attack that day Hut is the heads-up

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.050 
attack that day Hut is the heads-up
