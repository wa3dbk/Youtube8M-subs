is people think proteins front any well
you<00:02:32.810> know<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.350> know<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.590> debate<00:02:34.070> about<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
you know you know this debate about the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.040 
you know you know this debate about the
whey<00:02:34.790> protein<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:35.810> whatever<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.590> gonna<00:02:37.070> bad

know I mean you know I don't know what
Brenda<00:02:47.300> using<00:02:47.600> but<00:02:48.310> just<00:02:49.310> protein<00:02:49.730> you're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
Brenda using but just protein you're

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.030 
Brenda using but just protein you're
putting<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.420> strong<00:02:50.720> point<00:02:50.960> see<00:02:51.560> i<00:02:51.590> was<00:02:51.800> looking

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
putting a strong point see i was looking

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.860 
putting a strong point see i was looking
to<00:02:52.070> study<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.580> other<00:02:52.730> day<00:02:52.880> when<00:02:53.240> they<00:02:53.570> were

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
to study the other day when they were

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.760 
to study the other day when they were
talking<00:02:54.200> about<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:56.720> protein<00:02:57.260> how<00:02:57.560> much

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
talking about you know protein how much

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.960 
talking about you know protein how much
they're<00:02:58.190> looking<00:02:58.370> at<00:02:58.430> two<00:02:58.610> different<00:02:58.730> groups

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
they're looking at two different groups

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.810 
they're looking at two different groups
and<00:02:59.620> they<00:03:00.620> concluded<00:03:01.040> i'm<00:03:01.220> gonna<00:03:01.550> get<00:03:01.700> into

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and they concluded i'm gonna get into

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.740 
and they concluded i'm gonna get into
the<00:03:01.910> details<00:03:02.210> of<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.330> study<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:02.660> they

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
the details of the study but they

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.440 
the details of the study but they
concluded<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.970> somebody<00:03:04.970> who<00:03:05.090> already<00:03:05.120> has

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
concluded that somebody who already has

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.290 
concluded that somebody who already has
muscle<00:03:05.960> mass<00:03:06.110> right<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.710> was<00:03:06.830> already

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
muscle mass right it was already

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.400 
muscle mass right it was already
muscular<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.420> wants<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.690> maintain<00:03:08.930> his

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
muscular and wants to maintain his

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.870 
muscular and wants to maintain his
muscle<00:03:09.830> mass<00:03:09.950> does<00:03:10.190> not<00:03:10.400> need<00:03:10.550> as<00:03:10.700> much

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
muscle mass does not need as much

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.820 
muscle mass does not need as much
protein<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.450> somebody<00:03:11.750> trying<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.080> build

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
protein as somebody trying to build

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.350 
protein as somebody trying to build
muscle<00:03:13.070> gain<00:03:13.490> more<00:03:13.700> muscle<00:03:13.760> my<00:03:14.090> which<00:03:14.240> is

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
muscle gain more muscle my which is

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.360 
muscle gain more muscle my which is
common<00:03:14.660> sense<00:03:14.780> right<00:03:15.020> but<00:03:15.650> if<00:03:15.740> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
common sense right but if this is the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.940 
common sense right but if this is the
show<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.820> somebody<00:03:17.720> who's<00:03:17.900> huge<00:03:18.260> can't

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
show that somebody who's huge can't

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.680 
show that somebody who's huge can't
survive<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.670> 60<00:03:19.970> grams<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.300> protein<00:03:20.480> a
