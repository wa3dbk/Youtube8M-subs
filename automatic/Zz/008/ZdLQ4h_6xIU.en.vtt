00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.629 

okay<00:00:01.500> let's<00:00:01.709> look<00:00:01.770> at<00:00:01.920> clouds<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.370> adding

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay let's look at clouds and adding

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay let's look at clouds and adding
volumetric<00:00:02.970> clouds<00:00:05.779> as<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.899> can<00:00:06.990> see<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> have

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
volumetric clouds as you can see I have

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.620 
volumetric clouds as you can see I have
added<00:00:07.589> one<00:00:08.040> volumetric<00:00:08.730> cloud<00:00:09.179> up<00:00:09.540> here

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
added one volumetric cloud up here

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.850 
added one volumetric cloud up here
the<00:00:12.630> reason<00:00:12.870> volumetric<00:00:13.170> clouds<00:00:13.590> are<00:00:13.740> so

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the reason volumetric clouds are so

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.430 
the reason volumetric clouds are so
effective<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.340> if<00:00:14.549> you're<00:00:14.730> actually<00:00:14.940> flying

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
effective is if you're actually flying

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.120 
effective is if you're actually flying
through<00:00:16.440> them<00:00:17.990> as<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.529> they're<00:00:19.830> not

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
through them as you can see they're not

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
through them as you can see they're not
just<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.520> layer<00:00:20.789> they're<00:00:21.060> actually<00:00:21.390> almost

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
just one layer they're actually almost

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
just one layer they're actually almost
three<00:00:22.500> dimensional<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.310> this

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
three dimensional so how did I do this

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.050 
three dimensional so how did I do this
all<00:00:27.210> step<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.019> went<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.320> entity<00:00:29.060> render

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all step one I went just entity render

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.160 
all step one I went just entity render
cloud<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:33.170> dragged<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.320> cloud<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:35.899> raise<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.079> up

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
cloud I dragged in cloud I raise it up

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.330 
cloud I dragged in cloud I raise it up
to<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> sky<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:40.500> next<00:00:40.739> step<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.160> into

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
to the sky the next step is I'm into

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.290 
to the sky the next step is I'm into
cloud<00:00:41.579> file<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.270> change<00:00:43.140> from<00:00:43.379> default<00:00:44.300> let's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
cloud file and change from default let's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.650 
cloud file and change from default let's
say<00:00:45.539> let's<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.879> cumulus<00:00:47.879> corner<00:00:48.300> leftie

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
say let's go to cumulus corner leftie

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.650 
say let's go to cumulus corner leftie
press<00:00:49.230> open<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.670> next<00:00:50.820> step<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
press open the next step is go to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.410 
press open the next step is go to
materials<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:53.449> open<00:00:54.500> materials<00:00:55.500> menu

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
materials up here open materials menu

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
materials up here open materials menu
then<00:00:57.420> open<00:00:57.510> clouds<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> let's<00:01:00.989> choose<00:01:01.199> base

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
then open clouds and let's choose base

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
then open clouds and let's choose base
clouds<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.129> press<00:01:02.309> apply<00:01:03.110> it's<00:01:04.110> different

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
clouds and press apply it's different

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500 
clouds and press apply it's different
kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> cloud<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.090> choose<00:01:06.270> base

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
kind of cloud there you can choose base

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
kind of cloud there you can choose base
clouds<00:01:06.780> rain<00:01:07.049> apply<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> looks

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
clouds rain apply that see what it looks

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.350 
clouds rain apply that see what it looks
like<00:01:08.540> they're<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> bit<00:01:09.930> darker<00:01:11.030> there's<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.150> hint

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
like they're a bit darker there's a hint

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.620 
like they're a bit darker there's a hint
of<00:01:12.510> rained<00:01:12.840> inside<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:17.360> might<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.450> quite

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of rained inside them might look quite

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.480 
of rained inside them might look quite
nice<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.200> our<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.530> selection<00:01:20.070> level<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
nice for our in selection level that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
nice for our in selection level that
we're<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> make<00:01:20.970> soon<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.890> suits<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
we're going to make soon and suits the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.190 
we're going to make soon and suits the
atmosphere<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> sky<00:01:24.750> box

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
atmosphere as well the sky box

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
atmosphere as well the sky box
the<00:01:25.590> other<00:01:25.740> thing<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the other thing you can do is have the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.130 
the other thing you can do is have the
cloud<00:01:27.119> animated<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.810> what<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.990> do

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
cloud animated so to do this what you do

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.179 
cloud animated so to do this what you do
is<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> come<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.979> auto<00:01:32.189> move<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:34.189> then

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is you come down to auto move and then

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:45.230 
is you come down to auto move and then
with<00:01:38.180> speed<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.930> add<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:41.210> whole<00:01:42.680> into<00:01:44.240> each

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
with speed just add one whole into each

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170 
with speed just add one whole into each
of<00:01:45.540> these<00:01:45.770> places<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> press<00:01:47.850> reload

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of these places here and press reload

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440 
of these places here and press reload
script<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> notice<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.759> cloud<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
script and now you notice the cloud is

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.620 
script and now you notice the cloud is
moving<00:01:54.200> from<00:01:55.790> along<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.820> YX<00:01:57.360> e<00:01:57.600> through<00:01:58.560> here

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
moving from along the YX e through here

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.550 
moving from along the YX e through here
quite<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> nice<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.869> effect<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.869> it's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
quite a nice little effect and it's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.700 
quite a nice little effect and it's
looking<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:04.920> below<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.469> how<00:02:07.649> you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
looking from below and that is how you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
looking from below and that is how you
make<00:02:08.369> volumetric<00:02:09.360> clouds
