a point with the help of my buddies Rick
and<00:01:10.479> Dudley<00:01:10.960> we<00:01:11.439> fired<00:01:11.830> each<00:01:12.189> gun<00:01:12.729> 20<00:01:13.330> times

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
and Dudley we fired each gun 20 times

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.830 
and Dudley we fired each gun 20 times
then<00:01:14.409> check<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.770> see<00:01:15.130> how<00:01:15.340> easily<00:01:15.700> each<00:01:16.390> plug

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
then check to see how easily each plug

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.800 
then check to see how easily each plug
can<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.259> removed<00:01:17.939> okay<00:01:18.939> let's<00:01:19.420> see<00:01:19.630> what

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
can be removed okay let's see what

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.130 
can be removed okay let's see what
happened<00:01:20.490> first<00:01:21.490> Dudley<00:01:22.299> gave<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.720> TC

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
happened first Dudley gave the TC

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.060 
happened first Dudley gave the TC
triumph<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.799> try<00:01:25.439> no<00:01:26.439> luck<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.990> Rick<00:01:29.770> tried

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
triumph a try no luck then Rick tried

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.819 
triumph a try no luck then Rick tried
the<00:01:30.250> traditions<00:01:30.880> pursuit<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:33.430> story<00:01:34.829> okay

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
the traditions pursuit same story okay

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.219 
the traditions pursuit same story okay
so<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.130> was<00:01:36.250> up<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.579> me<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.790> demonstrate<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.720> true

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
so it was up to me to demonstrate a true

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.600 
so it was up to me to demonstrate a true
easy<00:01:38.590> removal<00:01:39.579> breech<00:01:39.880> plug<00:01:40.180> here<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.140> go<00:01:41.610> just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
easy removal breech plug here we go just

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.569 
easy removal breech plug here we go just
what<00:01:42.790> I<00:01:42.820> thought<00:01:43.060> we'd<00:01:43.329> see<00:01:43.649> easy<00:01:44.649> finger

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
what I thought we'd see easy finger

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.539 
what I thought we'd see easy finger
removal<00:01:46.119> you<00:01:47.020> know<00:01:47.170> folks<00:01:47.500> even<00:01:47.740> though<00:01:48.100> TC

with the QR breech plug system comes
with<00:01:58.750> no<00:01:59.079> tools<00:01:59.380> because<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.130> never<00:02:00.280> need<00:02:00.610> a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
with no tools because you never need a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
tool to remove a breech plug so why do

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.429 
tool to remove a breech plug so why do
you<00:02:03.579> think<00:02:03.729> TC<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.450> traditions<00:02:04.990> include

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
you think TC and traditions include

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.570 
you think TC and traditions include
tools<00:02:05.829> with<00:02:06.670> their<00:02:06.880> tools<00:02:07.270> free<00:02:07.810> system<00:02:08.320> I

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
tools with their tools free system I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.460 
tools with their tools free system I
think<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.730> can<00:02:09.910> figure<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.240> one<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
think you can figure that one out the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.680 
think you can figure that one out the
CVA<00:02:11.860> QR<00:02:12.430> breech<00:02:12.670> plug<00:02:12.910> system

it's<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.380> system<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.950> really<00:02:15.490> works<00:02:15.790> i'll

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
it's the system that really works i'll

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.050 
it's the system that really works i'll
be<00:02:16.750> using<00:02:16.960> my<00:02:17.260> QR<00:02:17.680> breech<00:02:17.950> plug<00:02:18.220> equipped<00:02:18.670> cba

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060
