00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.800
 hello guys here febre and in a new 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.870
 video are a call is who is 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.519
 wilder that serves to give them who 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:13.299
 your users or yours 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.689
 the bad thing about this plugin so that even to 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.759
 Sometimes you do not recognize the corner 100% 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.590
 example in this case is worth the one who has 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.789
 are you who have some colors because 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.829
 normal very simple but something I do not know 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.369
 who is that they are more elaborate and that 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:33.250
 they do not usually come out they do not usually come out as you see 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.390
 almost all of these are easy 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.100
 then for mine for example if you 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 a bus leaves but well I will not explain here 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.880
 there is a video equal and good 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.490
 we are going to need about this permission 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.640
 so that people can create the xs themselves 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.640
 do not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.970
 well I'm going to put this here 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.410
 and now let's see the configuration the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.360
 configuration is very simple 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.180
 this is so that it is automatic to be 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.710
 Automatically updates the plugin 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.130
 this is so that you for example create my 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.170
 skin of place and 11 with flash skin 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.470
 and of post you change the 15 that is 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.560
 batman to be updated if it 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.030
 we put in true but I would update you 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 it's always the factor nothing would stay 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.869
 how is it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.960
 and then later if I wanted to put the new 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.690
 skin you would put skin federations 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.060
 would declare the batman skin and good 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.220
 this is for them to update 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.220
 formally recommend foolishness before 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.320
 well now let's go here 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.870
 You see this one who is also the one who is worth I go 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 to continue up here I do not want to be 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.740
 believe down there and well let's put is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.230
 that I will not leave these commands 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 in quotes and now let's put the 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.920
 febre skin and in three seconds we 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 would do here you see the body is perfect 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.690
 ok but the face fails but well my 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.690
 face is super easy 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:16.140
 to fix what is called nonsense a 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.140
 skin efe breaks and 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.430
 the skin Bracey and good to put the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.970
 address later how do you want the west 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.910
 for example west and it would come out for this no 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.440
 for the other side for this side is worth 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 so that your kim is almost 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.090
 perfect 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.750
 and then putting in the site that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.930
 you want because I guess the colors 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.930
 all right 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.319
 it is created for this is the north for here 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.420
 this is the north 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.690
 but this you know how the kids go 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.520
 already explained 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.960
 to erase a corner let's put the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.050
 skin 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.750
 a 2 and until you are going to save the skin the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.190
 last that put in this one no longer 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.920
 I would erase it, you will have to erase it with 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.260
 ax 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.130
 now let's put skin breaks and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.540
 and now let's put screen 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.280
 it is very look would change this is worth 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.260
 as the color that I have between 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.879
 face quotes 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.209
 it's not for anyone else more effects is king 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.209
 live ' 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.450
 is to create the chair corner 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.430
 I'm going too high and I'm going to 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.750
 deny him 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.189
 the 15 break acronyms to create the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.680
 Crystal I really like the colors of 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:55.860
 crystal after is 15 breaks and to which it is 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.770
 all colors 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.230
 a good potpourri I think that this would be 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.970
 the one that would most approach who 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.819
 the manchuela I think the first but 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.150
 good 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.019
 and good guys, I'm going to approve this 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.019
