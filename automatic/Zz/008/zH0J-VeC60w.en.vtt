00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 very good girls who are so welcome to the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.350
 room video from the reckoning f in the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.200
 which I am going to show you the four new ones 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.900
 multiplayer maps fracture over load 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.759
 quarantine and of course shuar in my 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.730
 intention with this video guys is that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.070
 you learn the map in a general way 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
 not that you learn all the places that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 it obviously comes because it is impossible 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.050
 in every minute and a half that you are going to have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.609
 of each map but pussy you get unit 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.859
 how big is the sites that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.849
 they have the corridors heights and so on 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.949
 when a minute and a half you see 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
 perfectly and apart if the map has 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.300
 some element special streak element 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.219
 dynamic that we already saw in the trailer 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 I tried to put it in this time for 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.270
 Enjoy it, we start with the map 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.040
 of fracture you already know set in the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 arctic in an excavation and its element 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 dynamic is that on the left 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.160
 according to the camera that we have right now 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 Well, it is destroying a little bit the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 ice to see is not an element of my 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 friend who says to be in a little way 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.090
 transform the map by the part 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.920
 left then goes creating as 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.359
 platforms are moving the little things 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.500
 to the left but it's not good either 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.229
 nothing great but there it is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 simply so that you see it I explain to you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.300
 guys my intention every time 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 a tlc went out or went up in a game 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.560
 private moving around the map 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.540
 just so you could see my first 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.950
 printing and also so that I what 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 learn since private party 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.160
 turning around I think it's the best 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.050
 way to see a little the map and 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.240
 get an idea of ​​how it is that happens 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.000
 this time it's different if you saw 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.010
 yesterday's video the blog you already know that a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.020
 I will be in Germany 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.460
 what happened that prevented me 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.780
 Well, the games went up 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 private because that's because it was going to be 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 in germany and this one says nothing about greece 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.509
 Call me crazy but if you can not access 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.610
 to private games because there was no 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.040
 mister of telefe like cojones is me 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 extracting gameplay in the background against another 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.440
 people are me 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.119
 is an application already because it's going to 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.530
 bring a neck vein I am 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.020
 quiet since I exploited you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 fijaros lafitte say this that permeated 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.340
 belonging to my xbox one this example and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.380
 belongs to private events that makes 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.840
 activision to capture the vélez 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.509
 it's ahead of time and what youtubers 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.729
 selected let's say then have the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.680
 gameplays already saved the case you've 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.660
 October engraving has no engraving 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.730
 I practically did not have time this 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.750
 gameplay is from my great friend youtuber 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.760
 concert the current 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.410
 has marked there totally impressive 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.210
 this is the quarantine map and it has the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.130
 special element that you shoot at 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.750
 the plasma towers and if there are enemies 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.370
 around then you download but ojito 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.130
 that you can also play a bad 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.080
 passed to the end of the clip of this map 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 let's say what are you going to see how it continues 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.050
 saying I'm fucking grateful to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.090
 my colleague youtuber english presstv skate 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.980
 I explained what was happening to me I said hear 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.810
 uncle, look, I'm going to germany on that day 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.790
 I know you fear the gameplay two new 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.760
 maps that good activision I invite you and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.530
 you would care to leave it to me and tell me 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.390
 no problem tivo the truth the uncle 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.010
 supermajo is that guys I'm 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.480
 eternally grateful because if not 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.650
 it would have been for him 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.060
 Of course you have a channel of the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.400
 description and gives the option that is 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.570
 English time you spend you give him the support of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.880
 think about me because really if there was not 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.320
 been for him today I do not upload anything from the tlc 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.420
 I would have just gone to Germany and 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.430
 much improved the issue of leaving the channel 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.470
 without df videos that are times that I 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 I put it very hard, I can not be an uncle 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.790
 after uploading the trailers after 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.190
 good to talk about the dlc and everything I feel 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.080
 very bad without uploading them later thanks to 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 he has it here I can take the 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.750
 third map quarantine this map 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 how much gameplay is not painted 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.110
 pretty good and I do not call 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.549
 personally the map of the bananas 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.890
 by some attention the little girl who is 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.299
 here to start the prestige is the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.159
 key is the host kills three 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.920
 people going there and put in Dublin 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.629
 the little ball of venga continue with 600 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.670
 guys to me this map I like to call it 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.549
 the map of the plane trees because if you 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.250
 you see there are strange 20 placed all over 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.530
 the map boxes of banana bananas 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.659
 how do you want to call it if such is the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.280
 fucking map of the bananas for that and 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.959
 then you know that its dynamic element 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.370
 good the reason why there are boxes of 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.680
 bananas do not ask me because I 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.000
 I think that sledgehammer knows it and then 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.889
 you know that the dynamic element that is 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.319
 saw deliver totally out of place 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.170
 out of the technology that we have for 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.389
 creating video games in 2015 is a thing 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.000
 what level is that the platform 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.670
 in the middle of the map as it starts to 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.109
 to sink you go crazy and stay crazy with 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.209
 the element and graph that I am who does not 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.889
 has seen nothing more spectacular my mother 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.019
 here the soil begins to sink there 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.449
 incredible in the two tables and that is 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.039
 I never saw anything like it because AIDS 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.419
 guys, I'll explain to you a little bit how 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.250
 this works when they invite the 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.350
 people to try the dlc 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.810
 ask for curiosity Prestige and I 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.930
 He said that good he insinuated I told him 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.620
 hey it may be that when you are going to approve the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.060
 tlc with these profiles you have everything 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.130
 unlocked and effectively guys 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.410
 you imagine god I have a 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.470
 profile activates the two maps and results 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.090
 that you have all all the things 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.690
 unlocked and with everything I mean 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.490
 weapons dress everything absolutely everything 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.780
 and of course it's cool a lot because 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.910
 gameplays that you are watching in the background 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.830
 because the Mongol are with the blunderbuss 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.150
 dragon fire or elite that I do not 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.100
 agreement how it is but it takes a dragon that 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.870
 it looks a lot like the legendary yes with 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.060
 the steg reilly that yes with ls I see 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.220
 resources in of you know a variety of 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.200
 weapons and elite and legendary models 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.169
 of the host so well we are already 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.510
 with the last map suar the only map in 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.150
 which have put in a special streak 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.890
 as a conclusion before throwing it 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.500
 I can say that probably for me 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.400
 these are the least maps 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.860
 spectacular that have gotten up to the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.590
 date in a call of japan sugar dlc 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.270
 farc comparing it with others I 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.250
 I would have liked it in the room of the f 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.360
 we had at least one remake that 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.150
 it was 6 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.729
 on the map of compound de rus nos site 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.400
 spectacular elements that the 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.280
 maps none a spectacular element 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.080
 for example is the streak of 6244 that 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.000
 alien streak that is the host but 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.069
 here that we have a streak in the four 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.560
 maps and you'll see below is 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.719
 the swarm of drones that is a potato 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.250
 hot but totally awesome 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:59.669
 that is a garbage that you are going to flip 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.439
 when you see the guy piloting what you are 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.210
 to understand why I say this that by 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.400
 true the gameplay of the drones no longer 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.900
 It is prestige and it is that it does not contribute 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.430
 xxix that is a friend of his that I do not 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.840
 I speak directly with him we know each other 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.400
 but he also left me the gameplay 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.560
 so you have works in the description 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.599
 also how are you saying guys in 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.789
 conclusion the maps of the times not 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.650
 I've played some of them they have 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.349
 a cool gameplay but no site is 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.819
 your last dlc the quarter of lg 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.460
 why do not you put me a remake of rus 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:29.490
 because you will not see me a map with a 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:33.029
 totally amazing streak whatever 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.830
 of 130 something like in 6244 but more at 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.779
 beast ong more treated than that no no 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.300
 I think I can get in but I do not know guys 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.250
 something more spectacular and in these four 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.380
 maps that 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.480
 they're fine but fuck this whatever the 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.070
 second dlc the third of l after it is worth 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.720
 I approve it but the fourth of the effect 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.580
 where more spectacular has to be 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.770
 everything to leave a good taste in my mouth 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.240
 you put this in us guys I'm not 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.670
 all in agreement this is my opinion 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.040
 leave me yours in the comments and 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.770
