00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.380
 rafa has been your first games 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.650
 after your injury having been 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.659
 outside so much time in your experience the 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.740
 biggest challenge has been physical or 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:23.449
 rather psychological when going back to being 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.430
 well as competing in a tournament 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.340
 great good after all the 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.599
 problems and challenges because first of all 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.360
 instead they are physical they can not be the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.280
 problem that has kept me out of the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.900
 competition that has been the knee this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.570
 is the most important problem is the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.309
 physical not after the mental problem does not 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.750
 I believe that at all times accepted 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.910
 within what fits the situation 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.180
 moments better times worse 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.370
 you can imagine after being many 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.390
 months waiting to play again 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.760
 matches we're playing today 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.680
 but good the wait is always worth the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.280
 and we have worked hard to return 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 to be here and here we are better or worse 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.350
 here we are and the important thing is that the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.080
 sensations go better to daily 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.750
 you feel that there has been something positive about 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.050
 have taken a break of 7 8 months 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.490
 positive there are always positive things there 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.220
 they always say that there is no harm 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.950
 well do not come 'no, maybe that helped me and 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.229
 maybe this helps me to lengthen my 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.240
 race that's always an option not 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.920
 I believe that after many years 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 playing practically without ceasing 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.619
 a mental level break at the physical level 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.630
 I believe that it is not bad without any doubt 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.340
 Now obviously, if you ask me 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.330
 to me as an athlete as a competitor 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 I would have liked to be 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.600
 competing 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.850
 in Mexico you have a group of fans that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.540
 they adore you and you take off your shirt and it's 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.240
 like crazy I think we have a lot 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.730
 a lot of support and good we wish you everything 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 better hope you can go back to 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.180
