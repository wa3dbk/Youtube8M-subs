00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.580
 you asked us for a recipe 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 simple to share with family I propose 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 a recipe based on the host and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.500
 sit at the table we go then it's 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.969
 left 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.529
 we will start with the sauce 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.940
 at the table so if it's really a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.939
 thing that I like of course this fish 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 but super simple look I have a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.350
 little casserole 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
 I put a little butter as soon as 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.680
 it starts to melt I already have a small 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.149
 just about heat on medium fire okay 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.140
 I put finely chopped shallots 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.600
 up and I get them back for three 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.770
 four minutes that's while the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.180
 butter and autralie founded with the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 shallots are coming back 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 gently a small cube broth then 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.539
 bouillon cube of fish but I like 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.070
 a small cubic bouillon of poultry 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.410
 okay is actually what's going 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.270
 give a little bit of matter and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.350
 taste to your chili sauce is like that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.760
 you always go in vain gussin 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.170
 disagree here we let it simmer 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.880
 shallots the small cube broth and the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.650
 butter for three four minutes 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 and here I am going to add a little glass of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.299
 dry white wine so if you do not like the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 dry white wine also where the atmosphere is 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.110
 not you can add a little rets 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.670
 the title we are a little bit of water 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 if we ever do what we are looking for 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.360
 to acidity in the sauce is heated to 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.119
 boil the dry white wine and we go 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 let the six reduce to one 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 consistency a little syrupy in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.189
 do what we seek is to evaporate 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.600
 the alcoholic side and actually to keep 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.490
 just the acidity and the scent of the wine 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.799
 so that children will be able to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.500
 obviously taste this source 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.439
 I put a little trickle of oil at the bottom 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 of the casserole 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.820
 I have medallions of monkfish 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.500
 France then there we fishmonger was 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.320
 very nice he prepared them a little 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.320
 paved about 45 grams I put 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.689
 pavers by person and here i'm going 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 start to slightly salt with the flower 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.770
 of salt here and I will leave 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.170
 wait a few minutes the time that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.600
 my hot pot 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.580
 here is my dry white wine is almost 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.670
 evaporated I will add cream 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 fresh liquid then whole or 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.399
 liquids so you're a guy at 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.560
 diet you take to lighten it ap no 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.420
 okay okay and you'll wear 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.730
 this source a failure to boil 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.110
 to a napping consistency during 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 that my sauce is trying to be 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 boiled and translated 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.239
 until a big wait 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.430
 I have my small batch pavers slightly 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.100
 salted with fleur de sel I have my casserole 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.970
 who is hot and he begins to 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.350
 to be steaming and I pose delicately and 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.360
 then had monkfish in the bottom of the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.269
 casserole and we will color 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.650
 by against high heat for one minute on 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.650
 each face the voting pieces 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.549
 my sauce 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.709
 and with a nap consistency we can say 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.159
 that it has a consistency a little bit 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.909
 of custard look here it is 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.220
 wish to drag him here is the slope 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.760
 I take the opportunity to taste it on stage 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.689
 impeccable thanks to the cube broth 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.599
 I'm going to pour mascot on my note on 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.609
 cover one goes out of the fire and cooking 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.650
 will end nicely with inertia 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.000
 with the heat you will wear 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.859
 place on your you will share with 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.359
 rice for example or steamed apples 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.099
 and you will enjoy it 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.540
 really a family dish then you 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.620
 have seen I'm going to say this sauce she 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.120
 is really unbeatable and then you 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.379
 can make full up variants and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.519
 you always have fun and then
