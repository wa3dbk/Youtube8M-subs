for now and I thought you know I haven't
really<00:00:18.930> done<00:00:19.080> any<00:00:19.260> video<00:00:19.500> yet<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.070> parts

really done any video yet of the parts

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
really done any video yet of the parts
or<00:00:20.520> anything<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.600> using<00:00:21.810> this

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
or anything like that but I'm using this

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.920 
or anything like that but I'm using this
new<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.439> cutoff<00:00:22.650> -<00:00:22.949> oh<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.930> forget

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
new little cutoff - oh I got I forget

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.589 
new little cutoff - oh I got I forget
who<00:00:25.109> suggested<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.000> man<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.210> thing<00:00:27.449> is

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
who suggested it man this thing is

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.700 
who suggested it man this thing is
awesome<00:00:28.789> it<00:00:29.789> uses<00:00:30.210> inserts<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.660> this

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.990 

they<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:38.040> mount<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> side<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> half

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
they they mount to the side of the half

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
they they mount to the side of the half
inch<00:00:39.240> bar<00:00:39.450> holder<00:00:39.780> here

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
inch bar holder here

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.360 
inch bar holder here
this<00:00:42.150> looks<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.450> an<00:00:42.600> N<00:00:42.750> Co<00:00:42.960> label<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.130> I'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this looks like an N Co label so I'm

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
this looks like an N Co label so I'm
gonna<00:00:44.490> guess<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.320> they<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:46.560> from<00:00:46.620> n

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
gonna guess that that they got it from n

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.460 
gonna guess that that they got it from n
Co<00:00:46.950> maybe

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.380 

1/2<00:00:56.470> inch<00:00:56.710> shank<00:00:57.040> mini<00:00:57.370> system<00:00:57.850> groove<00:00:58.150> and

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
1/2 inch shank mini system groove and

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.150 
1/2 inch shank mini system groove and
cutoff<00:00:58.600> kit<00:00:59.040> set<00:01:00.040> 5<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:02.260> when<00:01:02.410> I<00:01:02.440> put<00:01:03.040> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
cutoff kit set 5 and and when I put the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.560 
cutoff kit set 5 and and when I put the
first<00:01:03.310> bit<00:01:03.610> in<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:03.880> didn't<00:01:04.180> pay<00:01:04.330> any<00:01:04.480> attention

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
first bit in I didn't pay any attention

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.450 
first bit in I didn't pay any attention
I'm<00:01:05.230> guessing<00:01:05.800> all<00:01:05.890> these<00:01:06.070> different<00:01:06.370> numbers

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
I'm guessing all these different numbers

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.510 
I'm guessing all these different numbers
here<00:01:06.670> 0.9<00:01:08.100> 1.1<00:01:09.100> 1.3<00:01:09.640> 1.6<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.450> 1.85<00:01:11.190> those<00:01:12.190> are

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
here 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.6 and 1.85 those are

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.070 
here 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.6 and 1.85 those are
millimeters<00:01:13.150> I'm<00:01:13.570> sure<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.400> widths<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:17.050> I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
millimeters I'm sure of the widths so I

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.900 
millimeters I'm sure of the widths so I
started<00:01:17.770> out<00:01:17.890> with<00:01:18.280> I'm<00:01:19.030> guessing<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.600> 1.85

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
started out with I'm guessing the 1.85

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.790 
started out with I'm guessing the 1.85
and<00:01:21.910> I<00:01:22.360> kind<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.630> cut<00:01:23.020> some<00:01:23.200> I'm<00:01:23.500> cutting

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
and I kind of cut some I'm cutting

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.350 
and I kind of cut some I'm cutting
stainless<00:01:24.250> steel<00:01:24.430> tubing<00:01:24.760> is<00:01:24.850> what<00:01:24.970> I'm<00:01:25.060> doing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
stainless steel tubing is what I'm doing

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.749 
stainless steel tubing is what I'm doing
here's<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.380> part<00:01:26.649> now<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.070> all<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.490> code

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
here's the part now and all the code

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.719 
here's the part now and all the code
I've<00:01:27.970> written<00:01:28.330> for<00:01:28.600> doing<00:01:28.810> these<00:01:28.899> things<00:01:29.140> I've

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
I've written for doing these things I've

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.050 
I've written for doing these things I've
has<00:01:30.729> been<00:01:30.910> all<00:01:31.149> mine<00:01:31.810> 90<00:01:32.500> 95<00:01:32.800> percent<00:01:33.310> from

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
has been all mine 90 95 percent from

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.550 
has been all mine 90 95 percent from
scratch

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
scratch

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.290 
scratch
instead<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.460> using<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.759> Wizards<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:39.300> anyway

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
instead of using the Wizards but anyway

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.520 
instead of using the Wizards but anyway
I<00:01:40.330> thought<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.570> guys<00:01:40.690> like<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:41.020> see<00:01:41.200> how<00:01:41.320> well

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
I thought you guys like to see how well

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.260 
I thought you guys like to see how well
this<00:01:41.680> thing<00:01:41.740> cuts<00:01:42.130> now<00:01:42.340> I'm<00:01:42.790> not<00:01:43.030> quite<00:01:43.240> sure

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
this thing cuts now I'm not quite sure

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
this thing cuts now I'm not quite sure
what<00:01:43.660> what's<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.350> there<00:01:44.500> now<00:01:47.220> 1<00:01:48.220> point<00:01:48.430> 1<00:01:49.380> yep

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
what what's in there now 1 point 1 yep

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.100 
what what's in there now 1 point 1 yep
so<00:01:51.790> let's<00:01:52.030> let's<00:01:52.420> check<00:01:52.660> this<00:01:52.780> out<00:01:52.960> I've

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
so let's let's check this out I've

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.710 
so let's let's check this out I've
written<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.410> code<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:54.009> can<00:01:56.039> sit<00:01:57.039> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
written the code so that I can sit the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.810 
written the code so that I can sit the
part<00:01:58.720> length<00:01:58.930> here<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:01.000> when<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.150> started<00:02:01.630> it'll

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
part length here so when I started it'll

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.840 
part length here so when I started it'll
move<00:02:03.390> over<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.940> can<00:02:05.940> pull<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.300> piece<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.850> can

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
move over I can pull the piece out I can

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.969 
move over I can pull the piece out I can
get<00:02:09.420> cycle<00:02:09.810> start<00:02:09.990> again<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.440> pause<00:02:10.680> in

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
get cycle start again I put a pause in

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.750 
get cycle start again I put a pause in
the<00:02:11.010> nem<00:02:11.220> zero<00:02:11.460> one<00:02:11.700> pause<00:02:13.130> that's<00:02:14.130> exactly

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the nem zero one pause that's exactly

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.150 
the nem zero one pause that's exactly
where<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> wanted<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> bill<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:20.040> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
where I wanted it to bill so I have it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.730 
where I wanted it to bill so I have it
come<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.550> pause<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.270> M<00:02:21.390> 0<00:02:21.660> 1<00:02:21.870> then<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.530> hit

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
come up pause on an M 0 1 then I hit

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.560 
come up pause on an M 0 1 then I hit
cycle<00:02:23.100> start<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.580> tell<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.060> move<00:02:24.210> back

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
cycle start and I tell it to move back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.270 
cycle start and I tell it to move back
and<00:02:24.600> pause<00:02:25.080> again<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:26.610> way<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.820> can<00:02:27.090> start<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and pause again this way I can start the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.310 
and pause again this way I can start the
spindle<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.720> coolant<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
spindle and the the coolant and

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.310 
spindle and the the coolant and
everything<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.630> proceed<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.110> cut

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
everything and then proceed with the cut

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.190 
everything and then proceed with the cut
so<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.370> waiting<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.180> M<00:02:36.300> 0<00:02:36.570> 1<00:02:36.720> pause<00:02:36.960> right

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
so it's waiting on an M 0 1 pause right

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900 
so it's waiting on an M 0 1 pause right
now<00:02:37.230> I'll<00:02:37.980> turn<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.340> stuff<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:38.760> I'll

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
now I'll turn this stuff on I'll

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.250 
now I'll turn this stuff on I'll
probably<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.300> cut<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> audio<00:02:39.630> off<00:02:40.130> but

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
probably have to cut the audio off but

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.980 
probably have to cut the audio off but
I'll<00:02:43.260> do<00:02:43.650> I'll<00:02:44.100> do<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> couple<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.720> see

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
I'll do I'll do a couple so you can see

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.540 
I'll do I'll do a couple so you can see
it<00:02:46.140> from<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.530> distance<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.100> then<00:02:47.190> see<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.460> up

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
it from a distance and then see it up

00:02:47.550 --> 00:03:03.140 
it from a distance and then see it up
close

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.089 

nice

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
nice

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.179 
nice
so<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.849> leaves<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.629> just<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.200> tiny<00:03:08.739> little

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
so it leaves just a just a tiny little

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.140 
so it leaves just a just a tiny little
bird<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.719> easily<00:03:11.549> check<00:03:12.549> off<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.760> letter

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
bird I can easily check off that letter

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:24.869 
bird I can easily check off that letter
by<00:03:13.569> hand<00:03:13.900> now<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:14.829> need<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.189> dang<00:03:23.849> got<00:03:24.849> a

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
by hand now I need the dang got a

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:32.640 
by hand now I need the dang got a
magnetic<00:03:26.219> extendable<00:03:27.219> magnet<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.500> what<00:03:32.620> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
magnetic extendable magnet and what I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.599 
magnetic extendable magnet and what I
what<00:03:33.219> I<00:03:33.250> did<00:03:33.609> was<00:03:34.499> I'm<00:03:35.499> having<00:03:35.859> trouble<00:03:36.189> still

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
what I did was I'm having trouble still

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.429 
what I did was I'm having trouble still
having<00:03:36.909> trouble<00:03:37.209> getting<00:03:38.109> this<00:03:38.200> thing

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
having trouble getting this thing

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.190 
having trouble getting this thing
repeatable<00:03:38.980> with<00:03:39.639> making<00:03:40.329> tool<00:03:40.480> changes<00:03:40.870> so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
repeatable with making tool changes so

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.209 
repeatable with making tool changes so
I've<00:03:41.290> done<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.769> in<00:03:42.010> steps<00:03:43.680> with<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.769> same<00:03:44.980> tool

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:45.219 
I've done it in steps with the same tool

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.839 
I've done it in steps with the same tool
okay<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.359> cut<00:03:46.689> these<00:03:46.840> slugs<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.699> know<00:03:48.790> to

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
okay so I cut these slugs to you know to

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.000 
okay so I cut these slugs to you know to
the<00:03:49.030> length<00:03:49.209> they<00:03:49.389> were<00:03:49.449> with<00:03:50.290> this<00:03:50.530> with<00:03:50.889> the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
the length they were with this with the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.330 
the length they were with this with the
other<00:03:51.159> cutter<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:51.579> this<00:03:51.760> system<00:03:53.159> did<00:03:54.159> all

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
other cutter but this system did all

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.309 
other cutter but this system did all
those<00:03:54.579> then<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.060> came<00:03:55.389> in<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:55.719> I<00:03:55.810> did<00:03:56.049> all<00:03:56.199> the

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
those then I came in that I did all the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.679 
those then I came in that I did all the
boring<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.739> what<00:03:56.889> I<00:03:56.919> did<00:03:57.129> was<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.599> went<00:03:58.599> ahead

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
boring and what I did was I went ahead

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.080 
boring and what I did was I went ahead
because<00:03:59.469> I<00:03:59.500> needed<00:03:59.799> a<00:04:00.159> certain<00:04:00.849> amount<00:04:00.969> of

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
because I needed a certain amount of

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.789 
because I needed a certain amount of
length<00:04:01.329> there<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.629> be<00:04:01.719> able<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.930> grab<00:04:02.199> to<00:04:02.560> cut

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
length there to be able to grab to cut

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.080 
length there to be able to grab to cut
off<00:04:02.919> the<00:04:03.069> final<00:04:03.280> piece<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:06.280> made<00:04:06.790> them<00:04:06.909> long

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
off the final piece I I made them long

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.409 
off the final piece I I made them long
enough<00:04:07.389> that<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.019> could<00:04:08.139> flip<00:04:08.469> it<00:04:08.590> over<00:04:08.709> okay<00:04:09.639> so

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
enough that I could flip it over okay so

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.759 
enough that I could flip it over okay so
now<00:04:10.599> what<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.810> can<00:04:10.989> do<00:04:11.109> is<00:04:11.259> I<00:04:11.379> can<00:04:11.439> I<00:04:13.590> can<00:04:14.590> just

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
now what I can do is I can I can just

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.420 
now what I can do is I can I can just
flip<00:04:14.979> that<00:04:15.129> over<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.530> come<00:04:17.799> in<00:04:17.979> here<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.280> it

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
flip that over and come in here and it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.300 
flip that over and come in here and it
won't<00:04:18.789> be<00:04:20.489> why<00:04:21.489> as<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.620> run<00:04:23.860> out<00:04:23.889> it'll<00:04:24.159> be<00:04:24.220> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
won't be why as the run out it'll be a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.800 
won't be why as the run out it'll be a
little<00:04:24.490> more<00:04:24.639> it'll<00:04:24.820> wobble<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.330> little<00:04:25.539> more<00:04:26.729> I

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
little more it'll wobble a little more I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.390 
little more it'll wobble a little more I
don't<00:04:28.810> really<00:04:28.960> care<00:04:29.259> for<00:04:29.320> what's<00:04:29.740> being<00:04:30.159> done

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
don't really care for what's being done

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.710 
don't really care for what's being done
what's<00:04:30.639> being<00:04:30.789> used<00:04:30.880> everything<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.570> that

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
what's being used everything like that

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.210 
what's being used everything like that
it<00:04:31.810> doesn't<00:04:31.960> matter<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:32.349> then<00:04:32.500> we'll<00:04:32.979> cut<00:04:33.190> off

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
it doesn't matter so then we'll cut off

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:49.070 
it doesn't matter so then we'll cut off
the<00:04:33.430> other<00:04:33.580> side<00:04:33.789> here

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.770 

okay<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.330> something<00:04:51.330> else<00:04:51.419> you<00:04:51.479> might<00:04:51.599> want<00:04:51.750> to

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
okay so something else you might want to

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.969 
okay so something else you might want to
know<00:04:51.900> -<00:04:51.960> its<00:04:53.900> I'm<00:04:54.900> running<00:04:55.199> this<00:04:55.289> at<00:04:55.530> over

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
know - its I'm running this at over

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.089 
know - its I'm running this at over
1,400<00:04:56.610> rpms<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:57.810> it's<00:04:58.289> maxed<00:04:58.650> out<00:04:58.740> with<00:04:58.770> how

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
1,400 rpms it's it's maxed out with how

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.779 
1,400 rpms it's it's maxed out with how
its<00:04:59.310> set<00:04:59.520> up<00:04:59.610> right<00:04:59.789> now<00:04:59.909> so<00:05:00.680> 1430<00:05:01.789> basically

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
its set up right now so 1430 basically

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.999 
its set up right now so 1430 basically
is<00:05:02.940> what<00:05:03.509> it<00:05:03.539> is<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.870> my<00:05:04.229> feed<00:05:04.500> rate<00:05:04.710> into

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
is what it is and my feed rate into

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.909 
is what it is and my feed rate into
there<00:05:05.220> is<00:05:05.750> 1.5<00:05:06.750> inches<00:05:07.620> per<00:05:07.800> minute<00:05:07.830> okay

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
there is 1.5 inches per minute okay

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.939 
there is 1.5 inches per minute okay
yeah<00:05:10.919> this<00:05:11.069> is<00:05:11.220> 1/2<00:05:11.430> inch<00:05:11.699> so<00:05:12.889> somebody<00:05:13.889> else

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
yeah this is 1/2 inch so somebody else

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.439 
yeah this is 1/2 inch so somebody else
can<00:05:14.190> figure<00:05:14.370> out<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.639> math<00:05:14.669> on<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.120> surface

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
can figure out the math on the surface

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.869 
can figure out the math on the surface
speaker<00:05:18.860> you<00:05:19.860> know<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:20.129> stainless<00:05:20.789> is

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
speaker you know the stainless is

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.670 
speaker you know the stainless is
darkening<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.389> little<00:05:21.629> bit<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.199> parts<00:05:22.469> aren't

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
darkening a little bit the parts aren't

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.580 
darkening a little bit the parts aren't
getting<00:05:22.860> hot<00:05:23.039> or<00:05:23.190> anything<00:05:23.219> so<00:05:23.879> I<00:05:24.560> kind<00:05:25.560> of

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
getting hot or anything so I kind of

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
geometry is a whole lot different with a

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.790 
geometry is a whole lot different with a
pushing<00:05:51.050> in<00:05:51.170> that<00:05:51.650> was<00:05:51.800> okay<00:05:53.380> plus<00:05:54.380> two<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.590> had

shoot<00:05:58.880> video<00:05:59.270> if<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.420> do<00:05:59.480> some<00:05:59.720> more<00:05:59.870> we'll<00:06:00.230> see

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
shoot video if I do some more we'll see

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.690 
shoot video if I do some more we'll see
so<00:06:01.280> we'll<00:06:01.460> pull<00:06:01.610> it<00:06:01.700> away<00:06:01.840> tighten<00:06:02.840> it<00:06:02.900> up

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
so we'll pull it away tighten it up

00:06:04.700 --> 00:08:01.239 
so we'll pull it away tighten it up
let's<00:06:05.360> zoom<00:06:05.660> in<00:06:05.870> here

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:01.249
