another test umm Ali your test is all
done<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.630> can<00:01:23.780> come<00:01:23.990> back<00:01:24.170> now

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.920 

maybe<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.670> should<00:02:05.700> better<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.810> what

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
maybe we should better go see what

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
maybe we should better go see what
happens<00:02:07.049> no<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:08.130> environment<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.729> too

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
happens no this environment is too

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.999 
happens no this environment is too
unstable<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:09.720> could<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:09.990> destroyed<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
unstable they could get destroyed you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
strange I don't know what it's doing it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.760 
strange I don't know what it's doing it
it<00:02:17.160> seems<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.569> may<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.900> making<00:02:19.440> some

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
it seems like it may be making some

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.550 
it seems like it may be making some
decisions<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.520> itself<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.720> she<00:02:21.840> did<00:02:22.260> choose

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
decisions for itself so she did choose

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.860 
decisions for itself so she did choose
to<00:02:22.709> come<00:02:22.830> out<00:02:23.010> here<00:02:23.040> my<00:02:23.610> lip<00:02:23.819> test<00:02:24.090> worked<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
to come out here my lip test worked you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570 
to come out here my lip test worked you
can't<00:02:25.170> prove<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.530> until<00:02:26.069> we<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.459> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
can't prove that until we can get it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.280 
can't prove that until we can get it
back<00:02:26.730> into<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.150> place<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.600> can<00:02:27.810> control

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
back into a place where we can control

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.650 
back into a place where we can control
it<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.100> highly<00:02:29.580> doubt<00:02:29.730> your<00:02:29.910> bouncy<00:02:30.270> castle

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
it and I highly doubt your bouncy castle

00:02:30.660 --> 00:03:14.870 
it and I highly doubt your bouncy castle
test<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.989> what<00:02:31.110> caused<00:02:31.380> this

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.940
