 Slow down and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.719

 know point base 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.730
 weighty yawn a mother member 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.790
 speed limits of 60 kilometers here 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.790
 with a new eye and which 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.920

 also think that 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.110
 This base appeared not without participation

 and on behalf of all Belgorod citizens who have 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:45.000
 in its use of radar detectors

 sho-me 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.460

 here today ride checked 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.280
 the most problematic radars that are 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.280
 in our city 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.270
 again and base 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.270
 for a new test firmware 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.270
 October 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.920

 well end 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.460
 today luba radar detector whose 800-900 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.789
 located 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.789
 panels 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.289
 for better visual perception 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.390
 so you can shoot on 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.760
 DVR 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:00.220
 which I already tortured all honest 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.220
 constantly freezes constantly comes 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.970
 as it happened 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.120
 I want to notice 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.070
 my personal 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.569
 I usually have an opinion 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.390
 this reactor on 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:23.180
 at the top of the windshield 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.960
 personally my opinion personally my observation 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.380
 what's the range 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.180
 radar disturbance during installation 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.030
 up 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.450
 it is better 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.450
 farther
