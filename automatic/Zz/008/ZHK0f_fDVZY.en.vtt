00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hi all youtubers friends today are 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.470
 here to show you a tweak that speeds up 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.110
 apple iphone and ipad 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.389
 well this video as foreword is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 exclusively for illustrative purposes we do not 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.660
 damage to the count you want ed ed 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.600
 I also don't take responsibility 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.380
 of any kind of irremediable problem 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.090
 well first we have to look into the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 ours is looking for a little problem called 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 accelerated is free and is bigboss 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.170
 as always he is hacked and he is not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.920
 recommended to do it well this applies 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.690
 this valid ds3 onwards think a little e 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.520
 when installing and confirming and yes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.750
 will reopen the springboard will appear 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.940
 within your settings 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.670
 of your any settings 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.550
 of each iphone you will have to speed up with 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
 no cona to activate it black 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 speed up shaun are the various modes 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 of acceleration exists year from the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.290
 ferrari that rather fast and more 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 fast that you don't even see that changes me 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.010
 I had to fast because I am enough so I am 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 slower success such as the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 homer simpson who are really a lot 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.369
 scorching 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 and then there are speed for example 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.590
 the even slower one you even see 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.200
 to make disappear the cyclic touch of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 time, however, these speeds work 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.189
 when changing from one page to another 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.549
 not for example when it turns out that yes 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.299
 he discovered the gloss immediately without problems 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.610
 however for example for those who have an ipod 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.370
 an iphone a slow ipad just put 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.560
 speed on and however 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.360
 maybe in those bugs they could leave 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 because here perhaps with passes from a 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.440
 page to another and so on 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.300
 then not only can it be used in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
 screenshots as you have seen here but so far 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.570
 it can be used to do many others 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.970
 things like when they open they close 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.440
 apps are faster when you are 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.500
 pass from the first if the application i 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.000
 advisers and so on 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.690
 I hope this video gets into this 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 video I was clear and I hope there is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.360
 also liked hello to everyone from above 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.360
