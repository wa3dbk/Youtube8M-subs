00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
get that 45-yard field goal I think it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
get that 45-yard field goal I think it
really<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.509> switched<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> tempo<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
really would have switched the tempo of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.499 
really would have switched the tempo of
the<00:01:20.130> game<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.610> bit<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.970> he<00:01:21.119> did<00:01:21.299> miss

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the game a little bit but he did miss

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.760 
the game a little bit but he did miss
that<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.200> something<00:01:22.350> he's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that one so that's just something he's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
that one so that's just something he's
got<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.130> consistent<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.840> continue<00:01:24.840> on

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
