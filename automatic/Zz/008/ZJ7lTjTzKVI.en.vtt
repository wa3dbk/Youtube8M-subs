that's the yield from one section of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's the yield from one section of
tripling<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:03.720> can<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:04.110> there's<00:02:04.290> nice

tripling you can see there's nice

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.850 
tripling you can see there's nice
marbling<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.280> there<00:02:06.470> marbling<00:02:07.470> helps<00:02:07.740> with

marbling in there marbling helps with

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.460 
marbling in there marbling helps with
the<00:02:07.950> flavor<00:02:08.190> obviously<00:02:09.050> what<00:02:10.050> are<00:02:10.170> some<00:02:10.200> other

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

which when it comes from let fall the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.100 
which when it comes from let fall the
short<00:02:16.709> loin<00:02:17.660> essentially<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> t-bone

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
short loin essentially the t-bone
