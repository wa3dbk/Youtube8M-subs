00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
does slide up and down the frame to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.860 
does slide up and down the frame to
accommodate<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.610> Sun<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:17.970> any<00:03:18.120> angle<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.630> my

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
growing child plus it folds all the way

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.150 
growing child plus it folds all the way
down<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.049> front<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.440> your<00:03:22.560> child<00:03:22.739> let's<00:03:23.040> say

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
down in front of your child let's say

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.070 
down in front of your child let's say
it's<00:03:23.310> windy<00:03:23.700> or<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.209> block<00:03:24.540> them<00:03:24.780> from<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
it's windy or to block them from the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.710 
it's windy or to block them from the
elements<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.220> great<00:03:26.459> option<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.390> do

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
elements so that is a great option to do

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.470 
elements so that is a great option to do
and<00:03:28.110> if<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.980> canopy<00:03:29.730> isn't<00:03:30.120> quite<00:03:30.299> large

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and if this canopy isn't quite large

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.210 
and if this canopy isn't quite large
enough<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.830> do<00:03:31.980> is

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
enough for you all you have to do is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.789 
enough for you all you have to do is
unzip<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.390> you're<00:03:33.930> going<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.110> expose<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
unzip it and you're going to expose the

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.580 
unzip it and you're going to expose the
third<00:03:35.100> panel<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:36.239> makes<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.690> even<00:03:36.870> larger<00:03:37.230> so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
third panel that makes it even larger so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
third panel that makes it even larger so
this<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> full<00:03:38.549> coverage<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:39.090> be<00:03:39.269> Cybex

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
this is a full coverage can be Cybex

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.539 
this is a full coverage can be Cybex

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
for 2011 and in that position it folds

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.280 
for 2011 and in that position it folds
down<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.610> front<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.120> them<00:03:45.239> too<00:03:45.420> which<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.780> great
