screen real estate you get with this

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.740 
screen real estate you get with this
it's<00:05:23.020> kind<00:05:23.260> of<00:05:23.320> not<00:05:23.530> even<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.800> competition<00:05:25.440> so

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
it's kind of not even a competition so

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
for the best right that's too much and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.990

as<00:06:26.020> far<00:06:26.170> as<00:06:26.230> virgin<00:06:26.680> mobile's<00:06:27.040> network<00:06:27.130> I'm<00:06:27.790> in

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
as far as virgin mobile's network I'm in

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.970 
as far as virgin mobile's network I'm in
my<00:06:28.120> basement<00:06:28.390> and<00:06:28.750> nothing<00:06:29.530> works<00:06:29.710> down<00:06:29.950> here

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
but overall virgin is pretty much sprint

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.950 
but overall virgin is pretty much sprint
if<00:06:35.500> you<00:06:35.620> look<00:06:35.740> at

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
if you look at

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.439 
if you look at
this<00:06:37.199> network<00:06:38.069> here<00:06:38.460> you'll<00:06:38.910> see<00:06:39.000> the<00:06:39.210> same

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
this network here you'll see the same

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.559 
this network here you'll see the same
bars<00:06:40.139> on<00:06:40.440> here<00:06:40.680> as<00:06:40.800> I<00:06:40.979> have<00:06:41.220> there<00:06:41.569> so

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
bars on here as I have there so

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.180 
bars on here as I have there so
Motorola's<00:06:43.259> not<00:06:43.410> getting<00:06:43.650> any<00:06:43.770> better<00:06:43.979> or

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
Motorola's not getting any better or

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.249 
Motorola's not getting any better or
worse<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.940> GPS<00:06:45.360> I've<00:06:45.539> found<00:06:45.660> actually<00:06:45.930> is

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
worse the GPS I've found actually is

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.170 
worse the GPS I've found actually is
better<00:06:46.590> on<00:06:46.919> the<00:06:47.819> motorola<00:06:48.210> phone<00:06:48.569> then

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
better on the motorola phone then

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.140 
better on the motorola phone then
certainly<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.270> samsung<00:06:51.840> but<00:06:52.169> also<00:06:52.319> the

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
certainly the samsung but also the

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.900 
certainly the samsung but also the
optimist<00:06:54.150> so<00:06:54.509> if<00:06:54.630> you're<00:06:54.750> big<00:06:55.020> maps<00:06:55.560> user<00:06:55.910> had

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
optimist so if you're big maps user had

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.760 
optimist so if you're big maps user had
not<00:06:57.360> just<00:06:57.599> the<00:06:57.720> screen<00:06:58.020> on<00:06:58.169> his<00:06:58.319> phone<00:06:58.530> but

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
not just the screen on his phone but

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.339 
not just the screen on his phone but
also<00:06:58.919> the<00:06:59.220> gps<00:06:59.610> is<00:06:59.639> a<00:06:59.849> lot<00:07:00.060> stronger<00:07:00.360> or<00:07:00.810> at

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:01.349 
also the gps is a lot stronger or at

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.999 
also the gps is a lot stronger or at
least<00:07:01.500> it<00:07:01.680> felt<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:03.319> as<00:07:04.319> far<00:07:04.530> as<00:07:04.590> things<00:07:04.889> i

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.009 
least it felt so as far as things i

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.240 
least it felt so as far as things i
would<00:07:05.160> like<00:07:05.310> to<00:07:05.430> see<00:07:05.580> change<00:07:06.560> these<00:07:07.560> a<00:07:07.590> sharp

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
would like to see change these a sharp

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.520 
would like to see change these a sharp
edges<00:07:08.490> I<00:07:08.940> mean<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.900> screen<00:07:10.139> is<00:07:10.229> going<00:07:10.410> almost

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
edges I mean the screen is going almost

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.290 
edges I mean the screen is going almost
all<00:07:10.770> the<00:07:10.860> way<00:07:10.889> to<00:07:10.979> the<00:07:11.160> edge<00:07:11.280> and<00:07:11.460> screens<00:07:12.120> are

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
all the way to the edge and screens are

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.960 
all the way to the edge and screens are
squares<00:07:12.660> so<00:07:12.900> you're<00:07:13.020> not<00:07:13.110> going<00:07:13.259> to<00:07:13.349> get<00:07:13.970> too

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970 
squares so you're not going to get too

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.540 
squares so you're not going to get too
much<00:07:15.000> better<00:07:15.870> here<00:07:16.259> but<00:07:16.470> rounded<00:07:17.160> edges<00:07:17.430> would

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
much better here but rounded edges would

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.150 
much better here but rounded edges would
have<00:07:17.669> been<00:07:17.789> nicer<00:07:18.740> this<00:07:19.740> is<00:07:19.919> incredibly<00:07:20.460> thin

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 
have been nicer this is incredibly thin

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.290 
have been nicer this is incredibly thin
but<00:07:23.160> that<00:07:24.120> the<00:07:24.449> build<00:07:24.780> quality<00:07:26.120> because<00:07:27.120> it's

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
but that the build quality because it's

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.390 
but that the build quality because it's
it's<00:07:27.750> got<00:07:27.960> rubber<00:07:28.199> all<00:07:28.409> on<00:07:28.650> the<00:07:28.740> outside<00:07:29.130> it

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
it's got rubber all on the outside it

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.089 
it's got rubber all on the outside it
feels<00:07:29.729> a<00:07:30.300> little<00:07:30.449> bit<00:07:30.659> cheap<00:07:31.050> even<00:07:31.560> though<00:07:31.770> it

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 
feels a little bit cheap even though it

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.450 
feels a little bit cheap even though it
is<00:07:32.780> not<00:07:33.780> that<00:07:34.020> it's<00:07:34.440> not<00:07:34.680> been<00:07:34.889> cheap<00:07:35.159> in<00:07:35.310> any

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 
is not that it's not been cheap in any

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.100 
is not that it's not been cheap in any

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
way it hasn't fallen and broken or or

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.999 
way it hasn't fallen and broken or or
anything<00:07:40.110> like<00:07:40.139> that<00:07:40.259> and<00:07:40.500> it's<00:07:40.620> also<00:07:40.770> pretty

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009 
anything like that and it's also pretty

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.670 
anything like that and it's also pretty
light<00:07:41.360> it's<00:07:42.360> much<00:07:42.509> lighter<00:07:42.720> than<00:07:42.840> the<00:07:43.020> evo<00:07:43.380> and

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 
light it's much lighter than the evo and

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.550 
light it's much lighter than the evo and
it's<00:07:44.280> similar<00:07:45.210> to<00:07:45.330> an<00:07:45.630> HR<00:07:45.960> X<00:07:46.080> actual<00:07:46.470> is

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 
it's similar to an HR X actual is

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.230 
it's similar to an HR X actual is
probably<00:07:46.949> the<00:07:47.070> best<00:07:47.250> comparison<00:07:47.639> of<00:07:49.159> foams

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 
probably the best comparison of foams

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.200 
probably the best comparison of foams
the<00:07:51.240> atrix<00:07:51.930> obviously<00:07:52.409> is<00:07:52.530> a<00:07:52.560> little<00:07:52.800> lighter

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.210 
the atrix obviously is a little lighter

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.330 
the atrix obviously is a little lighter
and<00:07:54.210> smaller<00:07:54.570> but<00:07:56.750> so<00:07:57.750> that's<00:07:57.960> the<00:07:58.340> motorola

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 
and smaller but so that's the motorola

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.730 
and smaller but so that's the motorola
