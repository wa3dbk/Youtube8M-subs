red from this column LED flash right
always<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.080> because<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.130> always<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:51.520> I'm

personally<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.450> because<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.380> a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
personally is because they have a

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.020 
personally is because they have a

for<00:03:12.070> anyone<00:03:12.550> because<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.390> my<00:03:13.510> other
