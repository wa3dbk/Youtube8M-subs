 I'm going to present you with very good news 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.490
 because a project presented by 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.460
 young engineers of the university 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.520
 Mayor of San Andres 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.410
 project presented to the nasa is between 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.809
 the five best in the world see it 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 seven young engineers recently 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.860
 graduates of the university major of san 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.900
 AndrÃ© received the news on Monday 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.060
 that your project presented in the space 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.130
 of silence of the nasa be among the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.070
 five of the world's best within the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 category of best mission concept 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 nomination they got after the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.620
 evaluation of academics and engineers 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.540
 the nasa is to say that during these two 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.239
 weeks after the space apps a jury 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.860
 international assessed all of the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 project we had done including 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 the documentation that we had uploaded to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.670
 internet and sent and they decided that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.590
 our project was within the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.239
 five best the project presented by 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.640
 the Bolivian engineers in this event 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.410
 where groups of 138 participated 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 cities of the world proposes a swarm 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 of robots for the exploration of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.539
 surfaces in space either 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 we arrive or we are not very satisfied with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.860
 our performance and with the development 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.119
 of the idea this group of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.190
 engineers that represents the country 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.759
 Compete with Finnish engineers 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.890
 Mexico and Chile Germany on 9 May 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.080
 will know which project is the winner of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.860
 challenge of the nasa we are at a level 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 d 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.690
 of international competition and that's what 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.690
 important that our ideas are taken 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.490
 in account and that we can 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.740
 go ahead and we can show what 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.260
 I mean Bolivians have intelligence 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.180
 and we can excel in the competitions 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.290
 international not the career of 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.660
 electronic engineering of the university 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.310
 Mayor of San Andres highlights the work that 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.690
 meet the professionals who graduate from 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.130
 this superior house of studies 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.810
 then I would like to take advantage of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.810
 ATV cameras and thank them 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.050
 summon the state to the entire state 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.120
 Bolivian because this is the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.550
 representation of bolivia stops being the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.860
 representation of the use stops being the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.490
 engineering representation tronic and it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.110
 becomes the representation of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.110
 Bolivia in the international context
