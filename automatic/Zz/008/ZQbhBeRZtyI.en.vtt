pretty<00:02:37.590> small<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.000> wanted<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.330> try<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.660> on

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
pretty small but I wanted to try this on

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.850 
pretty small but I wanted to try this on
a<00:02:40.050> small<00:02:40.350> scale

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
a small scale

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370 
a small scale
my<00:02:41.250> theory<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> worm<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:43.050> know<00:02:43.200> how

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
my theory is as a worm don't know how

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.680 
my theory is as a worm don't know how
big<00:02:43.590> his<00:02:43.709> home<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.100> only<00:02:44.940> he<00:02:45.030> got<00:02:45.209> something<00:02:45.600> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
big his home is only he got something to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.800 
big his home is only he got something to
eat<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.350> he's<00:02:50.130> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.570> make<00:02:51.570> worm

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
eat you know he's going to make worm

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.110 
eat you know he's going to make worm
poop<00:02:52.050> which<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.410> good<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.890> garden<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.210 

make<00:02:57.120> babies<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:58.260> you're<00:02:58.410> winning<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
make babies but you're winning the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.250 
make babies but you're winning the
animal<00:02:59.640> livestock<00:03:00.300> whatever<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.110> have

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
animal livestock whatever that you have

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
animal livestock whatever that you have
is<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.239> what<00:03:03.480> they<00:03:03.600> produce<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
is you know what they produce and and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.199 
is you know what they produce and and
reproduce<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.150> anyway<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> little

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
reproduce so anyway this is a little

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.090 
reproduce so anyway this is a little
torch<00:03:09.570> lighter<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.140> got<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.860> this

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
torch lighter that I got I like this

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.699 
torch lighter that I got I like this
thing's<00:03:11.340> pretty<00:03:11.610> cool<00:03:12.290> everybody<00:03:13.290> uses

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
thing's pretty cool everybody uses

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.110 
thing's pretty cool everybody uses
knives<00:03:13.920> I'm<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.459> use<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.970> open

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
knives I'm going to use this to open

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.690 
knives I'm going to use this to open
this<00:03:15.390> item<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.900> all<00:03:16.560> right

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.120 

now<00:03:20.700> isn't<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.090> cool<00:03:23.210> all<00:03:24.210> right<00:03:24.270> well

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
now isn't that cool all right well

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.470 
now isn't that cool all right well
that's<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.430> I'll<00:03:26.700> take<00:03:27.060> some<00:03:27.270> more<00:03:27.420> pictures

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480

little totes here these are the lid he's
this<00:04:00.390> little<00:04:00.750> kit<00:04:01.380> here<00:04:01.830> cost<00:04:04.040> five<00:04:05.040> bucks

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.860 

it's<00:04:08.250> what<00:04:08.460> they<00:04:09.060> look<00:04:09.270> like<00:04:10.250> I'm<00:04:11.250> going<00:04:11.460> to

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
it's what they look like I'm going to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.160 
it's what they look like I'm going to
put<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.050> media<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.890> here<00:04:14.630> get<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.780> starter

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
put the media in here get the starter

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.750 
put the media in here get the starter
ones<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.710> here<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.900> then<00:04:20.030> as<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.570> fills<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:22.760> say

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
ones in here and then as it fills up say

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.950 
ones in here and then as it fills up say
gets<00:04:24.030> up<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:24.540> line<00:04:24.840> right<00:04:25.200> here<00:04:26.540> my<00:04:27.540> plan

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
gets up to this line right here my plan

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.550 
gets up to this line right here my plan
is<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.860> set<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.730> next<00:04:30.660> one<00:04:31.910> in<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.420> far<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.470> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
is to set the next one in that far and I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.000 
is to set the next one in that far and I
know<00:04:34.590> there's<00:04:34.980> going<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.190> be<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.370> gap<00:04:35.760> there<00:04:37.010> but

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
know there's going to be a gap there but

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.590 
know there's going to be a gap there but
I<00:04:38.040> think<00:04:38.190> it'll<00:04:38.610> be<00:04:38.790> all<00:04:38.910> right<00:04:39.150> we'll<00:04:39.420> just

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
I think it'll be all right we'll just

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.220 
I think it'll be all right we'll just
set<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.080> right<00:04:40.320> on<00:04:40.380> top<00:04:40.830> holes<00:04:42.050> drilled<00:04:43.050> in

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
set that right on top holes drilled in

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.810 
set that right on top holes drilled in
this<00:04:43.410> right<00:04:43.650> here<00:04:43.920> I'll<00:04:44.130> drill<00:04:44.460> several

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
this right here I'll drill several

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.140 
this right here I'll drill several
several<00:04:45.360> holes<00:04:45.540> in<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:47.610> when<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.850> set

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
several holes in this and when you set

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.670 
several holes in this and when you set
that<00:04:48.330> on<00:04:48.390> top<00:04:48.690> there<00:04:48.930> then<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.200> can<00:04:49.350> just<00:04:49.500> get

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
that on top there then you can just get

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.290 
that on top there then you can just get
scrap<00:04:50.010> in<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.670> and<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:52.350> worms<00:04:53.000> will<00:04:54.000> move

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
scrap in this and the worms will move

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.560 
scrap in this and the worms will move
upward<00:04:54.960> into<00:04:55.230> this<00:04:55.650> level<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.700> they'll

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
upward into this level and they'll

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.540 
upward into this level and they'll
consume<00:04:58.020> everything<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.680> here<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.220> then<00:04:59.400> when

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
consume everything in here and then when

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.080 
consume everything in here and then when
they<00:04:59.670> what<00:04:59.910> they<00:05:00.060> leave<00:05:00.270> here<00:05:01.010> then<00:05:02.010> I'll<00:05:02.130> set

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
they what they leave here then I'll set

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.880 
they what they leave here then I'll set
the<00:05:03.210> next<00:05:03.390> one<00:05:03.630> on<00:05:03.840> top<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.320> I'll<00:05:04.380> drop<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.770> on

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
the next one on top and I'll drop it on

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.270 
the next one on top and I'll drop it on
top<00:05:05.040> then<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:06.000> can<00:05:06.180> just<00:05:06.360> take<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.660> bottom<00:05:07.050> one

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
top then we can just take the bottom one

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.950 
top then we can just take the bottom one
out<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.840> dump<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.190> in<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.460> inner<00:05:11.820> garden<00:05:12.210> and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
out and dump it in the inner garden and

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.040

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.340 
should thrive in here and if I can
figure<00:06:06.610> this<00:06:06.910> thing<00:06:06.970> out<00:06:07.360> on<00:06:07.570> a<00:06:07.600> small<00:06:07.990> scale

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
figure this thing out on a small scale

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.760 
figure this thing out on a small scale
and<00:06:09.310> you<00:06:10.030> and<00:06:10.240> your<00:06:10.390> home<00:06:10.600> reproduce<00:06:11.260> this<00:06:11.530> if

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
and you and your home reproduce this if

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.370 
and you and your home reproduce this if
you<00:06:11.890> can<00:06:12.100> do<00:06:12.280> this<00:06:12.490> on<00:06:12.700> a<00:06:12.730> small<00:06:12.970> scale<00:06:13.380> it's

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
you can do this on a small scale it's

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.220 
you can do this on a small scale it's
easier<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:15.280> learn<00:06:15.660> when<00:06:16.660> you<00:06:16.750> have<00:06:16.870> minimal

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
easier to learn when you have minimal

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.470 
easier to learn when you have minimal
investment<00:06:19.260> so<00:06:20.260> that's<00:06:20.860> my<00:06:21.040> plan<00:06:21.480> minimal

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
investment so that's my plan minimal

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.720 
investment so that's my plan minimal
investment<00:06:22.690> if<00:06:23.140> I<00:06:23.260> vote<00:06:23.500> for<00:06:23.650> this<00:06:23.830> five<00:06:24.460> bucks

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
investment if I vote for this five bucks

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.070 
investment if I vote for this five bucks
for<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.060> organic<00:06:25.810> media<00:06:26.530> and<00:06:27.390> that's<00:06:28.390> good<00:06:28.630> to

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
for the organic media and that's good to

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.900 
for the organic media and that's good to
have<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.320> worms<00:06:29.530> something<00:06:30.130> to<00:06:30.220> go<00:06:30.400> on<00:06:30.580> in<00:06:30.790> the

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
have the worms something to go on in the

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.870 
have the worms something to go on in the
very<00:06:31.120> first<00:06:31.810> container<00:06:32.290> and<00:06:32.950> then<00:06:33.490> we'll<00:06:33.700> just

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
very first container and then we'll just

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.610 
very first container and then we'll just
grow<00:06:34.390> from<00:06:34.690> there<00:06:34.930> and<00:06:35.140> see<00:06:35.260> how<00:06:35.410> this<00:06:35.560> thing

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
grow from there and see how this thing

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.300 
grow from there and see how this thing
goes

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
goes

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.840 
goes
