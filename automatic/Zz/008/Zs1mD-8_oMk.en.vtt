00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
coming in here which was the whole idea

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.580 
coming in here which was the whole idea
to<00:03:52.620> save<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:52.950> energy<00:03:53.459> cost<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:55.200> lights<00:03:55.410> are

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
to save this energy cost the lights are

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.880 
to save this energy cost the lights are
all<00:03:56.690> automatic<00:03:57.690> if<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.019> walk<00:03:58.230> into<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.709> room
