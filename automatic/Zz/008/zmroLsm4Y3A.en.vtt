00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.389
 225 160 laps a days a superstate in 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.610
 the same 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 frank thrown by in February is 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.049
 a limited edition because it's good 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.350
 a patent of the 13m mark are not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.119
 respective, but respond according to the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.210
 amount of light that they have now truly 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.160
 has shown how to see and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.939
 understand what we mean create the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939
 cause effect 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.520
 then you can notice quite clearly how 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.750
 changes color according to the amount of light 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.060
 what has 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.400
 or as they have more quantity 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.610
 of light that hits the shoe 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.590
 to cause this effect totally 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.870
 multicolored is not reflective but is 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.989
 responsible is not the simple fact that 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.059
 refracts light but the fact that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 more light will cause 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.559
 greater effect and here is quite clear 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.980
 they have it in all the inferences of the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.220
 sneaker where it shows 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.550
 with returning the box certain details 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 of the shoes like me name of 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.900
 before the exit name is not 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.240
 derived from a snake that is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.730
 original grace that has this same 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.470
 color that is, there are no blacks but it is going 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.810
 to put it as a multicolor and also 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.940
 it responds according to the amount of light that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.800
 have if they are superstar areas 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.260
 classic how could I make them from organdy 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.090
 itself but has the details very 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.390
 characteristic as if it were a 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.390
 snake 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.590
 will open its confessional loan 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.130
 from a led flash to a light are black 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.800
 that is, it is very clear how it looks but if 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.800
 start to give a little light 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.810
 now the subject of one of them in 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.300
 silver can see that the material 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.560
 covers all the shoes and if it 's a 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.720
 illustration or a snake that is the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.720
 snake on which this is based 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.690
 s are not three different models 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.750
 we have the superstar these are the most 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.940
 cheap if they always get them and 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.810
 when they get them so 110 dollars 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.260
 then decide the zx that are like more 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.360
 decorative that's 120 and finally 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.920
 are the meters are more comfortable installments 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.330
 of season heil and that comes out 140 dollars and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.550
 this model because I am a fan the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.550
 Superstar of 8 tries to collect 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.640
 without a doubt, he was the one who wanted 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.400
