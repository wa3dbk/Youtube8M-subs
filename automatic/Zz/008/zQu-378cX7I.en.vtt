00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.609 
balloon he trained and he leads with his
Swampert<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:15.089> both<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.719> both<00:00:15.750> set<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.320> rocks

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
Swampert but both we both set up rocks

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.429 
Swampert but both we both set up rocks
because<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.400> don't<00:00:18.090> really<00:00:18.180> care<00:00:18.480> about<00:00:18.630> his<00:00:18.990> eq

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
because I don't really care about his eq

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.250 
because I don't really care about his eq
since<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.859> am<00:00:20.039> flying<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> balloon<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.480> now

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
since I am flying on a balloon and now

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.810 
since I am flying on a balloon and now
I'm<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> hidden<00:00:23.130> power<00:00:23.400> grass

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
I'm gonna go for the hidden power grass

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
I'm gonna go for the hidden power grass
and<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.930> he<00:00:25.050> didn't<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.470> coming

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and I think he didn't see that coming

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.890 
and I think he didn't see that coming
because<00:00:26.340> he<00:00:26.400> stays<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.330> goes<00:00:27.570> through<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
because he stays in and goes through a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.320 
because he stays in and goes through a
roar<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:29.010> wasn't<00:00:29.189> expecting<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.820> kill<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
roar and I wasn't expecting to kill it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380 
roar and I wasn't expecting to kill it
and<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.720> didn't<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> he<00:00:32.130> rolls<00:00:32.880> me<00:00:33.090> into<00:00:33.270> my

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and it didn't so I he rolls me into my

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.110 
and it didn't so I he rolls me into my
shofu<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.920> expert<00:00:35.309> belt<00:00:35.579> nasty

I'm gonna switch out into my spiky

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.119 
I'm gonna switch out into my spiky
vagina<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.989> risking<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.620> kill<00:00:52.829> him<00:00:52.980> with

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
vagina not risking not to kill him with

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.119 
vagina not risking not to kill him with
flamethrower<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.300> my<00:00:55.199> notorious<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.770> mixed

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
flamethrower and my notorious a mixed

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.090 
flamethrower and my notorious a mixed
wall<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.640> he<00:00:56.820> takes<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.590> signal<00:00:58.590> beam<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
wall so he takes the signal beam and I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
wall so he takes the signal beam and I
don't<00:00:59.489> see<00:00:59.789> any<00:01:00.030> item<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> plus<00:01:01.590> he<00:01:01.770> takes<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
don't see any item and plus he takes the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.700 
don't see any item and plus he takes the
Stealth<00:01:02.879> Rock<00:01:03.000> damage<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> means<00:01:04.140> he's<00:01:04.439> not

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Stealth Rock damage so it means he's not

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
Stealth Rock damage so it means he's not
a<00:01:05.100> magic<00:01:05.610> guard<00:01:06.060> uh<00:01:06.450> he<00:01:07.049> doesn't<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.409> magic

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a magic guard uh he doesn't have magic

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
a magic guard uh he doesn't have magic
guard<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.610> stay<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
guard so I just stay in and go for the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.820 
guard so I just stay in and go for the
spikes<00:01:10.500> thinking<00:01:11.040> he<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.990> specs<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.590> he

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
spikes thinking he is on specs but he

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.530 
spikes thinking he is on specs but he
goes<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> focus<00:01:14.729> blast<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.240> i'm

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
goes for a focus blast and now i'm

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.870 
goes for a focus blast and now i'm
predicting<00:01:16.080> him<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> play<00:01:16.650> safe<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.700> for

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
predicting him to play safe and go for

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.090 
predicting him to play safe and go for
the<00:01:17.909> ex<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.750> mean<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> signal<00:01:19.740> beam<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the ex I mean for the signal beam to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.609 
the ex I mean for the signal beam to
kill<00:01:20.310> me<00:01:20.430> off<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.270> he<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:21.990> doesn't

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
kill me off but he actually doesn't

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
kill me off but he actually doesn't
which<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> weird<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.729> opinion<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.330> anyways

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
which is weird in my opinion but anyways

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.580 
which is weird in my opinion but anyways
he<00:01:25.229> misses<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.250> switch<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.759> my<00:01:26.790> iron<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
he misses on the switch to my iron and I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
he misses on the switch to my iron and I
killed<00:01:29.189> him<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> accessor<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.720> I'm

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
killed him with the accessor because I'm

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.380 
killed him with the accessor because I'm
fast<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.320> hell<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.820> Miss<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.210> gay

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
fast as hell so I'm that Miss was gay

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.020 
fast as hell so I'm that Miss was gay
but<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:34.770> gonna<00:01:34.920> miss<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.400> stone<00:01:35.700> edge<00:01:35.880> on

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
but now I'm gonna miss my stone edge on

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.510 
but now I'm gonna miss my stone edge on
his<00:01:36.210> incoming<00:01:36.689> rapidash<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:37.950> probably

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
his incoming rapidash which probably

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
his incoming rapidash which probably
makes<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.110> he<00:01:40.220> predicts<00:01:41.220> my

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
makes up for it and he predicts my

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
makes up for it and he predicts my
switching<00:01:41.790> ghost<00:01:42.000> room<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> double<00:01:42.990> edge

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
switching ghost room for a double edge

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
switching ghost room for a double edge
and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> doesn't<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.130> much<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and it doesn't do much because I'm a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.620 
and it doesn't do much because I'm a
steel<00:01:45.180> type<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.680> next<00:01:47.040> um<00:01:47.450> next<00:01:48.450> stone

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
steel type and the next um next stone

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
steel type and the next um next stone
edge<00:01:48.780> which<00:01:49.140> luckily<00:01:49.380> doesn't<00:01:49.829> miss<00:01:49.979> kills

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
edge which luckily doesn't miss kills

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.980 
key
and<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.560> go<00:02:11.740> into<00:02:11.920> my<00:02:12.280> bulky<00:02:13.000> Rotom<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.660> get<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
and I go into my bulky Rotom to get the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.710 
and I go into my bulky Rotom to get the
willow<00:02:14.200> wisp<00:02:14.410> off<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.980> seeing<00:02:15.490> his<00:02:15.850> set<00:02:16.480> I'm

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
willow wisp off and seeing his set I'm

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.380 
willow wisp off and seeing his set I'm
assuming<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.380> last<00:02:17.620> move<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.120> roost<00:02:19.120> which

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
assuming the last move is roost which

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.600 
assuming the last move is roost which
means<00:02:19.690> he<00:02:19.900> can't<00:02:20.140> really<00:02:20.350> touch<00:02:20.650> my<00:02:20.980> Heatran

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
means he can't really touch my Heatran

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.090 
means he can't really touch my Heatran
because<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.090> still<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.470> balloon<00:02:23.830> not
