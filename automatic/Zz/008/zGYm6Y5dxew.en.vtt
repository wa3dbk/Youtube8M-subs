 colors and this is a black tone this of 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.999

 pearl more or less as well as if you have like 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:54.999

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:01.740

 God willing until the next video 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.460
 bay 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.070
 Let's start by applying a test 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.310
 in all our eyelid I will be 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.770
 using this nix which is the tone 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.570
 white and good let's try to 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.530
 blur it very well so that we do not 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.830
 there are lumps in this makeup and good 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.600
 since we blend well I 'm going to help 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.140
 with a ribbon because I want the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.350
 lines look good and I'm going to apply 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.020
 this color of visu that is number 3 of 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.360
 visu and this I'm going to use it as 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.060
 transition shadow and we're going to 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.960
 Apply on all our eyelid 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.300
 trying to blur it very well from 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.480
 according to the color we want afterwards 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.750
 you can apply this tone that is like a 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.090
 silver gray and we will apply it in the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.480
 fold of our mobile eyelid but 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.459
 we're just going to do it in the middle 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.709
 and we are going to try to apply it is 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.290
 enough shadow so that it remains 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.830
 pretty strong then I'll take that tone 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.769
 blue and I'm going to apply it in the 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.470
 corner of our eyelid trying to 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.810
 blur it very well and lift it towards 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.090
 above remember that this shadow has 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.330
 to go more or less to half of the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.549
 eyelid as we apply the 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.400
 shadow let's go pulling it little by little 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.489
 more inward but blurred towards 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.459
 little touches then I will take the shade 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.980
 black and with my brush to blur I'll 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.549
 try to blur that dark blue 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.370
 up and we're going to do it by taking 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.739
 from the black shadow of little by little to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.829
 that more than anything this color is not very 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.710
 marked but only remain as one 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.139
 low shadow and good let's blur 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.360
 very 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.050
 in that color and already once what 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.509
 we have blurred we are going to retouch the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.639
 blue tone that I already had because as 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.219
 that we are blurring up is going 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.590
 losing the tonality and I'll go 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.020
 going up now a little bit up 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.629
 then I will continue to blur that 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.110
 shadow so that the fold is not noticeable 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:51.479
 then I'm going to take this white shadow and 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.139
 I'm going to apply it on the brow bone 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.069
 to illuminate this part 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.069
 ah 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.470
 we will take a brush in the form of a pencil and 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.040
 I'm going to take the same gray shadow 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.430
 and with it I'm going to delineate the area 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.920
 down my eyelid 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.650
 and we're going to apply it only to the 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.540
 half and also the tear with that 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.450
 let's light up after the other part 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.450
 I'm going to put the blue tone like I'm going to 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.600
 pull in half we only retouch 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.510
 of the gray tone I will outline in tone 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.330
 dark what is the water line with 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.600
 this visu pencil also in the part 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.360
 from above I will delineate with the 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.030
 and gel liner and once 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.820
 let's have our eyes outlined we're going to 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.340
 perform the tabs let's get 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.320
 false eyelashes and good for this 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.740
 makeup I love to eyelashes 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.460
 If you put a lipstick on 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.470
 pink tone or not this is up to decision of 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.510
 what you like may even be 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.360
 a red and well this is the result 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.300
