325<00:04:25.340> for<00:04:26.150> three<00:04:26.480> or<00:04:26.690> four<00:04:26.720> reps<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.470> think<00:04:27.680> it's

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
325 for three or four reps I think it's

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.530 
325 for three or four reps I think it's
three<00:04:28.130> reps<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:28.580> that's<00:04:29.120> pretty<00:04:29.240> proud<00:04:29.480> of

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
three reps but that's pretty proud of

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.600 
three reps but that's pretty proud of
myself<00:04:29.660> there<00:04:30.140> anyway<00:04:31.070> it's<00:04:31.220> also<00:04:31.340> getting

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
myself there anyway it's also getting

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.820 
myself there anyway it's also getting
through<00:04:31.850> 59<00:04:32.390> too<00:04:32.690> upset<00:04:33.350> about<00:04:33.500> that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
through 59 too upset about that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.500 
through 59 too upset about that
considering<00:04:34.460> bench-pressing<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.210> my<00:04:35.330> weak

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
considering bench-pressing is my weak

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.330 
considering bench-pressing is my weak
point<00:04:35.750> so<00:04:36.500> that's<00:04:36.740> why<00:04:36.950> I'm<00:04:37.040> doing<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
point so that's why I'm doing the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.740 
point so that's why I'm doing the
strength<00:04:37.640> pyramid<00:04:38.120> style<00:04:38.270> training<00:04:38.510> for

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
strength pyramid style training for

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.480 
strength pyramid style training for
bench<00:04:38.930> pressing<00:04:39.320> lately<00:04:39.590> everything<00:04:40.190> else

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
bench pressing lately everything else

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.250 
bench pressing lately everything else
following<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.210> is<00:04:41.390> all<00:04:41.570> muscle<00:04:41.780> hypertrophy

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
following that is all muscle hypertrophy

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.440 
following that is all muscle hypertrophy
so<00:04:42.680> we're<00:04:43.220> using<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.580> PEC<00:04:43.850> deck<00:04:43.880> which<00:04:44.300> was

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
so we're using the PEC deck which was

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.670 
so we're using the PEC deck which was
Nick's<00:04:44.660> idea<00:04:44.780> one<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.230> his<00:04:45.320> favorite

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
Nick's idea one of his favorite

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.910 
Nick's idea one of his favorite
movements<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.420> again<00:04:47.420> high<00:04:48.080> reps<00:04:48.410> about<00:04:48.680> 10

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
movements and again high reps about 10

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.310 
movements and again high reps about 10
to<00:04:49.010> 12<00:04:49.220> reps<00:04:49.460> per<00:04:49.550> set<00:04:49.640> hair<00:04:50.090> real<00:04:50.750> slow<00:04:51.140> and

the right top of the rep this is an

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.820 
the right top of the rep this is an
excellent<00:04:56.570> movement<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:57.320> building<00:04:57.680> up<00:04:57.740> the

what<00:05:01.400> did<00:05:01.490> we<00:05:01.520> do<00:05:01.700> four<00:05:02.060> or<00:05:02.150> five<00:05:02.270> sets<00:05:02.540> of<00:05:02.630> that

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
what did we do four or five sets of that

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.380 
what did we do four or five sets of that
we<00:05:03.320> went<00:05:03.560> into<00:05:03.710> incline<00:05:04.340> dumbbell<00:05:04.940> bench<00:05:05.120> Inge

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
we went into incline dumbbell bench Inge

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.390 
we went into incline dumbbell bench Inge
now<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.170> gym<00:05:06.440> only<00:05:06.680> has<00:05:06.830> 100<00:05:07.040> pound

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
now this gym only has 100 pound

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.470 
now this gym only has 100 pound
dumbbells<00:05:07.760> they<00:05:07.940> used<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.150> have<00:05:08.240> heavier

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
dumbbells they used to have heavier

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.750 
dumbbells they used to have heavier
dumbbells<00:05:08.930> but<00:05:09.320> they<00:05:09.560> no<00:05:09.680> longer<00:05:09.830> do<00:05:10.130> 100

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
dumbbells but they no longer do 100

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.490 
dumbbells but they no longer do 100
pounds<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.090> when<00:05:11.210> they<00:05:11.270> cut<00:05:11.419> them<00:05:11.540> off<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:12.260> we

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
pounds is when they cut them off so we

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.570 
pounds is when they cut them off so we
couldn't<00:05:12.710> do<00:05:12.890> dumbbell<00:05:13.130> work<00:05:13.400> in<00:05:13.520> the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
couldn't do dumbbell work in the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.060 
couldn't do dumbbell work in the
beginning<00:05:13.730> because<00:05:14.330> each<00:05:15.230> one<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.530> us<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.860> do

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
beginning because each one of us can do

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.150 
beginning because each one of us can do
120<00:05:16.760> s<00:05:16.820> 4<00:05:16.940> sets<00:05:17.180> fresh<00:05:17.960> so<00:05:18.680> what<00:05:18.800> we<00:05:18.860> did<00:05:18.980> is<00:05:19.040> we

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
120 s 4 sets fresh so what we did is we

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.730 
120 s 4 sets fresh so what we did is we
pre<00:05:19.430> exhausted<00:05:19.940> our<00:05:20.030> chest<00:05:20.300> first<00:05:20.620> then<00:05:21.620> we

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
pre exhausted our chest first then we

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.860 
pre exhausted our chest first then we
moved<00:05:21.919> into<00:05:22.070> inclined<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.390> little<00:05:23.690> bit<00:05:23.840> of

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
moved into inclined so a little bit of

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.870 
moved into inclined so a little bit of
weight<00:05:24.050> would<00:05:24.230> go<00:05:24.320> a<00:05:24.350> much<00:05:24.590> longer<00:05:25.070> way<00:05:25.460> and

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
weight would go a much longer way and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.470 
weight would go a much longer way and
I'm<00:05:26.330> showing<00:05:26.480> you<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.810> last<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:28.490> think<00:05:29.360> we

either way this is the last set of how
are<00:05:36.740> many<00:05:36.890> sets<00:05:37.130> we<00:05:37.250> did<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.210> saw<00:05:38.510> me

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
set hypertrophy style training we did

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.450 
set hypertrophy style training we did
about<00:06:02.210> five<00:06:02.510> sets<00:06:02.930> of<00:06:03.140> this<00:06:03.620> awesome<00:06:04.160> Hammer

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
about five sets of this awesome Hammer

about five sets of this awesome Hammer
Strength<00:06:04.729> flat<00:06:05.270> bench<00:06:05.540> it's<00:06:06.200> on<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.380> very<00:06:06.680> very

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
Strength flat bench it's on a very very

Strength flat bench it's on a very very
very<00:06:07.070> slight<00:06:07.790> incline<00:06:08.270> I<00:06:08.510> believe<00:06:08.900> there's

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
very slight incline I believe there's

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.260 
very slight incline I believe there's
like<00:06:09.200> a<00:06:09.260> 25<00:06:09.650> pound<00:06:09.800> plate<00:06:10.070> underneath<00:06:10.340> it<00:06:10.610> but

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
like a 25 pound plate underneath it but

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.490 
like a 25 pound plate underneath it but
it's<00:06:11.390> mostly<00:06:11.630> flat<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:11.930> as<00:06:12.110> you<00:06:12.200> can<00:06:12.350> see<00:06:12.380> I

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
it's mostly flat and as you can see I

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.290 
it's mostly flat and as you can see I
actually<00:06:12.650> have<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.950> big<00:06:13.130> bag<00:06:13.310> grips<00:06:13.729> even

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
actually have the big bag grips even

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.710 
actually have the big bag grips even
though<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:15.080> handles<00:06:15.620> are<00:06:15.860> rubber<00:06:16.340> coated<00:06:16.880> so

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
though the handles are rubber coated so

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.029 
though the handles are rubber coated so
you're<00:06:17.870> not<00:06:17.930> really<00:06:18.140> slipping<00:06:18.620> around<00:06:18.710> too

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
you're not really slipping around too

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.020 
you're not really slipping around too
much<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:19.400> grips<00:06:19.640> do

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
much the grips do

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.640 
much the grips do

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
little bit better there's that absolute

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.180 
little bit better there's that absolute
grip<00:06:23.480> so<00:06:23.690> you<00:06:23.750> can<00:06:23.930> just<00:06:23.960> push<00:06:24.500> harder<00:06:25.010> and

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
grip so you can just push harder and
