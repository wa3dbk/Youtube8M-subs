Rises<00:00:36.570> during<00:00:36.930> baking<00:00:37.260> it'll<00:00:38.190> tend<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> go

Rises during baking it'll tend to go

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.130 
Rises during baking it'll tend to go
over<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> edges<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> doesn't<00:00:40.020> have

over the edges if it doesn't have

over the edges if it doesn't have
something<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.710> hold<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
commercial bakery we actually use

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
commercial bakery we actually use
something<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.579> looks<00:00:44.789> very<00:00:45.000> much<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
something that looks very much like a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
something that looks very much like a
cookie<00:00:45.809> sheet<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.230> has<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.620> small<00:00:46.800> edge

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
cookie sheet it has a very small edge

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.660 
cookie sheet it has a very small edge
but<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.149> there's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.710> fiber<00:00:49.710> glass<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.489> I'm

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
but then there's a fiber glass or I'm

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
but then there's a fiber glass or I'm
not<00:00:50.820> sure<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> material<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
not sure what kind of material but it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
not sure what kind of material but it's
kind<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> plasticy<00:00:53.280> material<00:00:55.969> frame<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
kind of a plasticy material frame that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.819 
kind of a plasticy material frame that
we<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.539> down<00:00:57.719> inside<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.199> cookie<00:00:58.620> sheet

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
we put down inside that cookie sheet

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.310 
we put down inside that cookie sheet
which<00:00:59.039> gives<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> wall<00:01:00.180> something<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
which gives it a wall something for the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.740 
which gives it a wall something for the
cinnamon<00:01:02.160> roll<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> lean<00:01:02.820> against<00:01:03.180> you'll

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
can put some butter in the bottom a lot
of<00:01:09.540> times<00:01:09.750> I'll<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.860> spray<00:01:11.159> put<00:01:11.400> some

in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> bottom<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.930> they're

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
in the bottom so then when they're

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
in the bottom so then when they're
cooked<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.560> you've<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> goo

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
cooked if you've really got a lot of goo

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.300 
cooked if you've really got a lot of goo
there<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.689> we'll<00:01:22.259> start<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.159> may

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
there but we'll start with this we may

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
there but we'll start with this we may
need<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.450> more<00:01:24.659> pan

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
need to actually use one more pan

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.670 
need to actually use one more pan
because<00:01:26.430> my<00:01:26.900> cinnamon<00:01:27.900> roll<00:01:28.049> log<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.409> quite

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
because my cinnamon roll log is quite

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
because my cinnamon roll log is quite
large<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.430> might<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.659> too<00:01:30.840> many

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
large so we might actually have too many

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230 
large so we might actually have too many
cinnamon<00:01:31.409> rolls<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.970> next

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
cinnamon rolls for this one the next

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.340 
cinnamon rolls for this one the next
thing<00:01:33.390> we're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
thing we're going to want to do is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.520 
thing we're going to want to do is
actually<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.009> cut<00:01:35.659> our<00:01:36.659> cinnamon<00:01:37.079> rolls<00:01:37.110> now

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
actually to cut our cinnamon rolls now

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.399 
actually to cut our cinnamon rolls now
this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.450> I'm<00:01:39.450> gonna<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.720> sure<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.140> call

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this is I'm gonna be sure what they call

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
this is I'm gonna be sure what they call
this<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> bake<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.280> used<00:01:41.549> them

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
this in the bake we have used them

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.359 
this in the bake we have used them
forever<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:43.439> doesn't<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> real<00:01:44.100> sharp

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
forever but it doesn't have a real sharp

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.880 
forever but it doesn't have a real sharp
edge<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.170> use<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
edge on it and so we use this to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
edge on it and so we use this to
actually<00:01:47.369> cut<00:01:47.579> dough<00:01:47.820> without<00:01:48.180> cutting<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
actually cut dough without cutting a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
actually cut dough without cutting a
counter<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> knife<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.100> then

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
counter you can use a knife but then

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.940 
counter you can use a knife but then
you'd<00:01:50.399> want<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> use<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.970> chopping<00:01:51.720> block<00:01:51.950> and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you'd want to use a chopping block and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429 
you'd want to use a chopping block and
then<00:01:53.850> determine<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:54.570> long<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
then determine how long you want to be I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
then determine how long you want to be I
usually<00:01:55.920> make<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.430> an<00:01:56.549> inch<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
usually make them about an inch and a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.050 
usually make them about an inch and a
half<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.329> two<00:01:57.509> inches<00:01:57.540> long<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.829> I've<00:01:59.820> seen

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
half to two inches long now I've seen

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.850 
half to two inches long now I've seen
people<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.840> along<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.710> them

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
people go along like this and get them

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.620 
people go along like this and get them
all<00:02:02.040> different<00:02:02.880> heights<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.360> it's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
all different heights because it's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.569 
all different heights because it's
really<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> hard<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.380> gauge<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:05.369> take

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
really kind of hard to gauge you take

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.719 
really kind of hard to gauge you take
your<00:02:05.729> first<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.210> set<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.229> next<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.729> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
your first one set it next to it and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.420 
your first one set it next to it and
then<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.619> gauge<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.220> then

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
then just use that as the gauge and then

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880 
then just use that as the gauge and then
you<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:13.200> more

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you have some a little more

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.410 
you have some a little more
in<00:02:14.460> uniform<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.650> making<00:02:16.860> sure<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:18.240> all<00:02:18.390> of

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
in uniform as to making sure that all of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.840 
in uniform as to making sure that all of
the<00:02:18.750> cinnamon<00:02:19.170> rolls<00:02:19.410> are<00:02:19.770> more<00:02:20.100> or<00:02:20.250> less<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the cinnamon rolls are more or less the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.449 
the cinnamon rolls are more or less the
same<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:25.650> course<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> two<00:02:26.160> end<00:02:26.370> ones

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
same and of course the two end ones

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.730 
same and of course the two end ones
usually<00:02:26.730> are<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.270> most<00:02:27.480> different<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.560> we've

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
usually are the most different so we've

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.770 
usually are the most different so we've
got<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.310> two<00:02:29.340> three<00:02:29.580> four<00:02:29.790> five<00:02:30.120> six<00:02:30.390> seven

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
got one two three four five six seven

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.940 
got one two three four five six seven
eight<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.140> they'll<00:02:31.290> probably<00:02:31.380> all<00:02:31.590> fit<00:02:31.830> in

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
eight so they'll probably all fit in

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.490 
eight so they'll probably all fit in
this<00:02:32.070> pan<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.610> we'll<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.209> take<00:02:33.360> our<00:02:33.540> pan<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
this pan so we'll just take our pan and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.290 
this pan so we'll just take our pan and
you<00:02:37.500> want<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.580> little<00:02:38.610> bit<00:02:39.209> of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you want to have just a little bit of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.530 
you want to have just a little bit of
room<00:02:40.670> between<00:02:41.670> each<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.330> want<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
room between each you don't want to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.979 
room between each you don't want to
stick<00:02:42.720> them<00:02:42.930> too<00:02:43.260> close<00:02:43.500> together<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.989> we're

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
stick them too close together so we're

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.500 
stick them too close together so we're
going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> do<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> row<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.709> four<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.510> they've

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
going to do a row of four and they've

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.960 
going to do a row of four and they've
got<00:02:48.690> some<00:02:48.930> room<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.830> see<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.370> little

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
got some room if you can see a little

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.090 
got some room if you can see a little
space<00:02:51.300> between<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.170> we're<00:02:52.739> going<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.920> do

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
space between and we're going to do

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.960 
space between and we're going to do
another<00:02:53.519> row<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.150> four<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.519> will<00:02:56.730> will

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
another row of four so this will will

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.350 
another row of four so this will will
only<00:02:57.150> need<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.510> pan<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.890> will<00:02:59.360> fill

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
only need the one pan and this will fill

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.509 
only need the one pan and this will fill
up<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.750> come<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:01.800> close<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.310> top

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
up and come up probably close to the top

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.810 
up and come up probably close to the top
if<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.910> little<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.360> over<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.650> they<00:03:05.550> look<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
if not a little bit over so they look a

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.270 
if not a little bit over so they look a
little<00:03:05.910> piece<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.269> dough<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.660> eat<00:03:06.750> that

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
little piece of dough we can eat that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.460 
little piece of dough we can eat that
raw<00:03:08.280> now<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.390> we've<00:03:09.510> done<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.780> all<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.350> have

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
raw now that we've done that all we have

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.650 
raw now that we've done that all we have
to<00:03:10.590> do<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.860> put<00:03:11.040> them<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> oven<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:12.360> 25

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
to do is put them in the oven for 25

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.610 
to do is put them in the oven for 25
minutes<00:03:13.220> check<00:03:14.220> partway<00:03:14.610> through<00:03:15.620> because

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
minutes check partway through because

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
minutes check partway through because
sometimes<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:17.250> they<00:03:17.519> get<00:03:17.670> too<00:03:17.850> tight<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.299> here

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
sometimes if they get too tight in here

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.080 
sometimes if they get too tight in here
the<00:03:19.049> middle<00:03:19.440> spiral<00:03:20.070> will<00:03:20.280> poke<00:03:20.489> up<00:03:20.700> real<00:03:20.910> high

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the middle spiral will poke up real high

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.310 
the middle spiral will poke up real high
and<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.329> can<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.630> take<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.780> special<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
and you can just take a special and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.710 
and you can just take a special and
shove<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.500> back<00:03:22.739> where<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:22.950> belongs<00:03:23.600> but<00:03:24.600> at

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
shove it back where it belongs but at

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.640 
shove it back where it belongs but at
this<00:03:24.840> point<00:03:25.049> we<00:03:25.680> are<00:03:25.709> now<00:03:25.950> ready<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.430> bake
