little mild indications that something
is<00:06:56.050> slightly<00:06:56.289> different<00:06:56.740> but<00:06:57.219> it's<00:06:57.340> not

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
is slightly different but it's not

they<00:07:03.129> will<00:07:03.310> look<00:07:03.460> at<00:07:03.639> how<00:07:03.819> this<00:07:04.120> gene<00:07:04.479> fragment

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
they will look at how this gene fragment

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.429 
they will look at how this gene fragment
and<00:07:05.349> 15<00:07:06.129> other<00:07:06.400> ones<00:07:06.840> interact<00:07:07.840> with<00:07:08.110> another

will<00:07:20.319> get<00:07:20.529> people<00:07:20.889> interested<00:07:21.189> in<00:07:21.580> DNA<00:07:22.229> it

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:23.229 
will get people interested in DNA it

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.320 
will get people interested in DNA it
definitely<00:07:23.620> shows<00:07:23.949> the<00:07:24.340> variability<00:07:24.819> that<00:07:25.060> we

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
definitely shows the variability that we

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.779 
definitely shows the variability that we
have<00:07:25.509> within<00:07:25.930> our<00:07:26.139> genes<00:07:26.439> and<00:07:26.639> it's<00:07:27.639> a<00:07:27.759> very

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:27.789 
have within our genes and it's a very

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:36.240 
have within our genes and it's a very
elegant<00:07:28.120> way<00:07:28.479> of<00:07:28.719> expressing<00:07:29.199> that<00:07:35.250> that's

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
elegant way of expressing that that's

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.680 
elegant way of expressing that that's
all<00:07:36.430> for<00:07:36.610> now<00:07:36.639> but<00:07:36.969> you'll<00:07:37.089> find<00:07:37.330> loads<00:07:37.509> more
