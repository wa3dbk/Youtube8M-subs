unique is the way that the gamepad is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.870 
unique is the way that the gamepad is
integrated<00:00:36.140> into<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.890> game<00:00:37.040> itself<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:37.550> for

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
into the entire game play experience I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.270 
into the entire game play experience I
thought<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:14.930> was<00:01:15.020> uh<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.500> was<00:01:15.560> neat<00:01:15.830> how<00:01:16.010> you've

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
thought it was uh it was neat how you've

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.390 
thought it was uh it was neat how you've
got<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:16.580> stuff<00:01:16.790> going<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:17.450> uh<00:01:17.960> it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
got this stuff going on and it's uh it's

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.260 
got this stuff going on and it's uh it's
definitely<00:01:19.400> what<00:01:19.549> I'd<00:01:19.640> call<00:01:19.850> bells<00:01:20.119> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
definitely what I'd call bells and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.940 
definitely what I'd call bells and
whistles<00:01:20.630> but<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.409> not<00:01:21.590> something<00:01:21.920> that

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
whistles but it's not something that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.649 
whistles but it's not something that
takes<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.790> out<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.030> game<00:01:23.180> if<00:01:23.299> anything<00:01:23.570> it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
takes you out of the game if anything it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.630 
takes you out of the game if anything it
draws<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.290> further<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.830> everything's<00:01:25.310> in

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
in real time right right that's really

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.710 
in real time right right that's really
cool<00:01:28.100> part<00:01:28.250> about<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.490> actually<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:29.330> you're

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
cool part about it actually so if you're

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
attacked by zombies that are sort of

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.760 
attacked by zombies that are sort of
coming<00:01:44.210> up<00:01:44.299> all<00:01:44.420> around<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.840> obviously<00:01:45.259> so

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
it's really cool way that it's been

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.359 
it's really cool way that it's been
integrated<00:01:47.780> into<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.110> game<00:01:48.619> as<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.009> say<00:01:49.159> like

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
integrated into the game as you say like

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.889 
integrated into the game as you say like
the<00:01:49.430> bells<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:49.880> whistles<00:01:49.970> don't<00:01:50.390> distract

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
the bells and whistles don't distract

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.389 
the bells and whistles don't distract
you<00:01:51.170> from<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.409> main<00:01:51.649> game<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.220> really

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
you from the main game and it really

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.270 
you from the main game and it really
makes<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.820> more<00:01:53.360> immersive<00:01:53.750> yeah<00:01:54.280> actually

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
makes it more immersive yeah actually

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.980 
makes it more immersive yeah actually
adds<00:01:55.579> a<00:01:55.670> sense<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:55.939> urgency<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.750> yeah

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
adds a sense of urgency to it yeah

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.450 
adds a sense of urgency to it yeah
there's<00:01:57.200> another<00:01:57.350> thing<00:01:57.649> that's<00:01:57.890> sort<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.340> a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
there's another thing that's sort of a

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.910 
there's another thing that's sort of a
weird<00:01:58.909> intensity<00:01:59.869> is<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.200> there's<00:02:00.530> there's

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
weird intensity is is there's there's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520 
weird intensity is is there's there's
permadeath<00:02:01.250> yeah<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:02.689> is<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> really<00:02:03.229> cool

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
permadeath yeah this is a really cool

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.170 
permadeath yeah this is a really cool
way<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:04.219> that<00:02:04.369> they've<00:02:04.520> treated<00:02:05.000> this

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
way I think that they've treated this

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.350 
way I think that they've treated this
sort<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.540> game<00:02:05.600> over<00:02:06.259> type<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:07.670> experience

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
sort of game over type of experience

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.999 
sort of game over type of experience
that<00:02:08.390> we<00:02:08.540> see<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:08.720> lots<00:02:09.019> of<00:02:09.110> games<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:09.619> instead

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
that we see in lots of games so instead

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.190 
that we see in lots of games so instead
of<00:02:10.160> just<00:02:10.369> dying<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:11.660> your<00:02:11.870> character

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
of just dying and then your character

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.510 
of just dying and then your character
just<00:02:12.379> comes<00:02:12.530> back<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.800> life<00:02:12.830> obviously<00:02:13.459> you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
just comes back to life obviously you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.960 
just comes back to life obviously you
continue<00:02:13.970> if<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.629> die<00:02:15.140> as

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
continue if you die as

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.090 
continue if you die as
particular<00:02:16.450> character<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.350> will<00:02:17.470> never<00:02:17.800> ever

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
particular character you will never ever

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.980 
particular character you will never ever
play<00:02:18.580> at<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.910> character<00:02:19.330> again<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.810> fact

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
play at that character again in fact

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.740 
play at that character again in fact
that<00:02:20.170> character<00:02:20.890> becomes<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.670> zombie<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.600> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
that character becomes a zombie that you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.050 
that character becomes a zombie that you
have<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.170> go<00:02:23.350> find<00:02:23.710> as<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.070> different<00:02:24.700> survivor

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
have to go find as a different survivor

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.710

really<00:02:28.810> cool<00:02:29.020> because<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.290> game<00:02:29.410> actually

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
really cool because the game actually

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.320 
really cool because the game actually
tracked<00:02:30.010> how<00:02:30.190> long<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.640> survive<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.300> a

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
tracked how long you survive is a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.840 
tracked how long you survive is a
particular<00:02:31.810> character<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.070> start<00:02:33.520> as<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
particular character so you start as a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.510 
particular character so you start as a
character<00:02:34.180> named<00:02:34.390> Owen<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.980> dying<00:02:36.250> as
