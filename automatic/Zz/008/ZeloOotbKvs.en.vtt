of how the feature works and how to set

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.270 
of how the feature works and how to set
it<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.570> first<00:00:33.809> time<00:00:35.899> to<00:00:36.899> set<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> up<00:00:37.290> we

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it up for the first time to set it up we

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.270 
it up for the first time to set it up we
need<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.670> into<00:00:38.790> settings<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.129> locate<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
need to go into settings and locate the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
need to go into settings and locate the
icon<00:00:41.640> called<00:00:42.110> finger<00:00:43.110> scanner<00:00:45.379> currently

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
icon called finger scanner currently

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
icon called finger scanner currently
there<00:00:46.649> are<00:00:46.680> no<00:00:46.920> fingerprints<00:00:47.430> registered<00:00:48.000> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
there are no fingerprints registered on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.250 
there are no fingerprints registered on
this<00:00:48.450> device<00:00:49.789> let's<00:00:50.789> go<00:00:51.000> ahead<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.420> set<00:00:52.050> one

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
this device let's go ahead and set one

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
this device let's go ahead and set one
up<00:00:56.870> now<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> s5<00:00:58.440> fingerprint<00:00:59.039> scanner<00:00:59.480> works

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
up now the s5 fingerprint scanner works

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.490 
up now the s5 fingerprint scanner works
a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.780> differently<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:02.600> use<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.809> we

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
a little differently and to use it we

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.590 
a little differently and to use it we
need<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.920> swipe<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.460> finger<00:01:06.000> across

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:28.840 

slow<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.530> steady<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.290> go

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.140 

this<00:01:29.510> process<00:01:29.930> needs<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.740> be<00:01:30.920> repeated<00:01:31.220> eight

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
this process needs to be repeated eight

00:01:32.150 --> 00:02:28.740 
this process needs to be repeated eight
times<00:01:36.610> but<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:38.119> is<00:01:38.240> only<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.720> one-time<00:01:39.350> setup

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.720 

there<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.810> go<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.890> fingerprint<00:02:31.370> has<00:02:31.550> been

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there you go the fingerprint has been

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.710 
there you go the fingerprint has been
registered<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:33.560> need<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.920> enter<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.720> backup

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
registered and I need to enter a backup

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:58.690 
registered and I need to enter a backup
password

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.390 

the<00:02:59.700> screen<00:03:00.060> unlock<00:03:00.510> settings<00:03:01.070> need<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.280> be

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the screen unlock settings need to be

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.130 
the screen unlock settings need to be
set<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:04.730> fingerprint<00:03:08.390> it's<00:03:09.390> set<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.630> now<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
set to fingerprint it's set up now and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:23.570 
set to fingerprint it's set up now and
let's<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:10.680> hard<00:03:11.490> works

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.920 

there<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.330> go<00:03:25.310> works<00:03:26.310> quite<00:03:26.550> well<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:27.630> device

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
there you go works quite well the device

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.980 
there you go works quite well the device
has<00:03:28.140> been<00:03:28.530> unlocked<00:03:29.100> using<00:03:29.730> my<00:03:30.090> fingerprint

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.290 

so<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.170> was<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.530> brief<00:03:34.890> demo<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
so that was a brief demo of the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.480 
so that was a brief demo of the
fingerprint<00:03:36.780> sensor<00:03:37.140> functionality<00:03:37.770> on<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
fingerprint sensor functionality on the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.710 
fingerprint sensor functionality on the
Samsung<00:03:38.910> Galaxy<00:03:38.940> s5<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.250> deeper<00:03:41.720> signing

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
Samsung Galaxy s5 this is deeper signing

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.810 
Samsung Galaxy s5 this is deeper signing
