00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 and we passed all this and good 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.290
 in all of vic trees 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.820
 the point folder 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.000
 and now the steps because I already have it 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.010
 and good here is what this mode does 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.880
 it would be this walk in open but 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.880
 Ok here 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 no I do not think like stilettos good 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.700
 I am creating 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.620
 is creating I'm going to move from scope to 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 video in which I put the different 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.900
 ways to make trees and good 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.510
 and good and continue friends 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.709
 for those who do not know where to tighten 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
 I'm not recording the course 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.920
 forgot to activate dry from the vera here the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.920
 intended 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.660
 I already did all the different ways if 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.790
 they want to see the different ways that 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.790
 there is to create them only that they put here 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.209
 link that I left in the description and 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.189
 good in the shapes of the circle is this 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.989
 where the shoot is put I do not remember 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.879
 how is it called in English 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.879
 well here is there one that I created 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.530
 because she 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.489
 I already lacked about three or 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.489
 four times she covets 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.180
 we put this with a ground bone and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 we explore 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.980
 j 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.010
 if it would be easier to create your house in 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.250
 the tree and then they just add the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.200
 floor 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.200
 furniture and it's also a little big 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.120
 and this one trunk as you can see 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.920
 this and it's just like a raised toco with 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.459
 branches 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.459
 i 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 and it is also big 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.250
 for this mode without as I already spoke 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.250
 had said that if it's like easier 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.820
 to create their faces in the tree already what 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.460
 only thing that we have to do here is 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:30.140
 montaigne with the floor and our way 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.140
 that we are not also 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.850
 you see how you can see this are 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.830
 different types of trees of 8 with the 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.840
 same shoot with the same type d 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.080
 Wood to tell us us 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.979
 changes and you know what 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.979
 we go down 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.690
 and how can you see this 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.470
 this is like a pyramid type or 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:17.230
 triangle 16 and I like it is the favorite 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.300
 and well that would be the mod 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.569
 vick 3 I hope you liked it 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.659
 I hope that the mod has worked 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:30.699
 and good is I hope you do well not
