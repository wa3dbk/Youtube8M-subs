 they know nick fury is a character 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 complex that is not afraid to pull the trigger 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.220
 When the world is in danger it is because 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.580

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.580
 Things you should know about nick fry 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.580
 let's start 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.040
 but first thing first nick fury the 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.350
 original is a white character the 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.360
 version of samuel jackson in the cinema is 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.610
 one inspired by the alternate universe of 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.130
 last we will mainly talk about the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.930
 first nick fury and then we will go 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.489
 talking about its different versions and 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.440
 if you may wonder why in the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.970
 cover of the video we have the nick fury 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.460
 lack of love and the track song and it's because 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.620
 sincerely today is the one that 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.650
 He knows people but it's time to go to 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 origin creation and publication this 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.559
 character 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.750
 nicknamed the anti james bond made his debut 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.080
 in the series the saiyans yuri and his 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.540
 holding commandos in 1963 created by jack 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.370
 kirby and stan lee are rumored to be 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.350
 comic was the product of a bet where 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.180
 Stanley told Martin Goodman his 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.280
 editor that even a bad series could 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.770
 sell if it was made by him and jack 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.540
 Kirby and if he apparently won the bet 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.160
 because the character was acquiring 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.229
 relevance to the point that between 1968 and 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.110

 to become a sergeant without 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.799
 However, not everything would work well since

 best friend red one inper harbor

 within field house in commands being 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.240
 already a sergeant a fiori 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.340
 he was entrusted with the leadership of a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.170
 highly trained squadron known 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.149

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.360
 as red skull and baron cm along 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.519
 of these missions nick could fight 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 shoulder to shoulder with characters like the 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.170
 captain america and logan the serum 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.360
 infinity yuri was wounded in repeated 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.610
 occasions during the first and second 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.799
 world war in the first a grenade 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.840
 hit him near him injuring his eye 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.910
 left but it would be on a mission in 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.739
 france where a landmine exploded 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.020
 and left him extremely injured 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.330
 the doctor bert colts tamberg found him 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.490
 and I swear not before using it in their 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.800
 experiments to stop the process of 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.600
 human aging injected him a 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640
 kind of serum called serum 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.960
 infinite which was actually a 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.120
 Improved version of the serum 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.070
 supersoldier but this serum possessed a 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.290
 disadvantage and that is that it required a 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.150
 annual dose at the beginning nicolás not what 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.980
 I knew why he grew old 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.300
 accelerated way doctor pierre with 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.580
 the blackmail for a while 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.920
 asking for money and other things to 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
 give him his annual dose Dr. Berger does not 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.920
 I expected that the serum would react 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.080
 slowly in the body of nyc 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.060
 being included in your DNA making the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.850
 annual dose at a certain point outside 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.620
 unnecessary its stage itself after 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.510
 having finished the fierce war started to 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.820
 work for the government of the us 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.830
 first for the cia after several 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.170
 missions would be assigned to the project 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.480
 governmental known as 7a and 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.550
 He led the fight against haidar and others 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.500
 criminal organizations for years 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.470
 a secret war was carried out 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.660
 against terrorism nicolás skills 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.070
 does not possess superhuman powers this does not 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 means that he is not a man 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.450
 extremely dangerous is highly 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.520
 trained in different martial arts 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.230
 and styles 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.450
 and he has been perfecting his technique 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.580
 becoming the perfect companion of 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.590
 captain america training when 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.200
 they talk about firearms their control is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.000
 extreme has an enviable aim to the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.070
 be one of the best spies in the world 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.870
 its strategic control is supreme 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.270
 Carrying out complex plans for 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.730
 meet your goals although sometimes your 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.560
 different questionable methods 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.870
 versions of nick fury the look of the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.060
 Ultimate version of the character is much 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.190
 more similar to the appearance of samuel 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.750
 jackson and is that even when samuel does not 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.640
 I was aware of the existence of a 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.890
 character similar to him the cartoonist of 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.660
 the series Bryan Weech has admitted having 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.970
 based his illustrations on the famous 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.500
 actor in fact in a comic is mentioned to 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.540
 way of joking that thought 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.520
 film adaptations where the captain 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.440
 america would be played by brad pitt 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.140
 in nick fury by samuel jackson 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.850
 apparently this turned out to be true already 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.100
 that in 2008 it would make its first appearance 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.860
 in ironman 1 to present him the 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.430
 project of the stunned avengers 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.430
 lesson 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.670
 but inside the comics to attract 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.860
 more sales within the earth 616 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.900
 marvel created a character very similar to 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.270
 last which is the son of nick fury 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.730
 with an African-American spy to protect 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.470
 the child against his enemies yuri hides 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.660
 the identity of his family and the son 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.580
 takes the name of marcus johnson marcus 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.440
 eventually it would become a 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.750
 shield agent adopting the name of 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.430
 nick fury yunia if there are more versions of 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.280
 nick fury but those are the most 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.190
 currently known now let's go with 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.740
 some curiosities these people had a 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.570
 solo movie in 1998 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.190
 starring David Hasselhoff 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.560
 called nick fury 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.720
 hentoff shield was a film that did not like 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.660
 very successful due to its doubtful 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.760
 Bone quality was pretty bad in the 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.890
 history of origin so you discover that 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.260
 nick fury has aged since being 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.240
 infinite has failed so it has a 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.590
 bunch of clones of him at the end of this 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.050
 story after the death of the watchman 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.030
 wat or other watchers would grant him 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.950
 cosmic powers to nick fury with the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.080
 intention that he would become the 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.090
 next vigilante called and still without 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.070

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.560
 yes 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.600
 to be able to intervene, taking up the subject of 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.170
 the clones if he is in charge of creating 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.180
 online elements models and models 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.010
 facts in order to supplant the place 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.840
 of a living person in order to 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.700
 accomplish very risky missions or 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.370
 impersonate someone of great importance 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.500
