mixing it up so this is TDM first 241

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.309 
mixing it up so this is TDM first 241
because<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.629> obviously<00:02:43.659> it's<00:02:44.290> not

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
because you know obviously it's not

because you know obviously it's not
first<00:02:44.620> 275<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.579> Call<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:45.970> Duty<00:02:46.299> would<00:02:46.450> be<00:02:46.569> in

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
first 275 like Call of Duty would be in

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.240 
first 275 like Call of Duty would be in
a<00:02:46.750> regular<00:02:47.079> standard<00:02:47.319> TV<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.799> just<00:02:47.980> because

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
a regular standard TV I'm just because

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.250 
a regular standard TV I'm just because
Hills<00:02:48.940> come<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.390> much<00:02:49.540> harder<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.079> this<00:02:50.170> game

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
Hills come so much harder in this game

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.960 
Hills come so much harder in this game
you<00:02:50.650> really<00:02:50.859> have<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.099> fight<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.400> every<00:02:51.609> kill

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
you really have to fight for every kill

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.339 
you really have to fight for every kill
just<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.209> everybody<00:02:52.750> has<00:02:52.870> an<00:02:53.049> over

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
just because everybody has an over

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.470 
just because everybody has an over
shield<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.950> everybody<00:02:54.639> has<00:02:54.790> health<00:02:55.090> beneath

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
shield and everybody has health beneath

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.360 
shield and everybody has health beneath
that<00:02:55.629> over<00:02:55.930> shield<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.379> so<00:02:56.500> every<00:02:56.920> kill<00:02:57.159> is

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
that over shield and so every kill is

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.530 
that over shield and so every kill is
something<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.299> earn<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.840> uh<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.940> with

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
something that you earn and uh it's with

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.690 
something that you earn and uh it's with

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
that being said I only go nine and three

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.309 
that being said I only go nine and three
in<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:03.879> gameplay<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:04.659> you'll<00:03:04.989> see<00:03:05.170> that

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
in this gameplay but you'll see that

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.289
