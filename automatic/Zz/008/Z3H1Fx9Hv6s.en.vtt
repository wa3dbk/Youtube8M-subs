adhesive backing I wasn't sure whether

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.940 
adhesive backing I wasn't sure whether
they<00:01:24.820> would<00:01:24.940> hold<00:01:25.090> long-term<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.440> just<00:01:26.680> hots

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
they would hold long-term so I just hots

board<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.590> back<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.040> would<00:01:33.190> show<00:01:33.340> through

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
board the back of it would show through

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.440 
board the back of it would show through
that<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.850> window<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.600> vestibule<00:01:35.040> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that little window in the vestibule so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.090 
that little window in the vestibule so
maybe<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:38.110> what<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.230> did<00:01:38.350> was<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:38.650> took<00:01:38.980> a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
maybe so what I did was just took a

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.860 
maybe so what I did was just took a
sharpie<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.520> color<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.970> black<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.660> if<00:01:40.750> it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
sharpie and color to black so that if it

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.960 
sharpie and color to black so that if it
did<00:01:41.020> show<00:01:41.230> through<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.710> end<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:42.580> wouldn't<00:01:42.910> be

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
did show through the end it wouldn't be

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.540 
did show through the end it wouldn't be
as<00:01:43.060> noticeable<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:44.050> that<00:01:44.200> was<00:01:44.320> more

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
as noticeable and that was more

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.650 
as noticeable and that was more
interested<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.610> checking<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.060> electronics

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
interested in checking the electronics

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.030 
interested in checking the electronics
and<00:01:46.810> seeing<00:01:46.990> how<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.260> work<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.650> this<00:01:47.830> one

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
and seeing how that work on this one

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.250 
and seeing how that work on this one
then<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.000> cosmetic<00:01:49.510> appearance<00:01:49.570> but<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.080> don't

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
then the cosmetic appearance but I don't

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.610 
then the cosmetic appearance but I don't
think<00:01:50.350> it'll<00:01:50.530> be<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.680> problem<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:53.020> hots<00:01:53.230> nodded

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
think it'll be a problem my hots nodded

theirs through the wire nut and soldered
it<00:02:02.050> on<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.350> that<00:02:02.500> side<00:02:02.650> of<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.830> bulb<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:04.060> I

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
it on to that side of the bulb now I

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.580 
it on to that side of the bulb now I
guess<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.270> want<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.570> run<00:02:04.690> all<00:02:04.840> these<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.320> you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
guess you want to run all these and you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.810 
guess you want to run all these and you
know<00:02:05.680> what<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.890> LEDs<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.460> bulb<00:02:06.640> don't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
know what the LEDs on the bulb don't

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.430 
know what the LEDs on the bulb don't
have<00:02:06.910> nuclear<00:02:07.300> fusion<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.840> your<00:02:07.960> car<00:02:08.200> that's

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
have nuclear fusion in your car that's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.530 
have nuclear fusion in your car that's
fine<00:02:08.770> but<00:02:09.100> I'm<00:02:09.460> gonna<00:02:09.580> take<00:02:09.790> these<00:02:09.970> four<00:02:10.210> bulbs

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
fine but I'm gonna take these four bulbs

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.140 
fine but I'm gonna take these four bulbs
out<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.020> then<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:12.010> run<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.280> LEDs<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.910> down

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
out and then just run the LEDs and down

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.880 
out and then just run the LEDs and down
here<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.420> my<00:02:13.510> trimmer<00:02:13.780> pot<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.620> adjust

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
here is my trimmer pot so I can adjust

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.940 
here is my trimmer pot so I can adjust
if<00:02:15.130> they're<00:02:15.280> too<00:02:15.430> bright<00:02:16.470> okay<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.530> what's<00:02:17.800> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
if they're too bright okay so what's the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.670 
if they're too bright okay so what's the
amperage<00:02:18.220> going<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.580> be<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.570> use<00:02:20.080> all<00:02:20.380> four

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
amperage going to be if we use all four

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.860 
amperage going to be if we use all four
of<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.950> factory<00:02:21.490> bulbs<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.000> my<00:02:22.120> LED<00:02:22.510> strip

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
of the factory bulbs in my LED strip

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.900 
of the factory bulbs in my LED strip
let's<00:02:23.650> put<00:02:23.890> at<00:02:24.010> 18<00:02:24.370> volts<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:26.020> about<00:02:27.010> 714

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
let's put at 18 volts and about 714

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.750 
let's put at 18 volts and about 714
milliamps<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.860> I'll<00:02:30.010> pull<00:02:30.190> out<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.310> bulb<00:02:30.610> is

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
milliamps now I'll pull out the bulb is

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.820 
milliamps now I'll pull out the bulb is
one<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> time<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.510> we'll<00:02:31.600> watch<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.780> drop

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:50.680 

you

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.470 

so<00:02:51.680> where'd<00:02:51.830> we<00:02:51.950> stabilize<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.610> at<00:02:52.730> about<00:02:52.820> 43

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so where'd we stabilize in at about 43

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.410 
so where'd we stabilize in at about 43
44<00:02:54.020> milliamps<00:02:54.560> 43<00:02:55.010> milliamps<00:02:55.520> with<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.090> LED

circuit<00:02:57.250> let<00:02:58.250> me<00:02:58.340> start<00:02:58.580> playing<00:02:58.610> with<00:02:58.970> my<00:02:59.090> pot

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
circuit let me start playing with my pot

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.930 
circuit let me start playing with my pot
and<00:02:59.510> see<00:02:59.660> what<00:02:59.810> happens<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.490> way<00:03:04.610> down<00:03:04.640> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and see what happens all the way down to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.660 
and see what happens all the way down to
nothing<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.920> bulbs<00:03:07.250> super<00:03:07.610> low<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:09.550> crank<00:03:10.550> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
nothing the bulbs super low I crank it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.500 
nothing the bulbs super low I crank it
up<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:11.030> go<00:03:11.180> back<00:03:11.360> up<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.750> 43<00:03:12.370> 44<00:03:13.370> now<00:03:14.330> that's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
up we go back up to the 43 44 now that's

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.680 
up we go back up to the 43 44 now that's
a<00:03:14.630> five-k<00:03:15.050> trimmer<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:16.550> believe<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.090> LED

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
a five-k trimmer and I believe the LED

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.790 
a five-k trimmer and I believe the LED
strips<00:03:18.620> have<00:03:18.890> 150<00:03:19.880> ohm<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.360> series<00:03:20.500> built<00:03:21.500> into

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800

strips have 150 ohm in series built into
them<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.670> I'm<00:03:22.790> using<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.090> 47<00:03:23.750> ohm<00:03:24.010> across<00:03:25.010> my

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
them and I'm using a 47 ohm across my

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.480 
them and I'm using a 47 ohm across my
current<00:03:25.940> regulator<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.920> now<00:03:28.010> let's<00:03:28.220> check<00:03:28.310> the

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
current regulator so now let's check the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.490 
current regulator so now let's check the
cap<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.060> see<00:03:29.240> what<00:03:29.510> type<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.750> flicker<00:03:30.260> free

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
cap and see what type of flicker free

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.030 
cap and see what type of flicker free
performance<00:03:31.130> we<00:03:31.280> have<00:03:31.490> I'll<00:03:32.150> simulate<00:03:33.040> you

having some breaks in the current I mean

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.630 
having some breaks in the current I mean
as<00:03:42.500> long<00:03:42.620> as<00:03:42.680> you're<00:03:42.890> just<00:03:43.010> jostling<00:03:43.550> around

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
as long as you're just jostling around

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.820 
as long as you're just jostling around
it's<00:03:44.270> fine<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:45.050> actually<00:03:45.320> pull<00:03:45.680> these

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
it's fine I can actually pull these

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.920 
it's fine I can actually pull these
apart<00:03:45.890> for<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.790> split<00:03:47.600> second<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.320> you<00:03:48.680> know

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
apart for a split second and you know

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.060 
apart for a split second and you know
then<00:03:50.930> they'll<00:03:51.200> then<00:03:51.590> they'll<00:03:51.740> flicker<00:03:51.980> a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
then they'll then they'll flicker a

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.250 
then they'll then they'll flicker a
little<00:03:52.340> bit<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:53.570> can<00:03:53.660> always<00:03:53.780> put<00:03:54.020> a<00:03:54.050> bigger

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
little bit you can always put a bigger

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.010 
little bit you can always put a bigger
cap<00:03:54.530> in<00:03:54.770> this<00:03:54.980> is<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.130> 470<00:03:55.760> micro<00:03:56.060> farad<00:03:56.450> if<00:03:56.930> you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
cap in this is a 470 micro farad if you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.540 
cap in this is a 470 micro farad if you
have<00:03:57.110> room<00:03:57.350> put<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> bigger<00:03:57.800> one<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.100> but<00:03:58.340> I

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
have room put a bigger one in but I

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.520 
have room put a bigger one in but I
think<00:03:59.300> it's<00:03:59.540> going<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.720> be<00:03:59.870> fine<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.110> mean<00:04:00.350> I'm

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
think it's going to be fine I mean I'm

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.020 
think it's going to be fine I mean I'm
actually<00:04:00.680> pulling<00:04:01.010> these<00:04:01.310> things<00:04:01.550> apart<00:04:01.880> at

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
actually pulling these things apart at

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.570 
actually pulling these things apart at
times<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.570> make<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.720> flicker<00:04:03.370> most<00:04:04.370> of<00:04:04.520> the

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
times to make it flicker most of the

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
time with the two pickups that's

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:14.150 
time with the two pickups that's
probably<00:04:06.230> not<00:04:06.380> going<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.590> happen
