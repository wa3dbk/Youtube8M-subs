00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 good afternoon dear subscribers today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:14.910
 we will deal with the fact that we open such cases 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:17.480
 and knock out the knife yes I'm going to knock the knife in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.840
 worst it will be a move in poetry 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 open we will be case-type 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.150
 phoenix to knock out the knife to us 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.199
 will need 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:36.020
 practice the technique is very simple we 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.260
 ten times no well up to 10 you can 10 you can 5 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.410
 in general, we run this ten times 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.270
 roulette and over 10 times unlucky means 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.430
 we are ready to open if ever to us 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
 lucky you 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:56.550
 something below pink i mean this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:02.300
 here you need ten more times as you can see 2 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.750
 1 well here we are lucky and will come now 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.950
 ten times again ran run roulette 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.229
 in fact, you can not run 10 times 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.979
 again 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.810
 but in 10 minutes in the case of ten roses 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.369
 you will lead more 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.220
 probabilities this is officially confirmed 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.930
 experimentally scientific 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 if you want you can read the article 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.439
 confirmed by employees in HP this 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.689
 the article was published completely 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:47.490
 recently and not all yet they know 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:51.740
 believe this article is not a fake article you can 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.610
 will find by the links attached below 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.329
 of i was not lucky last time 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.799
 last time and if we have no luck 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:11.099
 then we are lucky as they say 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:14.069
 today my friend is cheering for me and how 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.610
 only i will drink a knife i will write him off 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.080
 pass the game with subscribers so 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.790

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.700
 can you get a chance to get to me 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.040
 actually in the match in general, the essence 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.610
 is to open the whole 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:44.010
 one single phoenix operation case 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:46.950
 i have three phoenix cases and here's another 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.430
 one phoenix phoenix gun case 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.370
 operations breakthrough for the money 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.060
 by the way you can list some 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.840
 the amount of mail Russia or kicks on 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.200
 kickstarter on the money open 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.930
 shutters cases write it all yourself 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.920
 understand 4 cases four knives at worst 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.130
 case of course it will either azimov 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.910
 or 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.190
 cyrex itself is the worst case 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.829
 Of course, let's get started 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.750
 open the container by the way, you can project 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.190
 will be held golosovaniekakoy 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.139
 still, of these cases, it was necessary 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.489
 open to let these down 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:37.319
 As a result, money will be collected. 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:39.389
 actually so here I probably will choose that 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.139
 what is in the middle like fetus 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.139
 the same 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:55.720
 Well, we remind you knock the knife 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:00.120
 In order to further increase the chances of also 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:04.319
 key knockout must be pronounced 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:10.150
 a little phrase some say 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:12.250
 pentagram draw for this we are 5 times 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.650
 clockwise 5 times counterclockwise 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:20.590
 we enter because we want to drink and 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:25.150
 Say Geybushka Geybushka Give me 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:32.100
