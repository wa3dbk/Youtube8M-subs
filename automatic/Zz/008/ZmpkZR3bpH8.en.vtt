00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.210
 no longer presents you 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.210
 today we are going to start making chicken 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.180
 the cider because it is what more time 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.860
 Take on yourself is very easy to do 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.189
 we are going to need for this recipe a 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.680
 whole chicken salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.210
 We are going to need a liter and a half of cider 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.850
 one is to reduce and another is to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.720
 inject we're going to need onion 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 laurel and parsley this recipe is 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.059
 really very easy it is very comfortable to 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.680
 do because in two seconds guardianship well 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.239
 you are and then you are going to take it off and then 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.610
 will receive your visits so it is very 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.340
 well let's put first reduce to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.390
 fire a little cider 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.390
 with the heart 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 we are going to reduce 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.480
 this cider 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 here 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.430
 so that at least half are made 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.350
 to take consistency there is no need 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.730
 add absolutely nothing already with that 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.140
 it's very good and then we're going to take 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.500
 let's first salpimentar our 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.500
 chicken 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 not everywhere inside is very 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.250
 important because then we forget 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.530
 this area now in here and it's 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.210
 important will work well just because 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.409
 it's just inside to grab all the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.080
 flavor let's flip it 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.890
 and we will return 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.890
 single house 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.250
 now let's inject is here the part 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.619
 of chicken the thickest will be down 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.070
 so it is important to turn it over to 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.039
 grab the meat because if not then here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.590
 is all the bones and this that no no 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.080
 it's not going to grab that much flavor then 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.979
 Here we will grasp with the syringe 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.030
 Doctor Dora is going to inject the chicken 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.170
 crazy looks is going isolating from quesadas it 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.170
 is inflating the chicken 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.890
 beep beep beep beep beep 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.319
 because we are going to inject a bit is a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.319
 little here we will go inflating 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.530
 so that it is well covered with the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.270
 joke is very fun to do so 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 the chicken we are going to inject the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.880
 little legs too 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.590
 look how inflamed is a wonder 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.190
 So start drinking the juices 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.360
 clear that everything 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.730
 there are things that the chick does not want 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.380
 accept but well no way we 're going 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.880
 to recover what we are going to put right now 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.590
 the tray 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.460
 with which we are going to bake our 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.460
 our chicken 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.940
 now let's fill the chicken with the 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.130
 onion let's take the chicken here 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.610
 we are going to open it and we are going to put it 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.610
 onion 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.810
 the onion is what tastes the most 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.370
 giving the chick then is important 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.500
 well put the onion well let's put 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.110
 a good bay leaf 22 leaves of 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.780
 laurel 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.940
 so that you know that you hold the aroma well 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.250
 we do not want to crush these sheets for 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.390
 that they do not fall apart and we're going to put 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.390
 also a little parsley 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.600
 up to them perfect 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.480
 and now as well as being legs up 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.750
 that we are going to place on a plate for 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.940
 to bake 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.319
 the game is still reducing 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.629
 let's also put a garlic 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.909
 in here all this is so that 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.469
 I caught flavor when we took it out of the 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.629
 oven you have to remove all these 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.590
 lots because I put are nice 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.850
 to the palate 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.720
 then we are going to take our 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.810
 chicken 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.940
 we're going to put on the plate 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.840
 we are going to use this same juice for 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.840
 bathe a little 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:38.409
 and we are also going to take the reduction that 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:41.129
 we have here already made of fiber for 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.129
 bathe the chicken 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.489
 it is important that it is well wet 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:50.939
 especially the bottom part because if 

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:54.179
 You can not dry it and it will not get you 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.179
 the taste and texture that we want that 

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:58.520
 have then when the chicken is 

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:00.710
 A) Yes 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.129
 we pay for fire Asia and we're going to 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.690
 bake at 250 degrees one more by 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.490
 half an hour later we are going to download a 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.949
 little temperature and we're going to 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.610
 leave on a very slow heat so that it 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.610
 end of giza 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.620
 then we put it in the back 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.560
 and in what is baked 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.710
 the super chicken we go to a cut and 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.840
 we return with the sheets 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.970
 i 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.380
 step by step chicken to cider salt 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.880
 pepper the chicken and inject it with the 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.919
 half of the city until the fire 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.690
 direct until lightly browned 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.460
 rest of the cider place it on the fire 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.050
 and let reduce by half place inside 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.030
 of chicken onion laurel 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.160
 parsley and garlic put it in a refractory 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.840
 and bake for 3 hours or until the 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.000
 chicken has been cooked varnish 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.389
 constantly and offers with some 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.389
 salad 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.010
 remember that cider due to its 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.320
 Alcohol content should be taken with 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.419
 moderation the alcohol grades of the 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.910
 Cider are around 3.7 degrees 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.910
 that this means that for every liter 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.290
 of cider approximately 3 points 70 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.290
 centiliters are alcohol 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.220
 canon presented
