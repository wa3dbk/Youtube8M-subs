to be kind of a comparison to the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.880 
deviation of the poplar tree definitely
gives<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.760> lot<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.150> spring<00:00:47.630> with<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.050> lot<00:00:48.500> less

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640

splay tip rocker a little bit of taper
here<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:55.910> could<00:00:56.060> definitely<00:00:56.330> float<00:00:56.900> really

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
here it could definitely float really

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.560 
here it could definitely float really
well<00:00:57.710> especially<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.820> these<00:00:59.000> wind<00:00:59.330> buff

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
well especially in these wind buff

conditions the 186 centimeter length has

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.040 
conditions the 186 centimeter length has

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
around a 115 millimeter waist to it

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.600 
around a 115 millimeter waist to it
definitely<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.080> little<00:01:06.500> bit<00:01:06.650> more<00:01:06.980> towards<00:01:07.430> the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
definitely a little bit more towards the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.580 
definitely a little bit more towards the
soft<00:01:07.910> snow<00:01:08.120> side<00:01:08.570> but<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.930> can<00:01:09.050> definitely<00:01:09.200> get

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
soft snow side but it can definitely get

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.820 
soft snow side but it can definitely get
down<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:09.980> harder<00:01:10.340> stuff<00:01:10.400> as<00:01:10.760> well<00:01:11.260> also<00:01:12.260> we've

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
down the harder stuff as well also we've

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.890 
down the harder stuff as well also we've
got<00:01:13.010> carbon<00:01:13.460> fiber<00:01:13.730> built<00:01:14.120> into<00:01:14.480> the<00:01:14.570> bottom

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
got carbon fiber built into the bottom

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.510 
got carbon fiber built into the bottom
of<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.080> ski<00:01:15.410> so<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.370> remains

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
of the ski so that it remains

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.630 
of the ski so that it remains
lightweight<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.050> guys<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.250> know<00:01:19.280> do

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
lightweight so you guys can you know do

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.450 
lightweight so you guys can you know do
those<00:01:19.850> long<00:01:20.240> tours<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.140> not<00:01:21.320> feel<00:01:21.620> so<00:01:22.010> dogged

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
those long tours and not feel so dogged
