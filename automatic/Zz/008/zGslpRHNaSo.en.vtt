00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.010
 we show how to make a white plate 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 you came that is actually the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.670
 Continuation to the pattern of the chocolate 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.050
 We also have it with his fridge 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.070
 the investors like exit with gelatin 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.699
 I have already here 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 prepared with chocolate since right 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.530
 show how to do a jaunt 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 produce and with cocoa powder there are 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 a few weird things I'll give you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.070
 now on the videos I'll show as 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.860
 First, we were at the Schwentine 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.480
 I soaked in water before 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.059
 as the first meeting and doing 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 create the port that is currently 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.520
 the video is also fluid and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.309
 supercooled could now have the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 we make it in red wine or sweet 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.510
 heard that the city then also 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.399
 unfortunately I have it taste 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 nothing gaal in the house and just mouse 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.650
 in parallel, so lucky that I am your children 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.350
 is a color so that is the red 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.020
 and when we see what we do with it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 do and then stop for a while 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.960
 I prepare the chocolate now 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.820
 walk a bit in the water 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.939
 leave that later for the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.000
 Jaunt would have the gelatin this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.410
 let run 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.830
 Imagine it a bit like that 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.380
 sugar press with more taste 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.250
 it has been in the small panne now 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.420
 now no no mandate withdrawn what 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.670
 have small leaf and the gelatin 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 then cool now 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
 i am going to be the schwentine im 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.580
 fridge do that to do this video 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.470
 we can cool and then he has to 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.600
 what I cut you now actually 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.210
 want to show is that was me came and 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.300
 spoon was really funny things 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.160
 were can I believe this has also 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.899
 one already seen there are for me like that 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.149
 the basics which I then like spicy 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.759
 if I work somewhere and now 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.170
 I do not have much time 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.360
 then I put the tour of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.600
 but then the stock would be in danger and violence 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.510
 sprinkle current kavai and frosty 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.489
 the spoon and the gift online 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.310
 remains the imprint of two each 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.560
 on the plate back from the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.630
 principle can expand the if you 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 you can have yourselves from cardboard 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.310
 small stencils cost in heart shape 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.819
 in waveform or 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.530
 depending on what it is because we are too 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.580
 for example three bands shortly 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.239
 it is certain too 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.290
 important is that it can fly up 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.920
 her really great things with it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.410
 do 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.300
 with this cover in parallel can if 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.849
 you can now expand that, for example 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.349
 with the name for example also with 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.540
 powdered sugar which scatters over and then has 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.910
 actually a nice gimmick 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.739
 open tel now has the next trip 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.330
 or what I would like to show now 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:15.160
 is the production of a jaunt with 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:25.099
 best if you ever something happens and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:27.620
 Everything put the inhibition is important 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.220
 that these edges are more accurate in the corner 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.220
 bends 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.340
 and then we fall again well that 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:04:06.340
 the tip bit of stability with 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:09.670
 sanding paper in between direction 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:16.540
 justine of pills from the handling bit 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:18.970
 better and have us with the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.150
 chocolate now before 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.590
 water bath have laid as fluid as 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.740
 So you see in the injection tour is 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.140
 now also important if unfolded 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.200
 version now synonymous no big hole 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.180
 We'll do that with the pair of scissors now 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.640
 we have the special filled that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.790
 I keep coming back so well 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.810
 which is then a bit of pressure on 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.980
 bring it you see it is filled now 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.610
 now we cut the hole in advance 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.040
 should be relatively small because it says so to me 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.540
 the jaunt you have the opportunity 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.650
 also again different forum open 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.770
 to bring a plate 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.140
 creativity would have set no limits 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.870
 It can be nice to draw 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.630
 could look like any now 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.440
 christmas lines are also there for 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.860
 example 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.370
 Key resolutions are not the 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.370
 best 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:32.140
 There is also a nice pattern yet 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.310
 No creativity again 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.980
 borders 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.590
 or could we have to dodge now 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.590
 for example, were also not nice 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.120
 then decorate with ours now 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.070
 Plates out for the must I have but 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.830
 now only the camera was off 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.990
 white chocolate still in the bag 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.210
 I'm going to press now 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.280
 make it relatively easy and work now 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:05.170
 with squares with any lines 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.950
 and I do not really see it today 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.360
 creative and now everything does not look that way 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.360
 great as it would like 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.400
 you see the gelatin these are too 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.979
 become firm 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:38.720
 until now here in the room for central now 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:42.580
 to get clean out of the valley 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.580
 you have to play a bit 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:49.030
 Classics again from me that the notes 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.710
 to cut 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.360
 you now have back again later 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.280
 if your heart is weaker now 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.919
 I would now prick my heart out 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.889
 so I did not have you cards 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:07.789
 yes in other videos we have with 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:10.000
 the polenta cut on it now 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:12.740
 we are the Russian roulette equal 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.810
 cut out or best if you like that 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.000
 nice in lockenhaus pull what you for 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.580
 need is a pot of hot water 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.159
 our now cooked around the 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.630
 Muscles get out there only with 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:27.229
 spoon the hot water 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.610
 go here once in the in 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:33.500
 the key 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:40.490
 it is there to tell and then it 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:43.659
 make a curl out of it 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:46.210
 we still open this 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:51.490
 you have to have a very good consistency 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.490
 like personally almost a bit too tight 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.970
 we come to be seen again is not 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:00.870
 hard I was glad that you 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:04.620
 I am pleased about it 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.340
 every abo about every click and up to 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.720
 next time 

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.720
 thanks for turning on
