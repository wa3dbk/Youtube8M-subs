00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.240 

my<00:00:00.780> approach<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.079> teaching<00:00:01.319> sixth<00:00:02.100> grade

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
my approach to teaching sixth grade

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.820 
my approach to teaching sixth grade
science<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.879> that<00:00:02.939> even<00:00:03.750> as<00:00:04.020> sixth<00:00:04.529> graders

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
science is that even as sixth graders

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.380 
science is that even as sixth graders
and<00:00:05.009> most<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.279> them<00:00:05.430> are<00:00:05.520> about<00:00:05.730> 11<00:00:06.240> or<00:00:06.330> 12

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
and most of them are about 11 or 12

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.099 
and most of them are about 11 or 12
years<00:00:06.660> old

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
years old

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.919 
years old
they<00:00:08.069> aren't<00:00:08.309> students<00:00:09.000> who<00:00:09.210> are<00:00:09.330> learning

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
they aren't students who are learning

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.039 
they aren't students who are learning
about<00:00:10.139> science<00:00:10.950> they<00:00:11.130> actually<00:00:11.580> are<00:00:11.849> or<00:00:12.630> need

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
about science they actually are or need

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.589 
about science they actually are or need
to<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.380> scientists<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.849> when<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> greet

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
to be scientists and so when I greet

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.939 
to be scientists and so when I greet
them<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> morning<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> I'll<00:00:16.650> say<00:00:16.800> good

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
them in the morning and I'll say good

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010 
them in the morning and I'll say good
morning<00:00:17.279> students<00:00:17.820> or<00:00:18.000> good<00:00:18.359> morning<00:00:18.600> class<00:00:18.810> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
morning students or good morning class I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
morning students or good morning class I
say<00:00:19.170> good<00:00:19.350> morning<00:00:19.619> scientists<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.460> they

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
say good morning scientists and they

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.939 
say good morning scientists and they
reply<00:00:21.150> good<00:00:21.359> morning<00:00:21.630> mr.<00:00:21.869> C<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.740> want

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
reply good morning mr. C because I want

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.439 
reply good morning mr. C because I want
them<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> internalize<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> fact<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.210> if

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
them to internalize the fact that if

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.230 
them to internalize the fact that if
they<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.039> act<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.760> certain<00:00:27.090> way

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
they think and act in a certain way

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.179 
they think and act in a certain way
they're<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.779> science<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> they're<00:00:29.010> being

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
they're doing science and they're being

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.190 
they're doing science and they're being
scientists<00:00:32.660> good<00:00:33.660> morning<00:00:33.930> scientist<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
scientists good morning scientist and so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
scientists good morning scientist and so
I<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.250> able<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.550> teach<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I think that to be able to teach that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
I think that to be able to teach that
the<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.110> thing<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> immediately<00:00:41.100> comes<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the the thing that immediately comes to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540 
the the thing that immediately comes to
mind<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.210> skills<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.530> science<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
mind is skills because science is not a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
mind is skills because science is not a
collection<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.120> facts<00:00:45.390> necessarily<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
collection of facts necessarily or a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
collection of facts necessarily or a
list<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> words<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.270> list<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.719> things<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
list of words or a list of things you

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
list of words or a list of things you
need<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> world<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
need to know about the world it's a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.959 
need to know about the world it's a
skill<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.949> skill<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.489> learning<00:00:53.820> more

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
skill that it's a skill of learning more

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660 
skill that it's a skill of learning more
about<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.539> world<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.070> for<00:00:56.070> example<00:00:56.489> if

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
about the world so for example if

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
about the world so for example if
they're<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:56.969> dissect<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.750> grasshopper<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
they're gonna dissect a grasshopper in

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
they're gonna dissect a grasshopper in
my<00:00:58.890> class<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> just

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
my class they don't need to just

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
my class they don't need to just
memorize<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> different<00:01:02.039> parts<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
memorize the different parts of a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
memorize the different parts of a
grasshopper<00:01:02.879> they<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> learn<00:01:04.080> certain

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
grasshopper they need to learn certain

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.219 
grasshopper they need to learn certain
skills<00:01:04.710> they<00:01:04.920> need<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> learn<00:01:05.339> how<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.200> how<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
skills they need to learn how to how to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.399 
skills they need to learn how to how to
find<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.689> ventral<00:01:09.689> side<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> grasshopper

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
find the ventral side of the grasshopper

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.240 
find the ventral side of the grasshopper
how<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> identify<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.320> two<00:01:13.380> small

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
how how to identify you know two small

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
how how to identify you know two small
membranes<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.020> on

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
membranes that are on the that are on

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.370 
membranes that are on the that are on
the<00:01:16.290> anterior<00:01:17.000> dorsal<00:01:18.000> end<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the anterior dorsal end of the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
the anterior dorsal end of the
grasshopper<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
grasshopper and I so I think that what I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.820 
grasshopper and I so I think that what I
try<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.170> teach<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
try to do is not just teach the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
try to do is not just teach the
knowledge<00:01:23.009> piece<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.729> would<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.090> these<00:01:24.659> are

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
knowledge piece which would be these are

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
knowledge piece which would be these are
the<00:01:24.900> parts<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> grasshopper<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.460> know

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the parts of the grasshopper you know

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399 
the parts of the grasshopper you know
get<00:01:26.790> ready<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.360> ready<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.290> would

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
get ready get ready to see them it would

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
get ready get ready to see them it would
be<00:01:28.560> here's<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.369> gonna<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.759> when

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
be here's what you're gonna do when

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
be here's what you're gonna do when
you're<00:01:30.540> dissecting<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.409> order<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> find<00:01:32.220> them

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you're dissecting in order to find them

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.620 
you're dissecting in order to find them
what<00:01:32.640> we're<00:01:32.759> gonna<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.090> today<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.390> we're<00:01:33.540> gonna

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna
learn<00:01:33.869> how<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> understand<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> instructions

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
learn how to understand the instructions

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.010 
learn how to understand the instructions
that<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:35.759> getting<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> high<00:01:36.689> school

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that we're getting so in high school

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.780 
that we're getting so in high school
someone<00:01:37.439> might<00:01:37.680> come<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.280> teacher<00:01:38.490> might

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
someone might come up your teacher might

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460 
someone might come up your teacher might
actually<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.329> lay<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> cat<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
actually just lay the cat out for you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.069 
actually just lay the cat out for you
and<00:01:40.650> say<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.250> steps<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.880> through<00:01:41.909> ten<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.630> mean

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and say do steps one through ten I mean

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.420 
and say do steps one through ten I mean
hopefully<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.710> show<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> do

look at number one it says you're gonna
start<00:01:57.930> by<00:01:58.079> looking<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> instructions
