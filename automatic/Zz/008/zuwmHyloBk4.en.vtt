so<00:00:00.329> you<00:00:00.390> might<00:00:00.599> have<00:00:00.719> heard<00:00:00.780> of<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.650> thing

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
so you might have heard of this thing

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.830 
so you might have heard of this thing
called<00:00:02.190> thermal<00:00:02.700> paste<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.270> let<00:00:03.389> me<00:00:03.480> tell<00:00:03.659> you

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
called thermal paste and let me tell you

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.039 
called thermal paste and let me tell you
what<00:00:04.020> it's<00:00:04.170> for

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
what it's for

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.540 
what it's for
juggling<00:00:07.049> actually<00:00:07.710> not<00:00:07.859> what<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.130> for<00:00:08.400> at<00:00:08.460> all

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
juggling actually not what is for at all

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.060 
juggling actually not what is for at all
but<00:00:08.730> it's<00:00:08.849> really<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.780> applying<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
but it's really for is applying to a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.990

transfer that heat away from it where it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
the line method the rationale was back
when<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.299> dyes<00:02:00.509> were<00:02:00.780> getting<00:02:01.049> larger<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> we

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
when the dyes were getting larger and we

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.039 
when the dyes were getting larger and we
were<00:02:02.310> first<00:02:02.579> seeing<00:02:02.759> quad<00:02:03.119> cores<00:02:03.450> from<00:02:03.659> Intel

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
were first seeing quad cores from Intel

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
were first seeing quad cores from Intel
we<00:02:04.469> were<00:02:04.619> seeing<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.280> were<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.610> square

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
we were seeing that they were not square

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.300 
we were seeing that they were not square
in<00:02:06.210> shape<00:02:06.240> anymore<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.469> was<00:02:07.619> beneficial<00:02:08.069> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
in shape anymore so it was beneficial to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
in shape anymore so it was beneficial to
put<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> line<00:02:08.819> down<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.119> middle<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> CPU<00:02:10.170> in

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
put a line down the middle of the CPU in

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.010 
put a line down the middle of the CPU in
the<00:02:10.590> orientation<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.670> where<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.540> dyes<00:02:12.750> were

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the orientation of where the dyes were

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
the orientation of where the dyes were
located

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
located

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.410 
located
under<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> heat<00:02:14.190> spreader<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.970> line<00:02:15.180> method

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
under the heat spreader the line method

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.680 
under the heat spreader the line method
is<00:02:15.989> effective<00:02:16.860> as<00:02:17.040> well<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.450> really

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
is effective as well but it's not really

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.960 
is effective as well but it's not really
going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> generate<00:02:19.260> better<00:02:19.440> results<00:02:19.970> unless

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
going to generate better results unless

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.490 
going to generate better results unless
you<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> CPU<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.050> particularly

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you have a CPU that particularly

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
you have a CPU that particularly
benefits<00:02:23.220> from<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.000> old<00:02:24.209> fashioned

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
benefits from it the old fashioned

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.809 
benefits from it the old fashioned
method<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.470> some<00:02:25.830> people<00:02:26.190> still<00:02:26.430> use<00:02:26.610> today

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
method that some people still use today

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.290 
method that some people still use today
but<00:02:27.180> has<00:02:27.360> been<00:02:27.630> sort<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.989> debunked<00:02:28.709> as<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
but has been sort of debunked as a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.150 
but has been sort of debunked as a
necessary<00:02:30.300> step<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.260> spreading<00:02:31.650> method

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
necessary step is the spreading method

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.680 
necessary step is the spreading method
so<00:02:32.519> that's<00:02:32.700> where<00:02:32.910> you'll<00:02:33.000> put<00:02:33.209> some<00:02:33.390> thermal

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so that's where you'll put some thermal

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.420 
so that's where you'll put some thermal
compound<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.349> middle<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> CPU<00:02:35.220> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
compound in the middle of the CPU and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.850 
compound in the middle of the CPU and
use<00:02:35.640> something<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.150> credit<00:02:36.690> card<00:02:36.959> or<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
use something like a credit card or a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.890 
use something like a credit card or a

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
spread it around this was mostly useful

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.240 
spread it around this was mostly useful
for<00:02:42.510> very<00:02:42.870> old<00:02:43.080> thermal<00:02:43.530> compounds<00:02:44.099> such<00:02:44.220> as

for very old thermal compounds such as

you're running the same system so that's

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
silver 5 does tend to perform a little

now<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.069> should<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.519> noted<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.709> sometimes

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
now it should be noted that sometimes
