00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.070 
you know for every every situation
throughout<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> game<00:02:28.700> scar-l<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.660> my<00:02:29.750> opinion

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
throughout the game scar-l in my opinion

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.800 
throughout the game scar-l in my opinion
is<00:02:30.170> probably<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.740> best<00:02:30.980> gun<00:02:31.160> in<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> game

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
is probably the best gun in the game

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.020 
is probably the best gun in the game
it's<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:33.110> extremely<00:02:33.739> extremely<00:02:34.280> versatile

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's just extremely extremely versatile

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.170 
it's just extremely extremely versatile
you<00:02:35.329> can<00:02:35.480> fight<00:02:35.959> from<00:02:36.170> distance

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
you can fight from distance

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.860 
you can fight from distance
up<00:02:37.390> close<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.209> weird<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> me<00:02:40.719> that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
up close and it's just weird to me that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.470 
up close and it's just weird to me that
I<00:02:40.900> don't<00:02:41.019> see<00:02:41.379> anyone<00:02:41.769> ever<00:02:41.969> ever<00:02:42.969> using<00:02:43.359> this

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
I don't see anyone ever ever using this

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.699 
I don't see anyone ever ever using this
anymore<00:02:43.689> I<00:02:43.900> guess<00:02:44.079> they<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.260> forgot<00:02:44.650> about

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
anymore I guess they just forgot about

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.849 
anymore I guess they just forgot about
it<00:02:44.980> but<00:02:45.510> if<00:02:46.510> you're<00:02:46.629> scar-l<00:02:46.989> fan<00:02:47.409> go<00:02:47.620> ahead<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
it but if you're scar-l fan go ahead and

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.009 
it but if you're scar-l fan go ahead and
leave<00:02:47.980> me<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.159> comment<00:02:48.459> let<00:02:49.239> me<00:02:49.329> know<00:02:49.510> if<00:02:49.840> this

I<00:02:52.659> love<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> scar-l<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.859> love<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.159> since

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
I love the scar-l I love this since

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.119 
I love the scar-l I love this since
modern<00:02:54.639> warfare<00:02:54.760> 2<00:02:54.939> when<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.269> was<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.540> scar-h

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
modern warfare 2 when it was the scar-h

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.500 
modern warfare 2 when it was the scar-h
but<00:02:57.129> it's<00:02:57.430> pretty<00:02:57.609> much<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.879> same<00:02:57.909> gun<00:02:58.359> they

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
but it's pretty much the same gun they

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.020 
but it's pretty much the same gun they
just<00:02:58.659> tweaked<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.139> couple<00:02:59.439> things<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.829> it<00:03:00.030> but

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
just tweaked a couple things to it but

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.089 
just tweaked a couple things to it but
yeah<00:03:01.120> guys<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.930> strategy<00:03:02.319> I'm<00:03:02.409> using<00:03:02.620> here<00:03:02.920> I

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
yeah guys the strategy I'm using here I

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.110 
yeah guys the strategy I'm using here I
know<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.370> guys<00:03:03.549> always<00:03:03.700> want<00:03:03.879> to<00:03:03.909> know<00:03:03.969> about

know you guys always want to know about

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.839 
know you guys always want to know about
these<00:03:04.299> strategies<00:03:05.370> there's<00:03:06.370> nothing<00:03:06.639> real

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
these strategies there's nothing real

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.569 
these strategies there's nothing real
major<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.389> know<00:03:07.510> I'm<00:03:07.989> pretty<00:03:08.260> much<00:03:08.469> just<00:03:08.579> I'd

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
major you know I'm pretty much just I'd

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.550 
major you know I'm pretty much just I'd
like<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:10.120> actually<00:03:10.540> stick<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.260> side<00:03:11.530> of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
like to actually stick to this side of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.009 
like to actually stick to this side of
the<00:03:11.709> map<00:03:11.950> I'm<00:03:12.250> running<00:03:12.849> between<00:03:12.970> AMC<00:03:13.689> and

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the map I'm running between AMC and

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.140 
the map I'm running between AMC and
occasionally<00:03:15.010> glancing<00:03:15.129> up<00:03:15.519> towards<00:03:15.790> B<00:03:15.939> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
occasionally glancing up towards B I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.970 
occasionally glancing up towards B I
tend<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.510> stay<00:03:16.720> out<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.139> upstairs<00:03:17.650> area

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
tend to stay out of that upstairs area

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.699 
tend to stay out of that upstairs area
here<00:03:18.340> by<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.519> domme<00:03:18.879> because<00:03:19.780> there's<00:03:20.470> too<00:03:20.590> many

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
here by a domme because there's too many

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.199 
here by a domme because there's too many
flanks<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.250> get<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.639> that<00:03:21.790> building<00:03:22.000> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
flanks to get up in that building and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.490 
flanks to get up in that building and
you<00:03:22.269> definitely<00:03:22.629> don't<00:03:22.719> want<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:22.959> camp<00:03:23.200> inside

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
you definitely don't want to camp inside

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.059 
you definitely don't want to camp inside
there<00:03:23.879> you<00:03:24.879> know<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.209> get<00:03:25.389> if<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.709> happen

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
there you know if you get if you happen

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.709 
there you know if you get if you happen
to<00:03:27.099> trap<00:03:27.849> them<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.120> C<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.450> you're<00:03:28.569> in<00:03:28.629> that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:28.719 
to trap them on C and you're in that

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.940 
to trap them on C and you're in that
building<00:03:28.959> in<00:03:29.139> this<00:03:29.260> palm<00:03:29.469> flips<00:03:29.769> they're

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
building in this palm flips they're

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.309 
building in this palm flips they're
gonna<00:03:30.069> spawn<00:03:30.310> directly<00:03:30.760> behind<00:03:30.909> you<00:03:31.239> right<00:03:32.230> in

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
gonna spawn directly behind you right in

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.289 
gonna spawn directly behind you right in
that<00:03:32.409> circular<00:03:32.980> building<00:03:33.340> by<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.489> Don<00:03:33.819> so<00:03:34.060> I

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
that circular building by a Don so I

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.089 
that circular building by a Don so I
tend<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.989> stay<00:03:35.230> completely<00:03:35.560> out<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.980> that

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
tend to stay completely out of that

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.920 
tend to stay completely out of that
direction<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.669> just<00:03:36.879> rotate<00:03:37.359> like<00:03:37.540> I'm<00:03:37.689> doing

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
direction I just rotate like I'm doing

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.199 
direction I just rotate like I'm doing

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.960 
of the back of B but yeah let's see
let's<00:03:53.769> talk<00:03:53.919> a<00:03:53.949> little<00:03:54.069> bit<00:03:54.280> about<00:03:54.400> black<00:03:54.699> ops

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
let's talk a little bit about black ops

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.909 
let's talk a little bit about black ops
2<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.299> know<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.569> lot<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.930> informations<00:03:56.470> been

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
2 I know a lot of informations been

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.699 
2 I know a lot of informations been
leaked<00:03:57.659> you<00:03:58.659> know<00:03:58.780> there's<00:03:59.199> so<00:03:59.590> much

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
leaked you know there's so much

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.559 
leaked you know there's so much
information<00:03:59.889> I<00:04:00.340> tend<00:04:00.639> to<00:04:00.760> stay<00:04:01.209> away<00:04:01.239> from

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
information I tend to stay away from

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.599
