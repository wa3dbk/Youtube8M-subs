for this mission we will be needing his

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.779 
for this mission we will be needing his
heels<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:23.279> don't<00:00:23.550> have

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
heels on this one because we don't have

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.910 
heels on this one because we don't have
much<00:00:24.060> room<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.539> move<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.199> will<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.560> taking

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
much room to move and we will be taking

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.600 
much room to move and we will be taking
a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> damage<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:29.840> again<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.550> try<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
a lot of damage so again just try to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.549 
a lot of damage so again just try to
move<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.120> much<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.480> possible<00:00:33.690> since<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> can't

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
move as much as possible since you can't

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
move as much as possible since you can't
really<00:00:34.649> take<00:00:35.010> advantage<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.700> range<00:00:36.030> here

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
really take advantage of your range here

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.459 
really take advantage of your range here
you<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> move<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.840> try<00:00:39.840> shoot<00:00:40.230> them

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you just have to move and try shoot them

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.049 
you just have to move and try shoot them
without<00:00:40.770> getting<00:00:41.070> shot<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.940> possible

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.160 

so<00:00:48.059> hopefully<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.750> we've<00:00:48.840> cleared<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so hopefully now that we've cleared the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
so hopefully now that we've cleared the
top<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.739> take<00:00:49.950> advantage<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.489> range<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
top we can take advantage of range for a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.240 
top we can take advantage of range for a
little<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:53.750> now<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:55.019> in<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> other<00:00:55.800> mission

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
little bit now like in the other mission

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.299 
little bit now like in the other mission
I<00:00:56.370> said<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.879> other<00:00:57.120> survival<00:00:57.720> mission<00:00:58.309> your

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I said the other survival mission your

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
I said the other survival mission your
medic<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.969> passively<00:01:00.540> heal<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.350> your

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
medic will passively heal all your

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
medic will passively heal all your
troops<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.659> heal<00:01:03.930> himself<00:01:05.540> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
troops but you will not heal himself so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
troops but you will not heal himself so
you<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.899> be<00:01:06.990> careful<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.770> medic

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you have to be careful about your medic

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.320 
you have to be careful about your medic
taking<00:01:08.580> damage<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.880> medic<00:01:12.180> takes

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
taking damage so if your medic takes

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
taking damage so if your medic takes
damage<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> hope<00:01:13.440> that<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
damage you have to hope that one of the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.350 
damage you have to hope that one of the
enemies<00:01:14.430> drops<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.880> medi-pack

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
enemies drops a medi-pack

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.889 
enemies drops a medi-pack
or<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> medi-pack<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.720> can

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
or you get a medi-pack or you can

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.130 
or you get a medi-pack or you can
purchase<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.410> medevac<00:01:19.830> drop<00:01:20.179> if<00:01:21.179> your<00:01:21.420> regular

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
purchase a medevac drop if your regular

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.800 
purchase a medevac drop if your regular
troops<00:01:22.410> get<00:01:23.340> shot<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:24.000> medic<00:01:24.330> will<00:01:24.539> heal

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
troops get shot your medic will heal

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
troops get shot your medic will heal
them<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.640> try<00:01:26.789> not<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.149> shot

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
them just try not to get shot

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.440 
them just try not to get shot
too<00:01:27.780> much<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.320> his<00:01:29.250> healing<00:01:29.759> isn't<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
too much because his healing isn't that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
too much because his healing isn't that
fast<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.009> we're<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.399> halfway

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
fast so I think we're about halfway

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
fast so I think we're about halfway
through<00:01:35.970> now<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.690> clear<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.259> top

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
through now if we can clear out the top

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.680 
through now if we can clear out the top
guys<00:01:40.860> here<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.429> can<00:01:41.700> take<00:01:41.909> advantage<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.570> your

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
guys here you can take advantage of your

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.720

this<00:01:49.300> guy<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.570> gonna<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.020> biggest<00:01:50.230> trouble

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

in<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.490> medi-pack

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
in a medi-pack

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.920 
in a medi-pack
right<00:02:32.410> about<00:02:32.590> now<00:02:32.650> anyway<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.750> just

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
right about now anyway so that just

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.100 
right about now anyway so that just
saves<00:02:35.170> me<00:02:35.290> 10,000<00:02:36.220> points<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:37.570> we<00:02:37.720> are<00:02:37.840> near

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
saves me 10,000 points but we are near

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.810 
saves me 10,000 points but we are near
at<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> very<00:02:38.470> end<00:02:38.680> now<00:02:38.890> she's<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.520> gonna<00:02:39.640> be

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
at the very end now she's not gonna be

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.250 
at the very end now she's not gonna be
many<00:02:40.000> enemies<00:02:40.420> left<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:43.630> go<00:02:43.870> over<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
many enemies left you go over there and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.840 
many enemies left you go over there and
we<00:02:44.350> get<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.770> grenade<00:02:45.100> that's<00:02:45.340> gonna<00:02:45.700> be

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
we get that grenade that's gonna be

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.600 
we get that grenade that's gonna be
useful<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.590> think<00:02:47.800> this<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.310> last

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
useful now so I think this is the last

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.310 
useful now so I think this is the last
wave<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.150> enemies<00:02:49.480> that's<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.050> show<00:02:50.170> up

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
wave of enemies that's going to show up

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.260 
wave of enemies that's going to show up
I<00:02:55.440> think<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.040> last<00:02:57.280> wave<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.730> enemies<00:02:58.060> are

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
I think this is last wave of enemies are

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.780 
I think this is last wave of enemies are
not<00:02:58.450> entirely<00:02:58.810> sure<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.490> you<00:03:00.490> know<00:03:00.520> these

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
not entirely sure but you know these

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.760 
not entirely sure but you know these
survival<00:03:01.330> missions<00:03:01.630> they<00:03:01.990> don't<00:03:02.200> last<00:03:02.440> too

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
survival missions they don't last too

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.170 
survival missions they don't last too
long<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:06.220> grenade<00:03:06.459> should<00:03:06.790> take<00:03:06.940> care<00:03:07.120> of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
long so that grenade should take care of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.990 
long so that grenade should take care of
all<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.360> them<00:03:11.100> not<00:03:12.100> gonna<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.400> many<00:03:12.610> enemies

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
all of them not gonna be many enemies

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.790 
all of them not gonna be many enemies
left<00:03:13.239> now<00:03:13.480> just<00:03:13.750> appeal<00:03:14.020> from<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.260> top<00:03:14.530> I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
left now just appeal from the top I

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.610 
left now just appeal from the top I
believe<00:03:15.070> maybe<00:03:15.720> some<00:03:16.720> more<00:03:16.930> from<00:03:17.170> one<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
believe maybe some more from one of the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.459 
believe maybe some more from one of the
directions<00:03:18.160> below

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:24.469 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.949 

you<00:03:25.469> go<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.859> grenade

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
you go that grenade

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.179 
you go that grenade
we<00:03:27.959> lost<00:03:28.170> our<00:03:28.379> medic<00:03:29.069> not<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.879> worry<00:03:30.950> these<00:03:31.950> are

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
we lost our medic not to worry these are

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.780 
we lost our medic not to worry these are
the<00:03:32.400> last<00:03:32.549> guys<00:03:32.849> so<00:03:33.599> there<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.620> have<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.890> that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the last guys so there you have it that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.330 
the last guys so there you have it that
is<00:03:35.939> how<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.230> three-star<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.590> survival

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
is how you three-star this survival

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.050 
is how you three-star this survival
mission<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:39.659> keep<00:03:40.109> moving<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.849> clear<00:03:41.849> out

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
mission just keep moving and clear out

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.000 
mission just keep moving and clear out
the<00:03:42.239> guys<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.750> top<00:03:42.959> first<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.680> can

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
the guys on the top first so you can

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.309 
the guys on the top first so you can
take<00:03:44.280> advantage<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.909> your<00:03:45.030> range<00:03:45.359> by<00:03:45.689> shooting

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
take advantage of your range by shooting

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.860 
take advantage of your range by shooting
down<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.819> anyway<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.239> not<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.540> difficult

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
down so anyway it's not a difficult

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.720 
down so anyway it's not a difficult
mission<00:03:49.290> if<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> bring<00:03:49.739> your<00:03:49.889> medic<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.489> get

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
mission if you bring your medic and get

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.670 
mission if you bring your medic and get
all<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:50.969> upgrades<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.659> should<00:03:52.139> go<00:03:52.230> by<00:03:52.379> pretty

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
all the upgrades it should go by pretty

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.989 
all the upgrades it should go by pretty
easily<00:03:52.889> so<00:03:53.879> that's<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.689> this<00:03:54.810> video
