your medical surgical area as well
particularly<00:01:07.860> around<00:01:08.010> learning<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.580> example

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
particularly around learning for example

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.929 
particularly around learning for example
resuscitation<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> patient<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.850> are

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
resuscitation of a patient so there are

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
resuscitation of a patient so there are
many<00:01:12.090> examples<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.930> simulation<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.619> we'll

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
many examples of simulation that we'll

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
many examples of simulation that we'll
be<00:01:13.890> introducing<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> during<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.360> three

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
be introducing you to during your three

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
be introducing you to during your three
years<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.320> studies<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> third<00:01:18.060> year

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

years of your studies in the third year
of<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.479> Bachelor<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> Nursing<00:01:19.140> program

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of your Bachelor of Nursing program

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.350 
of your Bachelor of Nursing program
you'll<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.860> engaged<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> simulation

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you'll be engaged in the simulation

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
you'll be engaged in the simulation
around<00:01:21.600> hearing<00:01:21.930> voices<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.920> mental

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
around hearing voices in your mental

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
around hearing voices in your mental
health<00:01:23.369> subject<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.780> perioperative

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
health subject and in your perioperative

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
health subject and in your perioperative
subject<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:25.979> example<00:01:26.070> you'll<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.820> engaged<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
subject for example you'll be engaged in

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.350 
subject for example you'll be engaged in
preparing<00:01:27.720> patients<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.680> theatre<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
preparing patients for theatre and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.660 
preparing patients for theatre and
understanding<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> deteriorating<00:01:31.049> patient

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
understanding the deteriorating patient

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.740 
understanding the deteriorating patient
so<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.820> example<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.630> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so for example when you go out in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
so for example when you go out in
practice<00:01:34.200> you'll<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.530> already<00:01:34.829> started<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
practice you'll have already started to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.499 
practice you'll have already started to
feel<00:01:35.640> comfortable<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
feel comfortable about how to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
feel comfortable about how to
communicate<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> patients<00:01:37.710> you'll

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
communicate with the patients you'll

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
communicate with the patients you'll
feel<00:01:38.040> comfortable<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.640> wearing<00:01:38.939> your<00:01:39.180> uniform

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
feel comfortable in wearing your uniform

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
feel comfortable in wearing your uniform
when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> go<00:01:39.990> into<00:01:40.229> practice<00:01:40.680> you'll<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.460> an

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
when you go into practice you'll have an

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
when you go into practice you'll have an
understanding<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> importance<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.170> how

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
understanding of the importance of how

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.020 
understanding of the importance of how
you<00:01:43.710> approach<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.310> patient<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you approach a patient and how you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.580
