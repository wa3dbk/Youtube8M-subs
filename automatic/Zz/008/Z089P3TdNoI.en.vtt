whiskey Mac what I made the other models
I<00:00:49.500> use<00:00:50.500> this<00:00:50.680> gardening<00:00:51.160> wire<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:52.660> had<00:00:52.809> a

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
I use this gardening wire which had a

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.080 
I use this gardening wire which had a
bit<00:00:53.019> of<00:00:53.050> stiff<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.859> thought<00:00:54.219> of<00:00:54.370> you<00:00:54.489> bend<00:00:54.879> so

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
bit of stiff and thought of you bend so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.869 
bit of stiff and thought of you bend so
I'm<00:00:55.180> going<00:00:55.359> to<00:00:55.390> try<00:00:55.949> using<00:00:56.949> this<00:00:57.250> beading<00:00:57.670> wire

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
I'm going to try using this beading wire

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.639 
I'm going to try using this beading wire
this<00:00:58.690> time<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.890> then<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.730> glue<00:01:00.969> or<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.649> play

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
this time and then the glue or the play

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.149 
this time and then the glue or the play
and<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:03.519> use<00:01:03.699> with<00:01:03.940> this<00:01:04.059> fimo<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:05.170> pound<00:01:05.619> 69

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
and I use with this fimo on pound 69

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.789 
and I use with this fimo on pound 69
does<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.240> mother<00:01:07.509> use<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:08.049> that<00:01:08.590> little

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
does that mother use that that little

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.429 
does that mother use that that little
bit<00:01:09.009> there<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.420> make<00:01:10.570> those<00:01:10.780> three<00:01:11.080> models

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
bit there to make those three models

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.760 
bit there to make those three models
that's<00:01:11.650> very<00:01:12.210> economical<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.530> then<00:01:14.680> I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
that's very economical and then I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.090 
that's very economical and then I
painted<00:01:15.280> anything<00:01:16.090> with<00:01:16.650> cheap<00:01:17.650> set<00:01:17.920> of

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
alright well first we have to do cut it

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.460 
alright well first we have to do cut it
to<00:01:31.540> length<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.899> wire<00:01:33.149> one<00:01:34.149> length<00:01:34.420> for<00:01:34.899> twice

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
to length of wire one length for twice

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.260 
to length of wire one length for twice
the<00:01:35.829> length<00:01:36.009> times<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> height<00:01:36.850> for<00:01:37.180> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
the length times the height for the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.249 
the length times the height for the
first<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.570> want<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.780> be<00:01:37.899> plus<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.350> little<00:01:38.710> bit

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
first you want to be plus a little bit

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.030 
first you want to be plus a little bit
so<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.290> you've<00:01:41.649> got<00:01:41.829> plenty<00:01:42.579> clamp<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.420> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so that you've got plenty clamp on to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.310 
so that you've got plenty clamp on to
you<00:01:45.040> bend<00:01:45.369> it<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.610> half<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:46.270> little<00:01:46.600> twist<00:01:47.170> in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
you bend it in half a little twist in

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.060 
you bend it in half a little twist in
the<00:01:47.409> top<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:49.149> form<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.290> head<00:01:50.439> that's<00:01:50.890> one

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
the top to form the head that's one

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.280 
the top to form the head that's one
little<00:01:51.219> twist<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.259> then<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.500> put<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.920> other

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
little twist and then we put the other

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
little twist and then we put the other
length<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.640> twist<00:01:59.130> do<00:02:00.130> that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.420 

eggless<00:02:04.360> hardened<00:02:04.870> so<00:02:05.740> here<00:02:05.980> we<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
eggless hardened so here we have the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.320 
eggless hardened so here we have the
arms<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.929> body<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.270> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

two<00:02:13.660> legs<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:15.100> longer<00:02:15.490> than<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.670> others<00:02:15.880> I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
two legs one longer than the others I

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.070 
two legs one longer than the others I
said<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.480> we<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.860> hold<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.070> in<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> clips<00:02:19.080> and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
said so we can hold it in the clips and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.260 
said so we can hold it in the clips and
now<00:02:20.680> when<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.400> straight<00:02:21.730> his<00:02:21.880> head<00:02:22.030> up<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
now when you straight his head up a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.830 
now when you straight his head up a
little<00:02:22.420> bit<00:02:27.090> now<00:02:28.090> we've<00:02:28.240> got<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> gun

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
little bit now we've got a gun

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.090 
little bit now we've got a gun
getting<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.040> right<00:02:30.250> shape<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.640> hold<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:32.100> on

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
getting the right shape to hold the on

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.830 
getting the right shape to hold the on
to<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.760> handrails<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:37.090> his<00:02:37.239> feet<00:02:37.660> on

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
to the handrails and have his feet on

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.890 
to the handrails and have his feet on
the<00:02:37.959> stairs<00:02:40.530> well<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:41.800> we've<00:02:42.340> got<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the stairs well I think we've got the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.050 
the stairs well I think we've got the
basic<00:02:43.900> shape<00:02:43.930> there<00:02:44.500> he's<00:02:45.459> arms<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
basic shape there he's arms up in the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.510 
basic shape there he's arms up in the
air<00:02:46.239> ollie<00:02:47.170> onto<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.560> balance<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.980> one<00:02:48.280> big

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
air ollie onto the balance is one big
