 thanks, finally, a trek with mine 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.560
 names and a unique identifier 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 I think it's really great and wonderful 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.980
 the carrier is of course really great 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:45.210
 I really like it a bit 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 gimmicks here with trainer and for 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.040

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.040
 he can drive really great 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.070
 We regret to put it that way 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.070
 believed now 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 a little bit has to be students here 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.750
 So there you look really great 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.210
 and does not drive that way 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.990
 rabid same but nice said cousin 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.470
 go backwards just as depressed 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 not himself 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.890
 of course 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.840
 on the wrong side 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.290
 blinker 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.290
 Left Right 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.040
 now we have to agree 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.040
 due 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.070
 wanted to show 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.640
 that makes really nice figure around the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.640
 in the back 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.670
 and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.229
 exactly 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.179
 which I find very good otherwise it has 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.480
 only works on the keyboard 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.060
 that the lever moves in front of the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.890
 moved here even before looking out to 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.890
 pedal kick I think is really great 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.560
 so moppel thank you very much for 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.849

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.610

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.420

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.420

 just behind it 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.959
 so she had to stay out 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.219
 perfect 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.370

 from the predecessor have 18 back 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.000

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:24.800
 the bmw 1800 does not revoke either 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.800

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.879

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.470
