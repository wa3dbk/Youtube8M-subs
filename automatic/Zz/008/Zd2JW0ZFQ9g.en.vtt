a dime
amount<00:02:02.010> size<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.580> this<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.420> wash<00:02:04.290> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
amount size of this on and then wash it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.680 
amount size of this on and then wash it
really<00:02:04.590> good<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.220> that's<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.300> that's<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
really good and that's it that's all I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.460 
really good and that's it that's all I
knew<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> morning<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:09.060> use

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
knew for the morning I do not use

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.110 
knew for the morning I do not use
moisturizer<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.619> much<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.460> reason<00:02:11.820> why<00:02:12.060> is

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
moisturizer that much the reason why is

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.590 
moisturizer that much the reason why is
because<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.810> feel<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.500> makes<00:02:14.160> my<00:02:14.370> he's

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
because I feel like it makes my he's

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
because I feel like it makes my he's
overly<00:02:15.600> greasy<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.950> also<00:02:18.380> break<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:19.590> from

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
overly greasy and I also break out from

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.370 
overly greasy and I also break out from
different<00:02:20.600> moisturizers<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.630> I've<00:02:21.870> used<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
different moisturizers and I've used a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.320 
different moisturizers and I've used a
lot<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.980> they<00:02:23.100> all<00:02:23.250> make<00:02:23.490> my<00:02:23.640> skin<00:02:23.940> break<00:02:24.180> out

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
lot and they all make my skin break out

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.580 
lot and they all make my skin break out
so<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.870> stay<00:02:25.080> away<00:02:25.290> from<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
so I just stay away from the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.410 
so I just stay away from the
moisturizers<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.220> let<00:02:26.640> my<00:02:26.790> skin<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.270> its

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
moisturizers and let my skin do its
