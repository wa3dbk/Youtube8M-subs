00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.670
 using a water filter 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.040
 you prolong life by 10-15 years with 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.480
 this is the quality of the days lived 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.130
 increases several times because 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.920
 most processes in the body 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 happens exactly with water and it would 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 great if this water was clean 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.030
 think your filter cleans well 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.220
 water is possible but unfortunately 90 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.250
 percent of filters differ only 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:48.219
 price and brand and virtually no 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.559
 different in technology and marketers 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.629
 only inflate the benefits of being or 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.340
 another filter to sell more 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.710
 copies want to know what is silent about 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.620
 sellers selling water filter 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.740
 You want to know why some are bad and filter 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.170
 other good great 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.100
 so let's see how to choose 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.440
 water filter 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.380
 it's pretty simple at first we have to 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.990
 throw away overvalued filters viz 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 filter which is expensive but filtered 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.020
 water is not very good to 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 figure out how much quality 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.600
 the filter matches its price you need 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
 understand all the details of filtering all 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.240
 structure of this process down to 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.270
 little things 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.320
 In short, you need to be an expert to have 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.600
 experience in this matter 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.150
 but you hardly want to understand 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.430
 all these little things right 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.860
 that's why our experts have created 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 a list of the most practical of the most 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.360
 quality water filters 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.100
 This list is ready and you can find 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.140
 Bio heat.ru 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.840
 ok so we threw away a few 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.270
 filters or revalued brands from 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.580
 Our review remained only those 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.910
 filters that match their 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.619
 quality league which quality is much 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.070
 above that is they filter the water 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.440
 better and less expensive 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.709
 what to do next now you should 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.750
 think how much I am ready 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.930
 invest your health and water quality 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.580
 which I drink because the more 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.160
 will your attachments filter 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.800
 the more clean water you drink and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.480
 so the more healthy your body will be and 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.320
 the less often you will attend 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.320
 pharmacies and hospitals 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.620
 to make it easier for you to choose 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.590
 investment size relative to quality 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.459
 filter we created a special scheme 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.980
