aspect<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.769> Cheeto<00:00:43.100> when<00:00:43.370> i<00:00:43.400> chained<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.940> my

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
aspect a Cheeto when i chained to my

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.450 
aspect a Cheeto when i chained to my
first<00:00:44.329> time<00:00:44.600> but<00:00:44.870> for<00:00:45.440> my<00:00:45.620> second<00:00:45.949> time<00:00:46.129> i<00:00:46.400> just

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
first time but for my second time i just

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.000 
first time but for my second time i just
went<00:00:47.089> without<00:00:47.239> that<00:00:47.629> because<00:00:48.020> i<00:00:48.379> figured<00:00:48.440> i

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
went without that because i figured i

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.200 
went without that because i figured i
might<00:00:49.039> as<00:00:49.309> well<00:00:49.430> spend<00:00:49.699> on<00:00:49.879> something

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
might as well spend on something

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.540 
might as well spend on something
different<00:00:50.750> because<00:00:51.350> i<00:00:51.620> was<00:00:51.739> more<00:00:51.980> experienced

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550

different because i was more experienced
in<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.789> but<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.440> easiest<00:00:54.649> one<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.250> tame<00:00:55.640> by<00:00:55.969> far

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
in it but the easiest one to tame by far

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but if you can interrupt that it helps

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
but if you can interrupt that it helps

disengage<00:04:09.810> over<00:04:10.320> him<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.709> that's<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.160> very

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
disengage over him and that's a very

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.460 
disengage over him and that's a very
risky<00:04:11.580> move<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.690> definitely<00:04:13.049> don't<00:04:13.380> want

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
risky move so you definitely don't want

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.009 
risky move so you definitely don't want
to<00:04:13.709> be<00:04:13.890> running<00:04:14.070> post<00:04:14.459> haste<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.239> just

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
to be running post haste for this just

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.469 
to be running post haste for this just
in<00:04:16.229> case<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.620> do<00:04:16.859> get<00:04:17.070> hit<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:18.000> can<00:04:18.180> still

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
in case you do get hit you can still

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.050 
in case you do get hit you can still
recover<00:04:18.750> from<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.229> days<00:04:19.410> which<00:04:20.280> will<00:04:20.519> occur

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
recover from the days which will occur

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.640 
recover from the days which will occur
if<00:04:21.299> you're<00:04:21.510> not<00:04:21.660> running<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.049> glyph<00:04:22.500> of

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
if you're not running that glyph of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.530 
if you're not running that glyph of
aspartate<00:04:23.220> chito<00:04:23.550> which<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.880> minor<00:04:24.210> glyph

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
aspartate chito which is a minor glyph

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.190 
aspartate chito which is a minor glyph
which<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.410> do<00:04:25.470> suggest<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:26.220> run<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.030> um<00:04:27.450> pretty

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
him as much as possible with keeping

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.780 
him as much as possible with keeping
your<00:04:33.360> distance<00:04:33.540> from<00:04:33.870> them<00:04:34.370> but<00:04:35.370> you're<00:04:35.520> not

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
your distance from them but you're not

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.409 
your distance from them but you're not
going<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.120> want<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.510> run<00:04:37.020> too<00:04:37.380> far<00:04:37.940> I'll<00:04:38.940> show

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
going to want to run too far I'll show

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.620 
going to want to run too far I'll show
you<00:04:39.930> what<00:04:40.349> you<00:04:40.470> don't<00:04:40.710> want<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:41.039> hear

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
but when you bring them around the

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.640 
but when you bring them around the
corner<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.300> do<00:04:45.449> not<00:04:45.569> want<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.960> run<00:04:46.139> too<00:04:46.410> fast

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
corner you do not want to run too fast

corner you do not want to run too fast
around<00:04:47.210> otherwise<00:04:48.210> he<00:04:48.569> will<00:04:48.660> just<00:04:48.870> run<00:04:49.169> over

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
around otherwise he will just run over

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.680 
around otherwise he will just run over
the<00:04:49.650> hump<00:04:49.889> of<00:04:50.069> the<00:04:50.370> mountain<00:04:50.789> and<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.120> will

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
the hump of the mountain and you will

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.629 
the hump of the mountain and you will
see<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:51.960> i<00:04:52.289> will<00:04:52.560> miss<00:04:52.740> every<00:04:53.099> single<00:04:53.400> trap

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
see that i will miss every single trap

see that i will miss every single trap
that<00:04:53.669> i<00:04:53.910> had<00:04:54.120> planned<00:04:54.360> for<00:04:54.569> him<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.169> i<00:04:55.680> do<00:04:55.740> to

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
you don't want to do that real quick and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.379 
you don't want to do that real quick and
pretty<00:05:03.000> much<00:05:03.120> just<00:05:03.830> what<00:05:04.830> not<00:05:05.039> to<00:05:05.069> do<00:05:05.370> here<00:05:05.699> you

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
pretty much just what not to do here you

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.270 
pretty much just what not to do here you
know<00:05:06.569> I<00:05:06.599> still<00:05:06.780> do<00:05:07.259> manage<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.710> get<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.069> team

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
know I still do manage to get the team

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.309 
know I still do manage to get the team
because<00:05:09.000> all<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.389> have<00:05:09.509> to<00:05:09.599> do<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:09.810> disengage

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
because all you have to do is disengage

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.710 
because all you have to do is disengage
as<00:05:10.889> you<00:05:11.069> see<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.280> put<00:05:11.580> down<00:05:11.729> my<00:05:11.789> traps<00:05:12.180> there<00:05:12.479> and

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
as you see I put down my traps there and

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.570 
as you see I put down my traps there and
then<00:05:13.050> he's<00:05:13.319> just<00:05:13.440> gonna<00:05:13.740> walk<00:05:13.949> over<00:05:13.979> that<00:05:14.370> hill

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
then he's just gonna walk over that hill

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.180 
then he's just gonna walk over that hill
if<00:05:14.819> because<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.330> went<00:05:15.750> too<00:05:15.900> fast<00:05:16.110> you<00:05:16.919> have<00:05:17.039> to

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
if because I went too fast you have to

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.670 
if because I went too fast you have to
keep<00:05:17.400> up<00:05:17.610> with<00:05:17.639> uh<00:05:18.090> just<00:05:18.840> slow<00:05:19.199> down<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.440> little

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
keep up with uh just slow down a little

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.950 
keep up with uh just slow down a little
bit<00:05:19.860> he<00:05:20.520> was<00:05:20.639> safe<00:05:20.940> from<00:05:21.180> because<00:05:21.750> of<00:05:21.870> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
bit he was safe from because of the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.589 
bit he was safe from because of the
binding<00:05:22.349> shot<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.889> as<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.729> see<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.449> get

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
binding shot and as you see you get

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.270 
binding shot and as you see you get
stuck<00:05:24.900> there<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:25.409> can<00:05:25.560> add<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.770> disengage

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
stuck there so you can add to disengage

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.089 
stuck there so you can add to disengage
over<00:05:26.639> them<00:05:26.759> and<00:05:26.970> then<00:05:27.479> you're<00:05:27.659> just<00:05:27.690> fine<00:05:28.110> to

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
over them and then you're just fine to

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.909 
over them and then you're just fine to
tame<00:05:29.639> them<00:05:29.849> once<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.389> get<00:05:31.259> a<00:05:31.289> safe<00:05:31.710> distance

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
tame them once you get a safe distance

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.640 
tame them once you get a safe distance
way<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.580> reapply<00:05:33.060> your<00:05:33.090> expressive<00:05:33.690> I'm<00:05:34.409> just

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
way and reapply your expressive I'm just

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.469 
way and reapply your expressive I'm just
gonna<00:05:34.830> get<00:05:35.039> behind<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:35.520> trap<00:05:35.880> real<00:05:36.060> quick<00:05:36.300> so

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
gonna get behind this trap real quick so

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.260 
gonna get behind this trap real quick so
it<00:05:36.599> slows<00:05:36.870> them<00:05:37.169> but<00:05:37.889> um<00:05:38.190> you're<00:05:38.909> only<00:05:39.090> going

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
it slows them but um you're only going

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.330 
it slows them but um you're only going
to<00:05:39.330> take<00:05:39.419> one<00:05:39.569> or<00:05:39.960> two<00:05:39.990> hits<00:05:40.319> from<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.830> you

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
to take one or two hits from and you

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.580 
to take one or two hits from and you
should<00:05:41.550> survive<00:05:41.909> it<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:42.300> then<00:05:43.080> you'll<00:05:43.349> have

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
should survive it and then you'll have

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.700 
should survive it and then you'll have
him<00:05:44.030> that's<00:05:45.030> pretty<00:05:45.330> much<00:05:45.479> all<00:05:45.719> that<00:05:46.229> comes<00:05:46.500> to

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
him that's pretty much all that comes to

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.129 
him that's pretty much all that comes to
with<00:05:46.889> that<00:05:47.070> guy<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.550> then<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.449> red<00:05:48.659> one<00:05:48.900> I'll

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
with that guy and then the red one I'll

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.480 
with that guy and then the red one I'll
show<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.680> route<00:05:49.860> for<00:05:50.099> him<00:05:50.219> real<00:05:50.370> quick

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
show you the route for him real quick

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.700 
show you the route for him real quick
you<00:05:51.120> have<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.360> be<00:05:51.599> very<00:05:51.630> careful<00:05:52.139> for<00:05:52.530> with

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
you have to be very careful for with
