give you a quick look at a brand new

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.240 
give you a quick look at a brand new
game<00:00:08.870> that<00:00:08.929> came<00:00:09.110> out<00:00:09.380> called<00:00:09.650> descent

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
game that came out called descent

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.820 
game that came out called descent
retails<00:00:11.120> for<00:00:11.210> 99<00:00:11.750> cents<00:00:12.170> in<00:00:12.260> the<00:00:12.349> marketplace

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
retails for 99 cents in the marketplace

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.980 
retails for 99 cents in the marketplace
and<00:00:13.070> there<00:00:13.400> is<00:00:13.550> a<00:00:13.580> try<00:00:14.120> before<00:00:14.180> you<00:00:14.510> buy<00:00:14.599> with

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
and there is a try before you buy with

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.890 
and there is a try before you buy with
it<00:00:15.019> I<00:00:15.349> think<00:00:16.189> this<00:00:16.340> games<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:16.789> probably<00:00:17.359> be<00:00:17.630> a

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
it I think this games can probably be a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.460 
it I think this games can probably be a
huge<00:00:18.529> hit<00:00:18.769> and<00:00:18.949> I'll<00:00:19.339> show<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:19.579> why<00:00:20.140> it's<00:00:21.140> very

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
huge hit and I'll show you why it's very

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.019 
huge hit and I'll show you why it's very
exciting<00:00:21.800> gameplay<00:00:22.009> it's<00:00:22.579> actually<00:00:22.909> pretty

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
exciting gameplay it's actually pretty

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.679 
exciting gameplay it's actually pretty
challenging<00:00:23.739> and<00:00:24.739> it's<00:00:24.859> definitely<00:00:25.189> unique

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
challenging and it's definitely unique

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.779 
challenging and it's definitely unique
just<00:00:26.689> really<00:00:27.079> cool<00:00:27.230> graphics<00:00:27.769> it's<00:00:28.339> basically

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
just really cool graphics it's basically

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.120 
just really cool graphics it's basically
a<00:00:29.060> straight<00:00:29.449> up<00:00:29.479> racing<00:00:29.810> game<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.769> you<00:00:30.919> have

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
a straight up racing game and you have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.010 
a straight up racing game and you have
to<00:00:31.310> collect<00:00:31.609> energy<00:00:31.849> points<00:00:32.570> in<00:00:32.720> order<00:00:32.870> to

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
to collect energy points in order to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.080 
to collect energy points in order to
keep<00:00:33.170> going<00:00:33.590> meanwhile<00:00:34.460> there's<00:00:34.700> things<00:00:34.970> to

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
keep going meanwhile there's things to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.740 
keep going meanwhile there's things to
dodge<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.840> it's<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.440> very<00:00:37.060> trippy<00:00:38.060> adventure

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
dodge and it's a very trippy adventure

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.340 
dodge and it's a very trippy adventure
to<00:00:38.990> say<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.200> least<00:00:39.320> but<00:00:39.770> let's<00:00:39.920> take<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.130> look

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
to say the least but let's take a look

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.660 
to say the least but let's take a look
so<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:42.500> is<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.950> game<00:00:43.130> is<00:00:43.280> controlled

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
so this is it the game is controlled

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.930 
so this is it the game is controlled
completely<00:00:43.880> by<00:00:44.060> the<00:00:44.180> accelerometer<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.940> you

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
completely by the accelerometer and you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.420 
completely by the accelerometer and you
just<00:00:47.150> are<00:00:47.390> racing<00:00:47.870> through<00:00:47.930> this<00:00:48.800> massive

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
just are racing through this massive

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.820 
just are racing through this massive
tunnel<00:00:49.760> as<00:00:50.080> you<00:00:51.080> can<00:00:51.140> see<00:00:51.290> when<00:00:51.470> I<00:00:51.500> hit<00:00:51.650> those

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
tunnel as you can see when I hit those

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.980 
tunnel as you can see when I hit those
black<00:00:52.040> things<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.550> slow<00:00:52.940> down<00:00:52.970> so<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:53.780> want<00:00:53.930> to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
black things I slow down so you want to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.430 
black things I slow down so you want to
try<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.170> avoid<00:00:54.410> those<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.970> blue<00:00:56.210> balls<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
try to avoid those the blue balls the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.720 
try to avoid those the blue balls the
orbs<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:59.410> speed<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:00.530> up<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:01.010> red<00:01:01.190> ones<00:01:01.400> give

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
orbs I speed you up the red ones give

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.119 
orbs I speed you up the red ones give
you<00:01:01.820> more<00:01:01.970> energy<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.420> keep<00:01:02.570> going<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:03.680> you

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
you more energy to keep going so you

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.340 
you more energy to keep going so you
need<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> maintain<00:01:05.150> your<00:01:05.239> energy<00:01:05.570> level<00:01:05.840> or<00:01:06.200> to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
need a maintain your energy level or to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.700 
need a maintain your energy level or to
keep<00:01:06.500> going<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.979> game<00:01:08.259> there<00:01:09.259> we<00:01:09.380> go<00:01:09.560> we

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
keep going in the game there we go we

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.219 
keep going in the game there we go we
got<00:01:09.890> keep<00:01:10.159> bouncing<00:01:10.520> around<00:01:10.609> here<00:01:13.929> it's<00:01:14.929> very

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
got keep bouncing around here it's very

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.230 
got keep bouncing around here it's very
challenging<00:01:15.469> it<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.399> can<00:01:16.549> keep<00:01:17.179> hitting

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
challenging it so you can keep hitting

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.550 
challenging it so you can keep hitting
things<00:01:17.569> this<00:01:17.719> movie<00:01:17.990> won<00:01:18.109> those<00:01:18.200> games<00:01:18.319> we're

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
things this movie won those games we're

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.870 
things this movie won those games we're
going<00:01:18.679> we<00:01:18.740> have<00:01:18.889> to<00:01:19.009> build<00:01:19.130> up<00:01:19.249> skills<00:01:19.609> and<00:01:19.850> I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
going we have to build up skills and I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.580 
going we have to build up skills and I
can<00:01:20.030> see<00:01:20.179> people<00:01:20.810> going<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:20.990> get<00:01:21.079> very<00:01:21.109> good<00:01:21.469> at

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
can see people going to get very good at

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.559 
can see people going to get very good at
this<00:01:21.829> I<00:01:22.100> might<00:01:22.670> not<00:01:22.789> be<00:01:22.939> one<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.179> those<00:01:23.270> people

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
this I might not be one of those people

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.620 
this I might not be one of those people
but<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.840> really<00:01:24.200> enjoy<00:01:24.350> playing<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:24.979> far<00:01:25.219> as

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
but I really enjoy playing it so far as

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.059 
but I really enjoy playing it so far as
you<00:01:26.630> go<00:01:26.749> further<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.170> further<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.590> levels<00:01:27.889> do

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
you go further and further the levels do

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.010 
you go further and further the levels do
change<00:01:28.429> color<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.240> backgrounds<00:01:29.749> change

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
change color and the backgrounds change

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.469 
change color and the backgrounds change
to<00:01:30.799> let<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.039> know<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:31.490> can<00:01:32.149> progress

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
to let you know that you can progress

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.969 
to let you know that you can progress
obviously<00:01:33.109> i'm<00:01:33.229> not<00:01:33.289> going<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.590> probably<00:01:33.770> do

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
obviously i'm not going to probably do

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.620 
obviously i'm not going to probably do
that<00:01:34.100> i<00:01:34.280> keep<00:01:34.399> hitting<00:01:34.579> everything<00:01:34.909> oh<00:01:35.209> this

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
that i keep hitting everything oh this

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.349 
that i keep hitting everything oh this
is<00:01:35.780> very<00:01:36.049> difficult<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.590> play<00:01:36.799> while<00:01:37.240> doing<00:01:38.240> a

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
is very difficult to play while doing a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.440 
is very difficult to play while doing a
video<00:01:39.340> let's<00:01:40.340> say<00:01:40.520> there<00:01:40.670> we<00:01:40.789> go<00:01:41.920> maybe<00:01:42.920> time

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
video let's say there we go maybe time

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.690 
video let's say there we go maybe time
anyways<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.319> basically<00:01:45.859> yet<00:01:46.069> I<00:01:46.100> highly

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
anyways this is basically yet I highly

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.699 
anyways this is basically yet I highly
recommend<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.179> give<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.719> a<00:01:47.810> try<00:01:48.049> because<00:01:48.380> it's

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
recommend you give it a try because it's

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.559 
recommend you give it a try because it's
kind<00:01:49.249> of<00:01:49.310> very<00:01:49.459> exciting<00:01:50.149> there<00:01:50.359> we<00:01:50.450> go

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
kind of very exciting there we go

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.399 
kind of very exciting there we go
there's<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.869> new<00:01:51.020> background<00:01:52.299> and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
there's a new background and

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.629
