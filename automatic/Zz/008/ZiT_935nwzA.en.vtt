00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.120
 today we present the team sc 021 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.790
 this is a module for access control 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.490
 of the ambi brand this team is going to 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.430
 be able to control two teams 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.130
 for access control a button and a 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.859
 electromagnetic sheet through a 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.470
 I just system this through the 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.079
 interconnection of the two teams of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.029
 utp cable access control towards 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:32.150
 two terminals can also be done 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.700
 by cable connection pod 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.230
 in the case of the button is a button 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 simple that is also connected in the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.980
 top left and we have a 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.250
 electromagnetic sheet that in this case 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.480
 is 150 pounds of pressure this 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.160
 connection will allow the thought in 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.470
 first instance is to interconnect already 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.050
 say a single system an example of this 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.960
 is to have an entry system and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.840
 an outlet for control of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.090
 the entrances or exits of our 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.740
 personal and in due case if we do not want 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.810
 have control only of the 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.160
 people who come and go but 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.590
 only of the staff that can 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.290
 visit us we have a simple button 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.300
 to be able to open 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.070
 this connection will also allow us 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.890
 define if we want to do it through 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.220
 a buoy our veneer through a 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.220
 fingerprint 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.210
 for a card 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.280
 or by an identification code 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.050
 ah 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.900
 if due to the case you want to use 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.210
 another fingerprint will not allow us 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.590
 open in none of the teams was 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.630
 even a card that is not the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.340
 adequate 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.930
 and the button may be using 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.930
 to open at any time 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.430
 and 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 Thank you
