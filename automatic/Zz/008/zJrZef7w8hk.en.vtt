00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 summer heat as you want to drink a sip 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.980
 cold waters but i'm not talking about that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.469
 I thought and how the world is this water 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.109
 quick quick well how can 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:19.560
 quicker cool can i take clean 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.160
 rag towel or you can even take 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.170
 paper 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 moisten some water wet and wrapping 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:35.820
 your water bottle with this rag and then 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.309
 I'm probably making a cellophane bag 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 and put as you understand, I put 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 this kind of freezer and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.579
 literally through well of course I will support 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.890
 maximum time well at least 5-10 minutes 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.550
 need to support get 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.580
 freezer this water bag ice 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.369
 and the water will be cool and pretty if 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.409
 longer hold just be cold 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.430
 That if I thought in advance 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.890
 I made ice in my fridge 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.600
 here are the ice cubes due came came 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.780
 some water 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.900
 took the tank definitely so the bottle 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.409
 My entered this capacity I pour here 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.369
 plain water from a tap well naturally 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.040
 cold preferably not hot and this 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 which I cooked it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 I pour out all the ice 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.009
 better for the process to go 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.829
 I'll add a little more salt 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:54.229
 ordinary salt to go down 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:57.049
 ice water bottle and trust me 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.030
 the water becomes very fast 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.270
 cold it is already possible to drink it and us 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.880
 the bullet path is nice and here 's the most 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.250
 good way in my opinion if again 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 I thought beforehand what should 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.840
 I had to think in advance should 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:20.190
 think in advance to put in the freezer 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.760
 water chamber but preliminary estimate 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.799
 somewhere with a floor of a bottle of water 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.440
 cast and in a recumbent floor like me 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.910
 say or even so here lizun so 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.670
 that the neck is not closed by ice so 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.760
 eat semi prone i must 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.500
 this bottle of water is frozen in this 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.810
 half 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.769
 Here, too, I did in advance if you 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.859
 you can see here a piece of ice in the bottle 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.190
 this is the most good way why 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.989
 because here me is warm water i 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.760
 I open this bottle I take out 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.910
 freezer that is, I thought in advance 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.060
 about having me so 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.000
 billet pouring some water here 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.090
 warm water and this is a piece of ice there is a hoist 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.540
 clean good water pour water here 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:22.519
 and believe me that this water is lukewarm 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:26.130
 it is already possible to drink it is cooled instantly 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.420
 see this ice it dissolves quickly in 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.639
 This jester poured 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.090
 and she was already drinking cold water 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:35.880
 good way i wish you and the most 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.160
 quickest way to cool water only 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.630
 you need to prepare a couple of these in advance 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.900
 bottles and put in the freezer 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.049
 camera i wish you a good summer hot 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.870
 days 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.850
 health as always girls and boys 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.850
