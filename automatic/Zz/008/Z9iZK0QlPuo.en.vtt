alright guys Taren here and we're going
to<00:00:04.160> show<00:00:04.340> you<00:00:04.399> how<00:00:04.550> to<00:00:04.609> upgrade<00:00:04.940> the<00:00:05.359> RAM<00:00:06.350> on

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
to show you how to upgrade the RAM on

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.100 
to show you how to upgrade the RAM on
your<00:00:06.920> vintage<00:00:07.549> graded<00:00:07.910> video<00:00:08.120> card<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:08.719> in

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
your vintage graded video card so in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.209 
your vintage graded video card so in
order<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:09.350> get<00:00:09.469> to<00:00:09.530> my<00:00:09.619> BIOS<00:00:09.920> I<00:00:10.010> could<00:00:10.129> hit

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
order to get to my BIOS I could hit

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.840 
order to get to my BIOS I could hit
delete<00:00:10.610> it's<00:00:10.820> either<00:00:10.969> delete<00:00:11.360> f12<00:00:12.170> f11<00:00:12.799> f10<00:00:13.219> f2

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:13.850 
delete it's either delete f12 f11 f10 f2

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.830 
delete it's either delete f12 f11 f10 f2
or<00:00:14.360> f1<00:00:14.900> depends<00:00:15.619> on<00:00:15.740> your<00:00:15.949> motherboard<00:00:16.670> so<00:00:17.390> I'm

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
or f1 depends on your motherboard so I'm

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.630 
or f1 depends on your motherboard so I'm
getting<00:00:18.260> some<00:00:18.500> weird<00:00:18.650> error<00:00:19.040> here<00:00:19.370> so<00:00:19.550> I'm

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
getting some weird error here so I'm

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.030 
getting some weird error here so I'm
just<00:00:19.790> gonna<00:00:19.910> run<00:00:20.270> setup<00:00:20.990> there<00:00:21.260> we<00:00:21.380> go<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:21.980> now

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
just gonna run setup there we go so now

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.760 
just gonna run setup there we go so now
I'm<00:00:22.190> in<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.340> BIOS<00:00:23.050> that<00:00:24.050> error<00:00:24.289> was<00:00:24.500> because

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
I'm in the BIOS that error was because

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.970 
I'm in the BIOS that error was because
my<00:00:24.890> battery<00:00:25.310> died<00:00:25.490> on<00:00:25.640> my<00:00:25.730> motherboard<00:00:25.970> ok<00:00:26.869> so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
my battery died on my motherboard ok so

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.189 
my battery died on my motherboard ok so
we're<00:00:27.980> going<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:28.160> do<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.640> bump<00:00:29.030> up<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:29.630> onboard

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
we're going to do to bump up the onboard

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.729 
we're going to do to bump up the onboard
video<00:00:30.530> you're<00:00:31.039> going<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.220> go<00:00:31.340> to<00:00:31.369> chipset

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
video you're going to go to chipset

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.640 
video you're going to go to chipset
Southbridge<00:00:33.739> configuration<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:35.650> right

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
Southbridge configuration and right

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.639 
Southbridge configuration and right
there<00:00:37.250> okay<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:37.820> VGA<00:00:38.360> frame<00:00:38.960> buffer<00:00:39.380> size

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
there okay so VGA frame buffer size

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.620 
there okay so VGA frame buffer size
could<00:00:40.280> be<00:00:40.310> different<00:00:40.820> things<00:00:41.090> like<00:00:41.270> that<00:00:41.450> like

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
could be different things like that like

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.520 
could be different things like that like
video<00:00:41.930> card<00:00:42.230> memory<00:00:42.470> or<00:00:43.390> graphics<00:00:44.390> card<00:00:44.530> Ram

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
video card memory or graphics card Ram

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.330 
video card memory or graphics card Ram
could<00:00:46.130> be<00:00:46.790> labeled<00:00:47.180> pretty<00:00:47.390> much<00:00:47.540> anything<00:00:47.780> so

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
could be labeled pretty much anything so

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.830 
could be labeled pretty much anything so
right<00:00:49.340> now<00:00:49.550> am<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:49.940> in<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.120> highest<00:00:50.450> I<00:00:50.570> am<00:00:50.690> on

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
right now am I in the highest I am on

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.299 
right now am I in the highest I am on
the<00:00:50.899> highest<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:51.470> it's<00:00:51.710> probably<00:00:52.070> going<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.219> be

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
the highest so it's probably going to be

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.610 
the highest so it's probably going to be
set<00:00:52.520> to<00:00:52.640> auto<00:00:52.850> or<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.750> lowest<00:00:53.960> setting<00:00:54.469> it's

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
set to auto or the lowest setting it's

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.200 
set to auto or the lowest setting it's
usually<00:00:54.800> what<00:00:55.130> they're<00:00:55.250> set<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.520> now<00:00:56.090> on

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
usually what they're set to now on

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.900 
usually what they're set to now on
laptops<00:00:56.840> this<00:00:57.079> is<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.260> good<00:00:57.620> freaking<00:00:58.340> idea

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
laptops this is a good freaking idea

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.420 
laptops this is a good freaking idea
upgrade<00:00:59.660> your<00:00:59.870> RAM<00:01:00.020> in<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.290> laptop<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.010> then

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
upgrade your RAM in the laptop and then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.069 
upgrade your RAM in the laptop and then
bump<00:01:01.670> your<00:01:01.879> video<00:01:02.090> card<00:01:02.420> Ram<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.870> going<00:01:02.930> to

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
bump your video card Ram is going to

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.620 
bump your video card Ram is going to
make<00:01:03.200> all<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.590> difference<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.070> world

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
make all the difference in the world

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.510 
make all the difference in the world
unfortunately<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.499> laptop<00:01:06.709> you<00:01:07.249> cannot

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
unfortunately in a laptop you cannot

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.730 
unfortunately in a laptop you cannot
change<00:01:07.789> out<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.240> hardware<00:01:08.359> that<00:01:08.659> easily<00:01:09.380> so

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
change out the hardware that easily so

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.919 
change out the hardware that easily so
this<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.310> your<00:01:10.459> best<00:01:10.670> option<00:01:10.999> and<00:01:11.359> basically

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
this is your best option and basically

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:12.849 
this is your best option and basically
your<00:01:12.109> only<00:01:12.259> option

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
your only option

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.789 
your only option
so<00:01:13.340> if<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:14.539> option<00:01:15.049> is<00:01:15.170> available<00:01:15.289> on<00:01:15.709> your

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
so if this option is available on your

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.309 
so if this option is available on your
motherboard<00:01:16.069> crank<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:16.969> up<00:01:17.090> now<00:01:17.420> having<00:01:18.109> said

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
motherboard crank it up now having said

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.760 
motherboard crank it up now having said
that<00:01:18.350> if<00:01:18.740> my<00:01:19.279> computer<00:01:19.520> only<00:01:20.090> has<00:01:20.770> 256

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
that if my computer only has 256

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.489 
that if my computer only has 256
megabytes<00:01:21.979> RAM<00:01:22.459> in<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.880> period<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:24.109> is<00:01:24.350> not

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
megabytes RAM in it period this is not

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.919 
megabytes RAM in it period this is not
going<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.799> work<00:01:24.979> ok<00:01:25.609> so<00:01:26.359> if<00:01:26.479> you're<00:01:26.630> looking<00:01:26.719> at

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
going to work ok so if you're looking at

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.239 
going to work ok so if you're looking at
small<00:01:27.229> amounts<00:01:27.499> of<00:01:27.590> RAM<00:01:27.709> you<00:01:27.889> really<00:01:28.069> have<00:01:28.159> to

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
small amounts of RAM you really have to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:29.830 
small amounts of RAM you really have to
do<00:01:28.340> your<00:01:28.369> calculations<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.539> don't<00:01:29.659> want<00:01:29.779> to

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
do your calculations you don't want to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.629 
do your calculations you don't want to
be<00:01:29.929> more<00:01:30.109> than<00:01:30.229> half<00:01:30.469> or<00:01:30.859> even<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.249> quarter

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:31.639 
be more than half or even a quarter

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.010 
be more than half or even a quarter
really<00:01:31.789> if<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.270> RAM<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.659> got<00:01:32.779> for<00:01:32.929> your

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
really if the RAM you got for your

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.559 
really if the RAM you got for your
system<00:01:33.349> on<00:01:33.529> your<00:01:33.740> video<00:01:33.920> card<00:01:34.219> if<00:01:35.209> I<00:01:35.359> were<00:01:35.479> to

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
system on your video card if I were to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.359 
system on your video card if I were to
boot<00:01:35.749> it<00:01:35.840> like<00:01:35.959> this<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.409> nowhere<00:01:37.009> ends<00:01:37.159> up

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
boot it like this and nowhere ends up

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.440 
boot it like this and nowhere ends up
for<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.609> system<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.029> whole<00:01:38.179> thing<00:01:38.329> would

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
for the system the whole thing would

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.969 
for the system the whole thing would
just<00:01:38.479> boot<00:01:38.749> up<00:01:38.869> black<00:01:39.109> get<00:01:39.499> up<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.679> pot<00:01:39.859> your

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
just boot up black get up the pot your

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.010 
just boot up black get up the pot your
battery<00:01:40.279> and<00:01:40.520> reset<00:01:41.179> all<00:01:41.209> your<00:01:41.420> settings<00:01:41.599> so

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
battery and reset all your settings so

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.779 
battery and reset all your settings so
so<00:01:42.409> I'm<00:01:42.469> going<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.679> crank<00:01:42.889> it<00:01:43.009> way<00:01:43.279> up<00:01:43.310> other

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
so I'm going to crank it way up other

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
now there is a million ways to get into

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.919 
now there is a million ways to get into
BIOS<00:02:01.700> there's<00:02:01.999> million<00:02:02.270> different<00:02:02.569> biases

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
BIOS there's million different biases

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.419 
BIOS there's million different biases
and<00:02:03.049> million<00:02:03.289> versions<00:02:03.649> of<00:02:03.770> BIOS<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.249> there's

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
and million versions of BIOS so there's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.679 
and million versions of BIOS so there's
a<00:02:04.459> million<00:02:04.609> million<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.149> Google

a million million to Google

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.229 
a million million to Google
okay<00:02:05.959> just<00:02:06.200> google<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.739> ok<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.759> if<00:02:07.909> you<00:02:07.939> can't
