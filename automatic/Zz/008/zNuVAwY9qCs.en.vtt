00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.970
 in the city of new york we are elective says my smile transparent 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.920
 so for 100 euros had again created the event with the wood of jospeh 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.039
 been tonight the most applauded game 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.619
 while the game had already been presenting it were you waiting 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.759
 still such a welcome 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.460
 it was hoped that the game was as appreciated as it could have been 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.299
 know the May 3 a year wrote the president returns to see that fifty man 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 the game work well and lines new things that we showed 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.400
 it is 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 summer for lover% 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 by expected but she was really new and it was good 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.530
 so you talked about including bug strategy except on psp string 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.710
 4 bringing 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.740
 the same game on for all screens helene experience that the the player is going 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.250
 to be able to live to it does go up a little bit to detail this of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.549
 philosophy yes the idea is of the power to have games that are 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.609
 those who are alive who continue to live on for weeks of months 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.810
 even years and the opportunity to play of course in the living room 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.250
 but to be able to continue playing with his phone with his tablet with 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.830
 his pc 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.070
 from the outside 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.200
 So suddenly, to be constantly connected to the game 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 to receive they were sending inputs that allows you to continue playing or 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 to continue to know what is happening in the world to be able to intervene 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.800
 last year the floor I feel that you have in the present who do I see of 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.220
 bull had announced on playstation 3 and xbox 360 probably not to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.009
 unveil the new generation 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.149
 of consoles before it is made by the builders is this 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.310
 that the game really listens is still planned on ps3 and xbox 360 or is it 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.750
 we can say today that I really dosed a game but I like 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.330
 and well first of all to me I store knowama is an Annecy game we had 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.830
 also announced the reality this is last year 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.650
 which was% for us a way to really work tells pictures and 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.480
 animations that were not yet possible on ps3 360 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 and so the idea here above all to do something that is going to be 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.649
 who will use all the capabilities of the new machines and then 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.199
 tunisia all in euros to help them 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:17.259
 pass them in in a ps3 ine 3 60 okay so that will come out of course 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.249
 screens on the current ones as well what 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.039
 the goal is to actually succeed in optimizing enough to be able to 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.699
 make the master on his machines the last question how much agreement 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.439
 games at home on his development for the sweet de chine 4 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.950
 in the end it's hard to answer because human links 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.709
 there are many 1 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 I would say we have 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.859
 the retreat 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 fifteen young people who pursue their genre and in development 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.629
 we still have beautiful things to see 3 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.979
 so everything will not be shown to us 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.139
 go to 2 3 thank you very much and thank you very much
