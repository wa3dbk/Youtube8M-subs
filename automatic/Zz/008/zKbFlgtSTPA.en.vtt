00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.240
 like the other time friends friends of 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.330
 youtube welcome to this sixth installment 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.650
 of the saga of origami or video 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.210
 tutorial is the see that I try 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.240
 teach how to make origami from the most 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.500
 basic until the most complicated this time 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.539
 let's access one of the most important figures 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.730
 emblematic of origami or 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.300
 origami as you want to call the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.820
 bow tie 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 and good to do it we will start from a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.970
 perfect square you know how it's done 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.220
 and what we will do will be first 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 perform a a valley fold here is 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.140
 say from this point to this 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.710
 doing this I already had it marked because 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.110
 you know how this square is made 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 explained in previous videotutorials 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.040
 we open we take from this point to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.309
 is dividing here with another fold of 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.309
 Valley 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.280
 perfect 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 we open 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.810
 and we turn it around 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.180
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.110
 divide here in the middle of this side 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 up this side 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.310
 that is accurate you already know if it is not 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 now an ugly bow tie 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550
 the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 we open and from this side to this 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.530
 side 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.280
 today 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.130
 once done this we open we have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.950
 the divisions this this point here 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.770
 would be the center of the square we are going to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.860
 direct all the tips this some 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.590
 is some this point and this tip at 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.250
 center doing such that these point 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.250
 to the center 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.569
 you see it 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.200
 a little advice 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.220
 if you look at this line here 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.130
 that is, this fold 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.590
 what goods is this 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.530
 when putting it in the center matches 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.870
 this is another help that you can have 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.720
 besides this side coincides with this and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.330
 this with this so there is no loss 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.290
 It has to come out perfect and we do it 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.290
 with the four sides 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.550
 we already have it 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.980
 Once this is done, we turn it over and 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.410
 we repeat it this continues well follows 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.520
 being the center yes that we go from this 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.520
 point to the center 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.640
 no more complication is a figure 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.640
 very simple 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.470
 today 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.720
 perfect 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.590
 we do not have a right this does not 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.590
 we unfold everything 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.000
 bye 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.859
 when we have everything deployed you see 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.130
 that the folds tend to one side 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:22.850
 you see that these go mountain 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.260
 and these mountain valleys go mountain 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.080
 they should look down like this 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.060
 and what we are going to do is these 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.490
 triangles cloaks limited by pleats 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.889
 mountain right now 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.240
 they have to go to the center that is to say that 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.870
 we will double this 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.870
 A) Yes 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.060
 you do not see no 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.630
 towards the center like this 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.470
 this also makes the center but leaving 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.889
 this out 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.560
 if you notice this is in the center 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.830
 well, over here 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.470
 it will go like this 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.300
 and this to the center 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.760
 we turn and do the same 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.960
 with this 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.960
 this like this and this towards the center 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.270
 and this to the brain 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.840
 because we would stay this kind 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.840
 of the mill 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.860
 it is appreciated not 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.430
 once this is done, the only thing we have 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.840
 that make those fijÃ¡is a reality so that 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.110
 you see it more clearly in case you have not 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.080
 still aware with the lists is this or 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.380
 it is square to bend inside it comes to us 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.530
 more once this is done the grinder this one 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.400
 what we will do is turn it around and 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.520
 this line here 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.620
 that divides this this square 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.629
 in this half what we will do 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.940
 fold it in with a fold of 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.480
 valley doing this 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.480
 A) Yes 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:21.069
 and we will have a fantastic piranha 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.680
 and what we will do will be out of this 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.409
 this one is lace 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.080
 download them and 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:31.749
 that are going to be the legs of the bow tie 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.189
 tail and head legs that we will now 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.849
 what we have to do to make the 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:40.760
 head is to open this up slightly and 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:43.730
 is this part of this line 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.360
 and on this side also do it towards 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.830
 forward is to say turn around as 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.110
 we would do so 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.110
 You see, it comes out practically 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.150
 and we already have our bow tie 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.150
 paper 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:06.600
 Let's see 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.120
 recommendations that I do not use you 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.250
 big paper do not do this I've done 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.080
 with a two to teach you but you 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.400
 I recommend pretty little paper sheets 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.169
 little girls 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.730
 if you have but with a two also we 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.430
 is going to leave or is going to leave the same but 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.919
 is much prettier with small paper 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.990
 because you also have better standing the 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.060
 structure is more rigid and it's fine 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.010
 but you already see it is a 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.990
 bow tie that resonated with its two legs and 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.540
 its peak and it's one of the most 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.070
 classic origami that practically 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.680
 dictated at the beginning of everything you have to 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.419
 Knowing how to do this is a bit more complex 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.180
 and I do not know if you will understand me well in the 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:46.260
 video but good I hope so 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.330
 how good you already know how to share and 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.930
 all that and see you in the next 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.800
 delivery 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.800
 Thanks for seeing me
