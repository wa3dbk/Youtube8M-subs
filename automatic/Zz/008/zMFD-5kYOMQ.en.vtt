00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.010 
little better now available fault in 12
and<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> art<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.969> was<00:01:36.060> done<00:01:36.299> by<00:01:36.509> some

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and so this is art that was done by some

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
and so this is art that was done by some
guy<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:37.469> sent<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.819> was<00:01:38.939> some<00:01:39.030> kind

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
