spring skiing basically we're dealing
with<00:00:23.910> another<00:00:24.910> one<00:00:25.150> of<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.360> elements<00:00:26.279> that's

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
with another one of the elements that's

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.290 
with another one of the elements that's
underneath<00:00:28.750> our<00:00:29.020> board<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.820> spring

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
underneath our board and in the spring

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.640 
underneath our board and in the spring
you<00:00:31.449> have<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.600> lot<00:00:31.779> of<00:00:31.810> pollens<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:32.529> are

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
you have a lot of pollens that are

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.119 
you have a lot of pollens that are
blowing<00:00:32.860> onto<00:00:33.129> the<00:00:33.400> snow<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.739> pollen

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
blowing onto the snow and the pollen

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.880 
blowing onto the snow and the pollen
just<00:00:36.309> happens<00:00:36.580> to<00:00:36.670> be<00:00:36.760> wax<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:38.170> unfortunately

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
just happens to be wax but unfortunately

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.189 
just happens to be wax but unfortunately
it's<00:00:39.040> sticky<00:00:39.519> so<00:00:39.790> we<00:00:40.120> had<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.510> address<00:00:40.900> that

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
it's sticky so we had to address that

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's sticky so we had to address that
and<00:00:41.699> I<00:00:42.699> did<00:00:43.540> that<00:00:43.750> I<00:00:44.320> took<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.890> Racing<00:00:45.280> 739<00:00:46.089> and

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
and I did that I took the Racing 739 and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.240 
and I did that I took the Racing 739 and
I<00:00:46.479> formulated<00:00:47.049> a<00:00:47.229> special<00:00:47.650> product<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.159> that

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
I formulated a special product and that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.740 
I formulated a special product and that
it<00:00:48.400> takes<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.820> pollen<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.269> it<00:00:49.360> makes<00:00:49.570> it

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
it takes the pollen and it makes it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.869 
it takes the pollen and it makes it
slick<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.769> so<00:00:51.040> now<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.519> a<00:00:51.549> wonderful

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
slick and so now you have a wonderful

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.910 
slick and so now you have a wonderful
spring<00:00:52.449> product<00:00:53.290> we<00:00:53.379> call<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.680> spring

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
spring product we call it spring

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.579 
spring product we call it spring
solution<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.659> hurts<00:00:55.960> how<00:00:56.110> we<00:00:56.320> deal<00:00:56.530> with

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
solution so it hurts how we deal with

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.710 
solution so it hurts how we deal with
strictly<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.369> elements<00:00:57.940> underneath<00:00:58.390> the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
strictly the elements underneath the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.660 
strictly the elements underneath the
base<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.530> ski<00:00:59.799> or<00:00:59.890> the<00:00:59.979> snowboard<00:01:00.460> that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
base of the ski or the snowboard that

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.969 
base of the ski or the snowboard that
happens<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.330> be<00:01:01.449> water<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.019> pollens<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:02.890> the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
happens to be water and pollens in the

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:03.479 
happens to be water and pollens in the
spring

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
spring

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.609 
spring
tell<00:01:04.299> me<00:01:04.420> about<00:01:04.510> white<00:01:04.780> gold<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.320> what<00:01:05.440> makes

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that so special white gold is probably

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.620 
that so special white gold is probably
one<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> most<00:01:12.000> significant<00:01:13.000> advances<00:01:13.600> in

overlays<00:03:27.630> overlays<00:03:28.630> are<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.930> substitution<00:03:29.830> to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
overlays overlays are a substitution to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.830 
overlays overlays are a substitution to
me<00:03:30.190> for<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.850> wax<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.690> doesn't<00:03:31.989> work<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:34.540> reading

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
me for a wax it doesn't work in reading

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.990 
me for a wax it doesn't work in reading
about<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:36.100> different<00:03:36.459> companies<00:03:36.700> have

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
about the different companies have

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.620 
about the different companies have
overlays<00:03:37.480> all<00:03:37.989> they're<00:03:38.260> doing<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.590> taken<00:03:39.630> what

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
overlays all they're doing is taken what

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.390 
overlays all they're doing is taken what
they<00:03:40.660> call<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.170> they're<00:03:41.410> fluorocarbon<00:03:42.250> and

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
they call it they're fluorocarbon and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.350 
they call it they're fluorocarbon and
they<00:03:43.060> adjust<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.660> with<00:03:44.110> different<00:03:44.560> colored

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
they adjust it with different colored

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.630 
they adjust it with different colored
type<00:03:46.360> overlays<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:46.840> they<00:03:47.140> got<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.320> different

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
type overlays so they got a different

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.699 
type overlays so they got a different
brick<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.790> wax<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.270> each<00:03:49.360> one<00:03:49.630> when<00:03:50.440> they<00:03:50.560> get

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
brick of wax for each one when they get

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.050 
brick of wax for each one when they get
to<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.950> top<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.520> mountain<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:51.940> they

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to the top of the mountain and they

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.670 
to the top of the mountain and they
found<00:03:52.300> out<00:03:52.450> their<00:03:52.630> products<00:03:53.050> not<00:03:53.230> working

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
found out their products not working

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.479 
found out their products not working
then<00:03:53.830> they<00:03:54.010> apply<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.430> proper<00:03:55.090> overlay<00:03:55.510> and

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
then they apply the proper overlay and

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.370 
then they apply the proper overlay and
that<00:03:57.489> gets<00:03:57.760> them<00:03:57.910> down<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.180> hill<00:03:58.330> it's<00:03:59.260> no

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
that gets them down the hill it's no

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.890 
that gets them down the hill it's no
different<00:03:59.800> than<00:03:59.860> than<00:04:00.820> having<00:04:01.150> colored<00:04:01.450> waxes

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900

different than than having colored waxes
is<00:04:02.110> what<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.950> know<00:04:03.070> in<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.120> hotboxing

is what it is you know in a hotboxing
some<00:04:05.320> people<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.709> asked<00:04:06.280> about<00:04:06.400> how

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
some people in the asked about how

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.310 
some people in the asked about how
boxing<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.120> want<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.360> know<00:04:07.450> what<00:04:07.690> really<00:04:08.140> is

boxing I want to know what really is

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.680 
boxing I want to know what really is
behind<00:04:08.650> hot<00:04:08.920> boxing<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.300> thickness

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
behind hot boxing you know the thickness

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.360 
behind hot boxing you know the thickness
of<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.930> base<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.340> only<00:04:12.550> about<00:04:12.970> four<00:04:13.390> thousandths

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
of a base is only about four thousandths

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.370 
of a base is only about four thousandths
and<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:16.120> measured<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.630> base<00:04:16.810> back<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.260> the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
and I measured a base back here the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.289 
and I measured a base back here the
other<00:04:17.500> day<00:04:17.590> my<00:04:18.100> question<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.669> how<00:04:18.880> far<00:04:19.120> back

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
other day my question is how far back

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.560 
other day my question is how far back
can<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.570> get<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.410> wax<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:21.760> go<00:04:21.910> back<00:04:22.120> into<00:04:22.360> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
can you get the wax to go back into the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.560 
can you get the wax to go back into the
pores<00:04:22.870> with<00:04:23.770> traditional<00:04:24.520> waxes<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.120> all<00:04:25.449> the
