00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:10.249
 I'm in a place that recorded the part of 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.459
 behind the kitchen of my house we go to 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:14.839
 make a mini nerva 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.219
 this is a modification for the clips 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.640
 Not that I like a lot because 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.770
 it seems that it did not go through anything in your 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.340
 good charger we're going to need a clip 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.340
 nothing 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 a knife of segueta ah well the 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 next full I do not have the bow 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 a dvd box 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 a good supergag one very powerful 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.310
 this is one very famous in Mexico with the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.310
 crazy a screwdriver and scissors 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 we are going to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.620
 take out that we're going to remove in the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.430
 screws to this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.430
 fair 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.870
 as it costs you a little bit of 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.870
 work but yes it is possible 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 ah 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.090
 now let's take now let's do 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090
 slightly 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.680
 slightly and we're going to take out this little 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.680
 spring you have here 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 that little black thing takes turns, you have to take it out 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.810
 that's why they take the scissors 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.740
 the scissors are the tweezers either 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.360
 of the other serves 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.530
 and associated 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.530
 keep this 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.160
 we go 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.310
 they take the equipment like this and they are going to cut it 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 all this about this 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 to contribute a piece 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.240
 good women 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 All this 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.440
 from here to below 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.000
 I come back not only with the just cut 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.430
 well that's more or less what we should 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.609
 to have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.709
 click cut out this guy are going to enter 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:20.590
 five darts the same let's be something 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.330
 productive with the piece that we cut 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.260
 I will remember it so I can 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.800
 get in 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.150
 here 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.160
 so I can take it out in the part of 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 down as the lid 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.000
 and the segments are short good 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.220
 the program can do this to do 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.250
 the bottom part of the clip so let's go 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.250
 to make the dvd box we go home 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.330
 let's take the dvd house 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.540
 we look like 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.540
 record in this bovine plastic 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.099
 Well, what do we do? 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.099
 the musician in this 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.550
 to take your kit what are you going to do 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.550
 this 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.599
 for the size of 15 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.970
 to cut it and well after that 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.379
 have done good and escapes and that 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.290
 is cutting later to make 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.990
 video fast when you 're finished 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.580
 do the part here 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.620
 the emotions as they remain as not 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.060
 since they were reminded that it was something 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.380
 well but let's take now 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.380
 this piece that stays inside 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.989
 they take the spring that we take out they agree 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.000
 it is fully seated seek it is 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:54.250
 so within the joke they take this what 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 come down now they are going to take the piece of dvd 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.530
 and here in the surroundings they are going to put 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.530
 super glue 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.930
 it's what I'm doing 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.260
 very carefully 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.400
 and that 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.950
 they're going to take it and they're going to put it in the clip 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.950
 of pressure to our points 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 now 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.689
 since you work 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.729
 but if you can say that 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.810
 and of not achieving and now it awaits you in the 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.620
 that these echoes 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.090
 pressing down 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.090
 then do not pressure us 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.310
 Acosta because this work 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.530
 4 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.530
 If that did not fit well, put it on more 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:07.380
 and good when what is lost in the end 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.020
 useless minimized about pretty well I 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.509
 taste 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.249
 and has these things black board already dry 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.959
 the super-glue 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.889
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.889
