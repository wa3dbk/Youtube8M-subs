00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.719
 This item is made possible by 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.719
 deltion college and aj qmedia 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.900
 while all those present from the rhedens 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.700
 watched a conference 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.719
 demonstration training of old pec zwolle 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 coach art longer 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.870
 pec zwolle was busy with the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.800
 preparation for Sunday's game 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.530
 against Feyenoord 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.540
 what an interesting one can be for 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.390
 our naturally beautiful ending 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.340
 feyenoord and yes 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.230
 competing for sixth place but yes 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.769
 but Feyenoord is pretty busy 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 everyone knows that and yes you have too 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.269
 consequence for who becomes our opponent 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.219
 in the play-offs for us it becomes one 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.170
 I hope a wonderful ending of one 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.010
 just very good out of season in everyone 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.629
 so a number of players close 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.109
 joost me for that is me too 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.030
 nice but if you look the pressure that lies 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.039
 at feyenoord with the opponent and that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.839
 is a human being for us is certainly not 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.069
 easy brother you play there is danger 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.489
 norton 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.799
 yes that is no no small club 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.170
 indeed now have a lot of pressure 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.590
 they are last weeks 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.570
 less but that doesn't mean we 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.560
 easy afternoon go and get 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.140
 maybe you can maybe something 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.210
 freer football we can do a free 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.610
 football i say you know you that you 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.070
 there are already creates 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.080
 little to play but you want with one 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.340
 good feeling the ones entering playoffs 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.050
 that match of last weekend 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.730
 Against FC Groningen there was after a long time 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.770
 once again won good for it 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.410
 feeling and trust 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.940
 yes feelings good of course one again 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.310
 kind of reluctantly towards Groningen 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.810
 but we just picked it up well and and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.400
 won that it felt anyway 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.130
 a bit good 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.690
 yeah I hope to persevere and yes in 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.000
 the bios suddenly feel good 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.260
 again someday we can just have a good one 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.240
 plow too 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.860
 and I hope that there is still ours on 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.380
 can focus and we just go for it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 you if you look at the the training 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.150
 From today I can 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.680
 notice that it is end season and it 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.110
 is really about the competitions because me 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 she thinks the will is there but the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.340
 real sharp and the quality on the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.649
 I thought training was better a little while ago 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.880
 then then now actually but that does not say 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.110
 so much about competitions but we have to 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.670
 play such a match as at home 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.620
 Ajax 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.930
 because that just makes it good again 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.970
 out for me and you did absolutely 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.290
 needed to get a chance in the play-offs 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.610
 want to feel good with the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.200
 play-offs in one 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.799
 and that is why you would also like to win 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 home from feyenoord and yes it is still 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.939
 popping one or two or four times and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.069
 and then you may already have something whole 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.890
 beautiful for competition then 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.260
 yes i don't know i want one we have 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.829
 influence that we draft and how we 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.209
 but yes you are at feyenoord who 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.819
 just have to win something else 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.590
 yes they just walk that third place 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.629
 and they have to move something because 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.010
 the all that is suspended once again the 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.109
 we press them on 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.069
 so yes that can be paralyzing but 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.879
 also yes make you feel anyway 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.040
 nothing left to lose 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.599
 but look for us watch we just go 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.879
