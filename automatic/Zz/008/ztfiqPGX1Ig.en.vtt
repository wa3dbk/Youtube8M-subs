right<00:03:17.290> time<00:03:17.829> did<00:03:18.069> I<00:03:23.069> grew<00:03:24.069> up<00:03:24.159> eating<00:03:24.310> Korean

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
right time did I grew up eating Korean

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.119 
right time did I grew up eating Korean
food<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.239> consider<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.810> comfort<00:03:26.260> food<00:03:26.470> but

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
food so I consider a comfort food but

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.800 
food so I consider a comfort food but
since<00:03:27.340> my<00:03:27.489> mom<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.760> grandma<00:03:28.209> were<00:03:28.359> such<00:03:28.569> great

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
since my mom and grandma were such great

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.890 
since my mom and grandma were such great
cooks<00:03:29.169> I<00:03:29.409> never<00:03:29.919> learned<00:03:30.220> how<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.400> make<00:03:30.609> it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
cooks I never learned how to make it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.240 
cooks I never learned how to make it
then<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.049> got<00:03:32.230> married<00:03:32.469> and<00:03:32.769> moved<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:33.159> the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
then I got married and moved to the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.610 
then I got married and moved to the
Midwest<00:03:33.780> there's<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> lot<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.260> Korean

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
Midwest there's not a lot of Korean

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.559 
Midwest there's not a lot of Korean
restaurants<00:03:36.159> in<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.340> Midwest<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:37.329> we<00:03:37.450> quickly

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
restaurants in the Midwest so we quickly

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.020 
restaurants in the Midwest so we quickly
realized<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.290> if<00:03:38.680> we<00:03:39.099> wanted<00:03:39.250> more<00:03:39.549> variety

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
realized that if we wanted more variety

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.339 
realized that if we wanted more variety
we'd<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.689> learn<00:03:40.840> how<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.989> cook<00:03:41.200> it

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
we'd have to learn how to cook it

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.920 
we'd have to learn how to cook it
ourselves<00:03:41.909> one<00:03:42.909> day<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.090> co-worker<00:03:43.540> told<00:03:43.780> me

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930
