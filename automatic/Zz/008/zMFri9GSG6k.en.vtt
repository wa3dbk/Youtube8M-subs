00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.750
 video review we shoot such a fountain with 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.940
 beautiful figures figures 2 tips 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.490
 means separately would like a scalper 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 fountain it is a little complicated assembly but 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 at least now hold detailed 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 struct already how to connect it to home 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.000
 conditions means the fountain consists of two 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.119
 from the tank here such 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.109
 water is poured in the old coasters 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.400
 the top delivery is present which 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 capillary chick and wire to connect 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.130
 power supply to the lighting bulb here 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.559
 there is such an LED 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.940
 means how to make a connection 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 we have this daddy on the pump 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 maximum position control is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.610
 plus the minimum position is minus 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 let's say we put the maximum 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.050
 position in plus further necessary pump 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 connect to this capillary so here 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.680
 way that is just take let's say and 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.730
 cheat like this pretty tight 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.100
 connection further needs to be made 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.290
 the connection here is a connector 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 there is no insert it always like this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.850
 in the image and then from above we wind such 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.630
 here is the sealing ring 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:18.509
 after that we have this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.470
 connectors have power supply necessary 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 make the connection affects 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.939
 then you need to install 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.409
 stand so that through here 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.110
 this hole correctly went through ours 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.430
 right Skopin wiring so so 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.410
 it will look like this next we take 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.850
 we fill with some water the capacity of this fountain 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.340
 I think you need at least 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.270
 than two liters of water well now we are in this 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 make sure 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.590
 let 's not think yet 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.659
 I think that this will be enough now 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.629
 we have a capacity of about two 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.400
 liters means to connect the fountain 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.500
 we need 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 power supply connect electrical networks 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.260
 deformation connect here we have some water 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.659
 let's say so rise through the top so 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.099
 in a beautiful way 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.959
 illuminating now we will demonstrate 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.150
 night time how will it be 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.049
 look about an hour like a day 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.940
 now you will see will be so beautiful 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.680
 action principle at night will be very 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:04.620
 look interesting now turn on the light 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.239
 and you will see the fountain say so 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.220
 so not too noisy let's say so but 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.620
 there is a little noise like that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.870
 can be eliminated just like a pump 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.730
 more correctly placed the same 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.230
 do yourself the most home for this 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.790
 need to open the inside of the fountain 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.000
 and set them to touch 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.220
 the inner surfaces of the bowl are also 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.280
 we have such here 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.019
 pebbles on using these a bear you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.699
 can decorate your fountain that is 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.459
 place them let's say on surfaces 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:36.760
 is it around the perimeter either there inside as 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.769
 wish we won't do that then 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.409
 that there could be more to say about 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.180
 green of course the fountain given in 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.889
 industrial china but this should not you 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.940
 embarrass the quality of the fountain is on 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.980
 good level 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.530
 all parts are carefully made 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.540
 qualitatively does not cause also 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.190
 the fountain is worth a switch 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:01.630
 convenient that is, you can turn off 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.690
 and enjoyed this action to whom it is 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.790
 things interesting who wants to bring 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.100
 go online shop to buy a souvenir 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.460
 and make your bar customized get 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.460
 thank
