is a an at all and the only apt all we
have<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> united<00:01:04.199> states<00:01:04.640> it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
have here in the united states it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
have here in the united states it's
quite<00:01:05.880> interesting<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.900> all

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
quite interesting because it's all

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
quite interesting because it's all
wildlife<00:01:07.650> has<00:01:08.100> water<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> center<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.180> it

wildlife has water in the center of it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
wildlife has water in the center of it
that's<00:01:09.510> why<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.930> considered<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.740> all

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that's why it's considered an at all

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.149 
that's why it's considered an at all
it's<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.360> reef<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.710> been<00:01:13.890> built

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it's really a reef that has been built

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's really a reef that has been built
up<00:01:14.340> over<00:01:14.520> centuries<00:01:14.780> that's<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
up over centuries that's out of the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
up over centuries that's out of the
water<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.580> course<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.090> reefs<00:01:18.390> all

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
water and of course there are reefs all

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.179 
water and of course there are reefs all
around<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.350> still<00:01:19.590> under<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.890> water

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
around it but are still under the water

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.640 
around it but are still under the water
and<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.360> habitat<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.530> will

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and this is the habitat where we will

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.420 
and this is the habitat where we will
find<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.850> fishing<00:01:24.830> one<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> things<00:01:26.220> we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
find good fishing one of the things we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
find good fishing one of the things we

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
where I want to go today of course I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350 
where I want to go today of course I
already<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.979> them<00:01:59.159> programmed<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.240> it's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
already have them programmed in so it's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.880 
already have them programmed in so it's
much<00:02:00.540> easier<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.210> direct<00:02:03.450> me

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
much easier and it will then direct me

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
much easier and it will then direct me
