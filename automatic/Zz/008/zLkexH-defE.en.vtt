 black yes and I will do that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.949
 what i can not do is the camera 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 at least a little bit always 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 problems the camera is just looking for times 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.030
 we need any people out 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.030
 to be pounded the walker 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.579
 that's why it's the stuff 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.820
 and on we go 1 1 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.530
 33 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.160
 quite a sweat I brought 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160
 turn me away 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.540
 shamelessly exploited 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.540
 eat 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.680
 a 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680
 Super 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.330
 so now felix looks like three times 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.330
 he strikes himself 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.069
 this is how a polar bear has an easy time here 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.920
 I have to say so clearly so far 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.920
 not lost but after 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.760
 not really rubber for the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.280
 7 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.989
 how about a rematch against the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.359
 proi the fight for the house not the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.359
 I had the honor to go out 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.180
 the rest of it knows just fine 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.350
 I'm just sweating too easily 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.520
 come there to win 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.750
 next time we have to do one 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.880
 Of course, challenge also does it halfway 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.510
 A chance from where I can not stand up against 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.160
 I'll lose his girls one more time 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.750
 once important a girl won and 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.250
 That's why I feel as good as I did 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.600

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.070

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.570
 Do you find the dancing that we are here 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.340

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.200

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.360
