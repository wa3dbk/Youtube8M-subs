good here alright there we go now a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.180 
good here alright there we go now a
strategy<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.060> these<00:02:58.390> missiles<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.230> kind<00:03:00.040> of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
strategy for these missiles is kind of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.190 
strategy for these missiles is kind of
the<00:03:00.280> hang<00:03:00.490> out<00:03:00.670> around<00:03:00.820> great<00:03:01.270> Fox<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.050> then

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
the hang out around great Fox and then

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.960 
the hang out around great Fox and then
Rob<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.650> let<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:02.980> when<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.370> next<00:03:03.459> wave

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
Rob will let you know when the next wave

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.600 
Rob will let you know when the next wave
is<00:03:04.209> coming<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.780> when<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.620> hear<00:03:05.980> him<00:03:06.220> say<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
is coming and when you hear him say the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.420 
is coming and when you hear him say the
next<00:03:06.880> wave<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.330> something<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:08.740> good<00:03:09.130> to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
next wave is something it's good to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.070 
next wave is something it's good to
kinda<00:03:09.880> they<00:03:10.090> always<00:03:10.420> come<00:03:10.690> from<00:03:10.930> that

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
kinda they always come from that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.070 
kinda they always come from that
southern<00:03:11.560> direction<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.300> kind<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.780> good

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
southern direction so it's kind of good

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.570 
southern direction so it's kind of good
oh<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.740> also<00:03:14.860> get<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.160> new<00:03:15.340> wave<00:03:15.550> of

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
oh and you also get a new wave of

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.550 
oh and you also get a new wave of
enemies<00:03:15.910> after<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.630> first<00:03:16.870> missile<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
enemies after the first missile and the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.060 
enemies after the first missile and the
second<00:03:17.980> ones<00:03:18.130> come<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:20.020> helps<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.620> come<00:03:20.890> in

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
second ones come in it helps to come in

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.980 
second ones come in it helps to come in
from<00:03:21.310> an<00:03:21.400> angle<00:03:21.880> I've<00:03:22.000> found<00:03:22.300> because<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
from an angle I've found because the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.350 
from an angle I've found because the
next<00:03:23.320> two<00:03:23.560> waves<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:24.160> missiles<00:03:24.610> come<00:03:24.940> in<00:03:25.060> twos

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
next two waves of missiles come in twos

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.250 
next two waves of missiles come in twos
and<00:03:25.600> threes<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.610> found<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.300> coming<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.810> and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
and threes so I found that coming in and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.040 
and threes so I found that coming in and
angle<00:03:29.590> kind<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.220> helps<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.850> part<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:31.990> is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
angle kind of helps and part of this is

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.259 
angle kind of helps and part of this is
due<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.530> fact<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.250> move<00:03:33.550> faster

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
due to the fact that you move faster

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.949 
due to the fact that you move faster
than<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.570> missiles<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:37.420> helps<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.930> just

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
than the missiles so it helps to just

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.180 
than the missiles so it helps to just
kind<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.500> go<00:03:38.680> sideways<00:03:39.130> as<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.820> hit<00:03:40.150> them

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
kind of go sideways as you hit them

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.620 
kind of go sideways as you hit them
because<00:03:42.190> you're<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.700> might<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.480> make

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
because you're you might have to make

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.530 
because you're you might have to make
more<00:03:43.959> than<00:03:43.989> one<00:03:44.170> lap<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.940> do<00:03:46.150> have<00:03:46.360> to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
more than one lap and if you do have to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.630 
more than one lap and if you do have to
make<00:03:46.570> more<00:03:46.959> than<00:03:47.170> one<00:03:47.410> lap<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:48.160> good<00:03:48.459> to

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
make more than one lap it's good to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.970 
make more than one lap it's good to
zigzag<00:03:48.940> back<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.510> forth<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.320> be<00:03:50.470> able<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.800> keep

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
zigzag back and forth to be able to keep

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.449 
zigzag back and forth to be able to keep
hitting<00:03:51.220> them<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:53.070> hopefully<00:03:54.070> your

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
hitting them and hopefully your

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.160 
hitting them and hopefully your
teammates<00:03:54.910> will<00:03:55.239> help<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.690> out<00:03:55.810> with<00:03:56.050> the
