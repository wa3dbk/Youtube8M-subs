00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.980
 Hello friends NDC is shorter in any way 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.459
 just a few seconds on video by 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.299
 about handwriting 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.299
 in a different spelling in the message 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:14.949
 I will tell the first in myself and what 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.739
 yes I am skeptical of this 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.749
 functions never understood in any way 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.820
 him cell phones because he 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.970
 used it 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.919
 we are pretty uncomfortable 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.539
 because you have to spend all the same 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.029
 a little more time 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.429
 to write these characters what 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.170
 what if 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.300
 do not use 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.630
 standard year on and there are 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.480
 by hands 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.910
 typing text or use it our 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.270
 small keyboard 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090
 here for example here such here 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 so how much is convenient for me to use 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.040
 I do not know, but if you believe 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.110
 someone is interested and here I am for such 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.210
 did saw 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.660
 I'll say right away 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.440
 under the second number that ng 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.720
 you need to write exactly as we write 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.370
 manually that is all for special not 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.160
 picking up characters and otherwise mouthing them 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.550
 eg 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.910
 m if you write a book of coupe 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.480
 it must be written as we write it that is 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.170
 vodka in handwriting 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.430
 that is, not so here is its outlined book of the coupe 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 describe as we do not write a letter n 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.850
 vodka 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.450
 enjoy and not say that very uncomfortable 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.009
 these reasons because she told her 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.650
 what's the price spent but r time is it all 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.479
 in the drawing 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.729
 than we if we would choose 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.469
 of these characters that are us 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:37.640
 is provided 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.729
 but nevertheless here we write for example 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.860
 word 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 example yes 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.240
 as you can see n anyway errors 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.979
 repeat removes mini not always happen 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:55.940
 comfortable 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.789
 for example, so you can delete but it happens that 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.819
 I'm not deleting and writing the right instead. 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.930
 you can enter one 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.680
 one character for example with a word 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.009
 laptops coupe 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.109
 You can enter this idea all at once. 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.069
 phrase but if the country will not fit 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.289
 they 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.679
 not so convenient 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.659
 here but anyway tench 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 writing uncomfortable with 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.579
 premiere 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.479
 so he is automatically 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.329
 PC tries to pick those letters right there 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.569
 which correspond 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.249
 writing my characters 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.229
 respectively choosing a vision and 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.749
 I can write numbers here 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.009
 the driver 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.579
 eight 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.179
 900 3 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.029
 850 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.029
 6 70 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.179
 Well, it seems to be correct, but in any case, no 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.869
 somehow 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.389
 how it all does not look very 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.529
 OK 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.239
 here it is 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.249
 if the circulation is cobra 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.760
 go into the bypass hammer then in this 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.049
 case you can delete 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.870
 if monte will write rf tuesday 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.189
 Adam single prices in digit mode not 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.279
 remove years 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.339
 under always lose roter terrorist attack 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.889
 poet but she to remove go to 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.549
 letters to mode in mode 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.809
 weather letters 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.429
 and only after this is the sand cube 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.360
 but 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.719
 can try tons 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.799
 latin letters 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.159
 language year 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.989
 English 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.099
 eg 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.599
 Ji 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.639
 that's interesting how to display large 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.809
 in letters 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.179
 here for example 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.789
 and if you write 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.019
 eg 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.019
 trust percentage 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.569
 does not matter 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.269
 small letters fired 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.269
 such a latin letter yahoo 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.509
 Vova 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.839
 and so did not take 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.839
 boom 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:19.809
 send letter 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.659
 well in general 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.229
 slightly convenient forms easier to use with 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.080
 built-in keyboard 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.509
 well let's try 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.509
 enclose these rings in all language 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.939
 ohh but unfortunately 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:37.009
 no Chinese any 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.009
 here is Ukrainian for example 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 and she again 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.870
 Well, approx 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.870
 but you can see how everything is entered 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:04.419
 i will say that 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.500
 opinion personally 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.190
 comfortable with this ring function 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.089
 useless i never 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:12.059
 as told no poland minaks yet 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:13.919

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.349
 plus of course pesetas 8 00 to what 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.330
 there is a small 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.220
 keyboard that can be used and 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.529
 accordingly and contribute it 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.789
 m because most of the time 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.129
 in Kolomna phones are used immediately 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.900
 full size keyboard 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.770
 here he is 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.789
 nothing is always convenient 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.039
 driver 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.210
 Samara writing there for China texts 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.960
