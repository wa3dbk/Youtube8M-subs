00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
around 10:00 to 5:00 so it might work on

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.400 
around 10:00 to 5:00 so it might work on
this<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.209> just<00:03:10.480> work<00:03:11.019> around<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
this you know I just work around the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.950 
this you know I just work around the
library<00:03:11.560> hours

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.010 

some<00:03:16.960> people<00:03:17.290> do<00:03:17.500> decide<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:19.660> decide

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
some people do decide to get they decide

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.920 
some people do decide to get they decide
to<00:03:20.050> pay<00:03:20.260> for<00:03:20.470> their<00:03:20.590> Wi-Fi<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:24.720> that's<00:03:25.720> not

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
to pay for their Wi-Fi and that's not

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.230 
to pay for their Wi-Fi and that's not
really<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.500> best<00:03:26.530> idea<00:03:27.040> because<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.670> guess

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
really the best idea because I guess

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.720 
really the best idea because I guess
some<00:03:28.870> people<00:03:28.900> will<00:03:29.230> pay<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.800> fifty<00:03:30.430> dollars

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
some people will pay like fifty dollars

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.340 
some people will pay like fifty dollars
a<00:03:30.760> month<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.360> minute<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.750> line<00:03:31.959> accom

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
a month for a minute and the line accom

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.010 
a month for a minute and the line accom
so<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.160> way<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:34.090> Wi-Fi<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
so that way you can have Wi-Fi in the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.740 
so that way you can have Wi-Fi in the
mountains<00:03:35.500> or<00:03:35.830> wherever<00:03:36.190> you're<00:03:36.520> at<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:37.180> guess

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
mountains or wherever you're at I guess

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.610 
mountains or wherever you're at I guess
you<00:03:38.470> know<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:40.120> you're<00:03:40.480> out<00:03:40.630> there<00:03:40.900> there's

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
you know if if you're out there there's

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.190 
you know if if you're out there there's
really<00:03:42.520> no<00:03:42.790> McDonald's<00:03:43.030> around<00:03:43.569> if<00:03:43.900> there's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
really no McDonald's around if there's

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.610 
really no McDonald's around if there's
no<00:03:45.420> Dunkin<00:03:46.420> Donuts<00:03:46.780> around<00:03:46.930> then<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.350> guess

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
no Dunkin Donuts around then I guess

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.500 
no Dunkin Donuts around then I guess
that's<00:03:47.830> your<00:03:48.070> only<00:03:48.220> option<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.910> try<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.330> get

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
that's your only option but I try to get

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.770 
that's your only option but I try to get
it<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:49.840> free<00:03:49.870> as<00:03:50.739> much<00:03:51.070> as<00:03:51.280> possible<00:03:51.910> another
