players and I was kind of surprised
about<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.130> mean<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.430> surprised<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.060> guys

about that I mean I'm surprised you guys

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.520 
about that I mean I'm surprised you guys
don't<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:45.990> hybrids<00:01:46.439> or

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
don't want to see some hybrids or

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.270 
don't want to see some hybrids or
something<00:01:46.799> cuz

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
something cuz

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
something cuz
you<00:01:47.400> can<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.670> we've<00:01:47.820> got<00:01:47.850> focus<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.479> storage

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you can see we've got focus on storage

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780 
you can see we've got focus on storage
up<00:01:48.900> there<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.229> they're<00:01:49.350> both<00:01:49.470> ppl<00:01:49.890> players<00:01:50.340> but

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
up there so they're both ppl players but

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
up there so they're both ppl players but
we<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.060> easily<00:01:51.210> put<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> player<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
we can easily put in a player in the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
we can easily put in a player in the
center<00:01:52.619> attack<00:01:52.770> admits<00:01:53.070> book<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.490> informal

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
center attack admits book like informal

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
center attack admits book like informal
Ilana<00:01:54.450> he'll<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.170> double<00:01:55.560> strongly<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
Ilana he'll get a double strongly in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.200 
Ilana he'll get a double strongly in
storage<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.820> fine<00:01:57.000> with

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
storage so that will be fine with

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.910 
storage so that will be fine with
chemistry<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.110> maybe<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.650> play<00:01:58.799> on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
chemistry and then maybe just to play on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.080 
chemistry and then maybe just to play on
the<00:01:59.040> left<00:01:59.190> hand<00:01:59.310> side<00:01:59.430> which<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.820> link<00:01:59.970> up

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the left hand side which will link up

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.120 
the left hand side which will link up
with<00:02:00.240> our<00:02:00.420> gas<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> force<00:02:01.380> lallana's<00:02:01.920> will

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
with our gas and a force lallana's will

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.469 
with our gas and a force lallana's will
now<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> strongly<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> left

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
now get a strongly and then the left

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.540 
now get a strongly and then the left
back<00:02:03.690> then<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> other<00:02:04.740> side<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.430> be

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
back then that other side can just be

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.100 
back then that other side can just be
like<00:02:05.729> another<00:02:06.060> league<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.630> another

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
like another league or another

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
like another league or another
nationality<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> hybrid

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
nationality you can make it a hybrid

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.070 
nationality you can make it a hybrid
that<00:02:08.759> way<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.450> yeah<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.630> hope<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.929> guys

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that way so yeah I hope you guys

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260 
that way so yeah I hope you guys

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.809 
finally get into a game we're going to
see<00:02:16.470> how<00:02:16.650> people<00:02:16.980> are<00:02:17.040> gas<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.340> stowage<00:02:17.640> up

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
see how people are gas and stowage up

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.720 
see how people are gas and stowage up
for<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.450> team<00:02:18.980> okay<00:02:19.980> guys<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.489> found

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
for this team okay guys we have found

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.460 
for this team okay guys we have found
our<00:02:20.970> opponent<00:02:21.660> will<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> actually<00:02:22.200> come<00:02:22.440> up

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
our opponent will you actually come up

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890 
our opponent will you actually come up
against<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.950> guy<00:02:23.160> using<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.940> full<00:02:24.269> Brazilian
