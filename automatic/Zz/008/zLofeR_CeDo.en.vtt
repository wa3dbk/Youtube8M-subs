and<00:02:12.400> stuff<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.820> just<00:02:13.270> think<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.720> ending

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and stuff I just think this is ending

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.280 
and stuff I just think this is ending
crate<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.920> not<00:02:15.610> um<00:02:16.000> what<00:02:16.630> was<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:16.870> trying

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
crate in not um what was I just trying

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.980 
crate in not um what was I just trying
to<00:02:17.380> say<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.740> crazy<00:02:18.130> okay<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.270> think<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.960> a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
to say and crazy okay I think this is a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.770 
to say and crazy okay I think this is a
crazy<00:02:20.610> survival<00:02:21.610> scene<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.060> go<00:02:22.240> generate<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
crazy survival scene so go generate the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.000 
crazy survival scene so go generate the
seed<00:02:22.990> right<00:02:23.140> now<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.590> crazy

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
seed right now it is crazy

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.710 
seed right now it is crazy
sadly<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> world<00:02:24.850> isn't<00:02:25.060> generating<00:02:25.570> right

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
sadly the world isn't generating right

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.060 
sadly the world isn't generating right
now<00:02:25.900> let<00:02:26.380> me<00:02:26.410> see<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.800> go<00:02:26.890> ahead<00:02:26.980> and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
now let me see if I can go ahead and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.490 
now let me see if I can go ahead and
fall<00:02:27.370> down<00:02:27.400> here<00:02:27.820> we<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.090> see<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.480> other<00:02:28.660> face

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
fall down here we can see the other face

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
fall down here we can see the other face
or<00:02:29.800> side<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.730> amount<00:02:31.030> obviously<00:02:31.600> it's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
or side of this amount obviously it's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.390 
or side of this amount obviously it's
just<00:02:31.990> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.440> be<00:02:32.530> huge<00:02:32.890> mountain<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.280> can

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
just going to be huge mountain we can

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.070 
just going to be huge mountain we can
actually<00:02:33.520> oh<00:02:33.700> okay<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> world<00:02:34.870> isn't

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
actually oh okay so the world isn't

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.660 
actually oh okay so the world isn't
generating<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:35.770> can<00:02:35.890> actually<00:02:36.040> see<00:02:36.370> where

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
generating so we can actually see where

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.220 
generating so we can actually see where
the<00:02:36.760> cave<00:02:36.940> systems<00:02:37.360> are<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.690> they're<00:02:37.810> all<00:02:37.930> our

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the cave systems are so they're all our

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.290 
the cave systems are so they're all our
cave<00:02:39.100> systems<00:02:39.490> in<00:02:39.610> here<00:02:39.730> looks<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.180> have

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
cave systems in here looks like we have

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.290 
cave systems in here looks like we have
a<00:02:40.330> small<00:02:40.660> ravine<00:02:41.050> down<00:02:41.110> there<00:02:41.500> too<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.400> thanks

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300

a small ravine down there too so thanks
to<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.540> world<00:02:43.720> not<00:02:43.900> generating<00:02:44.380> we<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.620> see

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
to the world not generating we can see

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.960 
to the world not generating we can see
what's<00:02:44.890> going<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.400> obviously<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.850> other

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
huge massive waterfall as you can see

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.020 
huge massive waterfall as you can see
right<00:03:05.080> here<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.460> looks<00:03:06.910> awesome

right here and it just looks awesome
there's<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> case<00:03:07.720> okay<00:03:08.020> there's<00:03:08.230> not<00:03:08.320> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
there's not a case okay there's not the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.200 
there's not a case okay there's not the
cases<00:03:08.740> right<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.760> other<00:03:09.910> side<00:03:10.120> of

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
cases right there so the other side of

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.460 
cases right there so the other side of
the<00:03:10.270> mountain<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.690> going<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.110> look<00:03:11.230> somewhat

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
the mountain is going to look somewhat

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.660 
the mountain is going to look somewhat
similar<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.980> front<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.550> not

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.900 
and I think just surviving on this would
be<00:03:25.990> insane<00:03:26.740> I<00:03:26.770> think<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.280> would<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.460> awesome

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
