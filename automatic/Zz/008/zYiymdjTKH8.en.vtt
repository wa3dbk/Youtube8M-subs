that's a car by the way
we<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:45.810> usually<00:00:46.050> consider<00:00:46.380> that<00:00:46.740> as<00:00:46.920> the

refer<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.909> thermal<00:01:24.359> long<00:01:24.509> life

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
refer to that as the thermal long life

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.169 
refer to that as the thermal long life
because<00:01:24.899> that's<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.999> outside

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
because that's kind of the the outside

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.410 
because that's kind of the the outside
bit<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.840> protects<00:01:28.170> us<00:01:28.319> from<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.549> direct

bit that protects us from the direct

bit that protects us from the direct
elements<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.319> then<00:01:31.799> there's<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.039> course<00:01:32.069> the

elements and then there's of course the
ground<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.719> square<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.789> simply

fix pipes that I'm worried about pipes
they<00:01:52.049> worry<00:01:52.289> about<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> joints<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.249> that's

they worry about the joints and that's

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.969 
they worry about the joints and that's
the<00:01:54.209> same<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> thermal<00:01:55.619> envelope

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the same with the thermal envelope

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.609 
the same with the thermal envelope
it's<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> joins<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:58.139> are<00:01:58.439> the

it's where the joins are that are the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
it's where the joins are that are the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really important bits to get right

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
really important bits to get right

I've<00:02:58.800> seen<00:02:59.390> after<00:03:00.390> lighting<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:03.000> causes

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
I've seen after lighting and that causes

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.900 
I've seen after lighting and that causes
a<00:03:03.510> huge<00:03:03.960> amount<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.380> heat<00:03:04.560> loss<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:05.550> through

a huge amount of heat loss up through

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060 
a huge amount of heat loss up through
all<00:03:06.120> these<00:03:06.330> holes<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.020> particularly<00:03:07.710> when<00:03:07.980> we

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
all these holes and particularly when we

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.470 
all these holes and particularly when we
consider<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.580> fact<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.820> we<00:03:08.910> have<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.210> pull

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
consider the fact that we have to pull

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.430 
consider the fact that we have to pull
back<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.650> insulation<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:12.140> because<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
back the insulation here because it's a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.340 
back the insulation here because it's a
unless<00:03:14.280> there's<00:03:14.580> special<00:03:15.090> lights<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:16.230> a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
unless there's special lights it's a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.690 
unless there's special lights it's a
fire<00:03:16.560> hazard<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.370> insulation

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
fire hazard to have that insulation

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.230 
fire hazard to have that insulation
touching<00:03:18.470> those<00:03:19.470> lights<00:03:19.800> so<00:03:20.760> we<00:03:21.090> actually

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
touching those lights so we actually

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.930 
touching those lights so we actually
start<00:03:21.750> degrading<00:03:22.050> our<00:03:22.860> thermal<00:03:23.790> envelope

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
start degrading our thermal envelope

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.810 
start degrading our thermal envelope
quite<00:03:24.510> significantly<00:03:25.250> then<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.400> course<00:03:26.640> we

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
quite significantly then of course we

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.930 
quite significantly then of course we
need<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> get<00:03:27.150> into<00:03:27.300> our<00:03:27.420> house<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:29.220> have

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
need to get into our house so we have

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.830 
need to get into our house so we have
things<00:03:30.270> like<00:03:30.480> doors<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:32.280> we'll<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.360> windows

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
things like doors and we'll have windows

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.300 
things like doors and we'll have windows
and<00:03:35.150> all<00:03:36.150> these<00:03:36.360> things<00:03:36.720> start<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.650> impact<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
and all these things start to impact the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.010 
and all these things start to impact the
integrity<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.850> our<00:03:39.060> thermal<00:03:39.420> envelope<00:03:39.570> and

integrity of our thermal envelope and

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.310 
integrity of our thermal envelope and
that's<00:03:40.680> why<00:03:40.950> things<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.930> good<00:03:42.930> double

just wanted to quickly talk about what

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.060 
just wanted to quickly talk about what
