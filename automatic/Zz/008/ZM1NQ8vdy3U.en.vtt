00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
sound I was having an electrical problem

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.560 
sound I was having an electrical problem
i<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.990> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> sell<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.500> because<00:00:26.539> when<00:00:27.539> i

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
i was going to sell it because when i

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.060 
i was going to sell it because when i
sent<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.990> Intermountain<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:28.800> time

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
sent it to Intermountain the first time

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.550 
sent it to Intermountain the first time
and<00:00:29.310> had<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.420> they<00:00:30.750> didn't<00:00:31.349> really

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and had it back they didn't really

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.749 
and had it back they didn't really
change<00:00:31.769> anything<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.399> said<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> was

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
change anything and they said it was

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
change anything and they said it was
fine<00:00:33.170> which<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.320> completely<00:00:34.620> understandable

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
fine which was completely understandable

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.650 
fine which was completely understandable
just<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.910> probably<00:00:36.149> didn't<00:00:36.540> notice

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
just because they probably didn't notice

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.770 
just because they probably didn't notice
the<00:00:36.870> problem<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:37.829> were<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.780> was

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the problem and there were and there was

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.220 
the problem and there were and there was
a<00:00:39.809> more<00:00:40.079> common<00:00:40.320> issue<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.239> they<00:00:42.239> fixed<00:00:43.020> for

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
a more common issue that they fixed for

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.900 
a more common issue that they fixed for
but<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> didn't<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.010> change<00:00:44.280> anything<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
but I didn't really change anything so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.720 
but I didn't really change anything so
before<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> sold<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.110> thought<00:00:47.100> I'd<00:00:47.250> test<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
before I sold it I thought I'd test it

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
before I sold it I thought I'd test it
out<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> found<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
out and what I found was that now the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
out and what I found was that now the
electrical<00:00:50.700> problem<00:00:51.059> got<00:00:51.300> worse<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
electrical problem got worse as I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000 
electrical problem got worse as I
predicted<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.350> shorted<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
predicted and it just shorted out the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
predicted and it just shorted out the
whole<00:00:56.160> system<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> locomotive<00:00:57.210> was

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
whole system when the locomotive was

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.779 
whole system when the locomotive was
powered<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> sent<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.250> back<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> them

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
powered on so I sent that back to them

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
powered on so I sent that back to them
they<00:00:59.969> were<00:01:00.030> very<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.840> nice<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
they were very very nice about that and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
they were very very nice about that and
I<00:01:02.579> guess<00:01:02.820> they're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> look<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
I guess they're going to look at it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
I guess they're going to look at it
maybe<00:01:03.690> replace<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.320> repaired<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.070> know

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
maybe replace it repaired I don't know

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.500 
maybe replace it repaired I don't know
exactly<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.820> they're<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
exactly what they're going to do but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
exactly what they're going to do but
they'll<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
they'll make that right it's not this

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100 
they'll make that right it's not this

60<00:01:49.170> some<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> may<00:01:50.220> remember<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
60 some of you may remember that the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.859 
60 some of you may remember that the
last<00:01:51.149> SD<00:01:51.930> 60<00:01:52.320> i<00:01:52.350> had<00:01:52.619> was<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> proto<00:01:53.369> 2000<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
last SD 60 i had was a proto 2000 that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.859 
last SD 60 i had was a proto 2000 that
was<00:01:55.530> undecorated<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.520> i<00:01:56.579> painted<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.450> ej

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
was undecorated and i painted for ej

was undecorated and i painted for ej
andy<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.040> i<00:01:59.700> think<00:02:00.149> i<00:02:00.240> mentioned<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.659> i

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
andy and i think i mentioned that i

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.380 
andy and i think i mentioned that i
might<00:02:00.930> consider<00:02:01.530> getting<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.009> those<00:02:02.390> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
might consider getting one of those so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
might consider getting one of those so
it's<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> nice<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:05.070> one

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's kind of nice to actually have one

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.940 
it's kind of nice to actually have one
here<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.729> layout<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.469> came<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
here on my layout I came with the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
here on my layout I came with the
regular<00:02:08.399> incandescent<00:02:08.700> bulbs<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> front

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
regular incandescent bulbs in the front

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.770 
regular incandescent bulbs in the front
and<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.770> working<00:02:11.190> rear<00:02:11.400> light<00:02:11.640> bulb<00:02:11.849> but

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and not working rear light bulb but

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.520 
and not working rear light bulb but
since

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
since

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.880 
since
I've<00:02:13.680> started<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.190> two<00:02:14.550> LEDs<00:02:15.620> one<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
I've started on two LEDs one for the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.660 
I've started on two LEDs one for the
front<00:02:17.040> lights<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:19.050> see<00:02:19.260> there<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.770> one

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
front lights you can see there and one

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.510 
front lights you can see there and one
for<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> rear<00:02:21.360> light<00:02:21.950> they're<00:02:22.950> fairly<00:02:23.220> bright

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
for the rear light they're fairly bright

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.910 
for the rear light they're fairly bright
they<00:02:24.330> probably<00:02:24.540> look<00:02:24.959> better<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.380> little<00:02:25.740> bit

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
they probably look better a little bit

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.699 
they probably look better a little bit
better<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.250> camera<00:02:26.670> than<00:02:26.819> they<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.709> person

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
better in camera than they do in person

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.080 
better in camera than they do in person
I'm<00:02:29.160> having<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.459> little<00:02:29.520> bit<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.760> trouble<00:02:30.060> with

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
I'm having a little bit of trouble with

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.520 
I'm having a little bit of trouble with
programming<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.750> haven't<00:02:31.020> figured<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.350> all<00:02:31.470> out

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
programming I haven't figured it all out

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.400 
programming I haven't figured it all out
yet<00:02:31.860> apparently<00:02:32.780> with<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.810> rear<00:02:34.140> light<00:02:34.380> here

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
yet apparently with the rear light here

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.040 
yet apparently with the rear light here
I<00:02:35.030> thought<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.270> just<00:02:36.450> had<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.600> set<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
I thought I just had it set to a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.530 
I thought I just had it set to a
headlight<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.730> might<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.239> able<00:02:39.360> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
headlight but as you might be able to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
headlight but as you might be able to
see<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:40.250> sorry<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> shakiness<00:02:41.819> will

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
see here sorry for the shakiness will

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.330 
see here sorry for the shakiness will
get<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.300> stabilized<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.350> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
get it stabilized there we go it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.479 
get it stabilized there we go it
pulsates<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.200> don't<00:02:49.739> quite<00:02:50.040> know<00:02:50.100> what<00:02:50.400> I'll

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
pulsates so I don't quite know what I'll

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.740 
pulsates so I don't quite know what I'll
do<00:02:50.610> about<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.269> big<00:02:51.510> deal<00:02:51.540> i

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
do about that it's not a big deal i

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.030 
do about that it's not a big deal i
actually<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.290> thinking<00:02:52.350> about<00:02:52.680> making<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
actually was thinking about making it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.320 
actually was thinking about making it
pulsate<00:02:53.459> when<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:54.440> put<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.550> that's

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
pulsate when I I put it in so that's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.000 
pulsate when I I put it in so that's
that<00:02:57.570> I'll<00:02:57.750> probably<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> review<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.830> this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that I'll probably have a review on this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.850 
that I'll probably have a review on this
up<00:02:59.280> I<00:03:00.140> don't<00:03:01.140> know<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.380> I'll<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.560> around<00:03:01.680> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
up I don't know when I'll get around to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.410 
up I don't know when I'll get around to
making<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.430> i'll<00:03:02.580> probably<00:03:02.819> try<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> make

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
making it but i'll probably try to make

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.850 
making it but i'll probably try to make
the<00:03:03.540> review<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:06.230> it's<00:03:07.230> smooth<00:03:07.560> it's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the review about it it's smooth it's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740 
the review about it it's smooth it's
heavy<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:09.000> power<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.480> looks<00:03:09.630> pretty

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
heavy that power and it looks pretty

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.630 
heavy that power and it looks pretty
cool<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.069> what<00:03:11.220> I'm<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.459> do

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
cool I don't know what I'm going to do

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.979 
cool I don't know what I'm going to do
with<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.819> if<00:03:12.060> someone's<00:03:12.360> interested<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.870> it

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
with it if someone's interested in it

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.530 
with it if someone's interested in it
let<00:03:13.140> me<00:03:13.170> know<00:03:13.260> i<00:03:13.680> might<00:03:14.489> whether<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.970> might

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
let me know i might whether it might

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.140 
let me know i might whether it might
hold<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.579> just<00:03:17.579> not<00:03:17.730> sure<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.120> a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
hold on to it just not sure is a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.060 
hold on to it just not sure is a
nice-looking<00:03:18.420> locomotive<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.709> was<00:03:19.920> great

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
nice-looking locomotive and it was great

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:43.690 
nice-looking locomotive and it was great
with<00:03:20.250> those<00:03:20.370> hoppers<00:03:22.070> go<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.130> come<00:03:23.459> by<00:03:23.670> here

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.850 

so<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.780> guess<00:03:45.050> that's<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.319> biggest<00:03:45.530> change

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
so I guess that's the biggest change

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.250 
so I guess that's the biggest change
that<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.220> have<00:03:46.400> here<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.870> ripped<00:03:47.870> apart<00:03:47.989> my

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
that we have here I ripped apart my

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.530 
that we have here I ripped apart my
sd70ace<00:03:49.239> from<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.629> third<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.879> pulled<00:03:53.239> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
sd70ace from a third and I pulled the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.740 
sd70ace from a third and I pulled the
decoder<00:03:54.349> out<00:03:54.560> here<00:03:54.910> afrin<00:03:55.910> told<00:03:56.150> me<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.420> send

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
decoder out here afrin told me to send

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.420 
decoder out here afrin told me to send
it<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.959> them<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.260> they'll<00:03:57.379> take<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.069> look<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.400> it

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
it to them and they'll take a look at it

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.250 
it to them and they'll take a look at it
and<00:03:58.580> replace<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:58.940> repair<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.019> or<00:04:00.080> whatever

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
and replace it repair it or whatever

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.559 
and replace it repair it or whatever
hopefully<00:04:01.069> though<00:04:01.220> place<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.180> because<00:04:02.480> I

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
hopefully though place it because I

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.820 
hopefully though place it because I
think<00:04:02.630> one<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:02.959> these<00:04:03.110> little<00:04:03.230> tabs<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.800> the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
think one of these little tabs in the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.020 
think one of these little tabs in the
side<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.420> little<00:04:05.540> bit<00:04:05.870> broken<00:04:06.730> I'm<00:04:07.730> try<00:04:07.970> to

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
side is a little bit broken I'm try to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.370 
side is a little bit broken I'm try to
take<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.360> out<00:04:08.450> where<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:08.959> see<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.200> there

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
take it out where you can see it there

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.650 
take it out where you can see it there
but<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:10.580> was<00:04:10.670> shorting<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.060> whole<00:04:11.209> system<00:04:11.390> out

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
but it was shorting the whole system out

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.600 
but it was shorting the whole system out
when<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.959> was<00:04:12.080> given<00:04:12.380> any<00:04:12.799> bit<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.069> forward

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
when it was given any bit of forward

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.469 
when it was given any bit of forward
power<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:15.370> it's<00:04:16.370> broken<00:04:16.700> anyway<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.120> it's<00:04:17.359> got

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
power so it's broken anyway so it's got

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.479 
power so it's broken anyway so it's got
to<00:04:17.570> be<00:04:17.630> replaced<00:04:17.959> so<00:04:18.919> hopefully<00:04:19.250> I'll<00:04:19.370> get

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
to be replaced so hopefully I'll get

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.789 
to be replaced so hopefully I'll get
that<00:04:19.639> done<00:04:19.880> sometime<00:04:20.359> soon<00:04:20.630> but<00:04:20.810> until<00:04:21.290> then

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
that done sometime soon but until then

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.310 
that done sometime soon but until then
that<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.550> all<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.510> thank<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.810> for<00:04:23.960> watching

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
that is all so thank you for watching

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.710

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
and they'll probably be more videos here

on<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.900> future
