00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
facilities and obviously it leaves

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270

the<00:02:08.920> value<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.580> think<00:02:10.209> of<00:02:10.300> unopposed<00:02:10.630> technique

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the value I think of unopposed technique

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.080 
the value I think of unopposed technique
I<00:02:11.500> think<00:02:11.770> with<00:02:11.980> concept<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.520> football<00:02:12.760> coming

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the ability to go on both sides and then

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.660 
the ability to go on both sides and then
taking<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.290> into<00:02:35.530> an<00:02:35.739> opposed<00:02:36.040> situation

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
taking that into an opposed situation

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.790 
taking that into an opposed situation
where<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:36.970> work<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.510> two<00:02:37.780> days<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.020> week<00:02:38.319> thing

lot more technique training and again it

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.650 
lot more technique training and again it
can<00:03:08.830> be<00:03:08.980> more<00:03:09.160> individually<00:03:09.700> based<00:03:09.880> when<00:03:10.630> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
can be more individually based when I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.600 
can be more individually based when I
was<00:03:10.900> training<00:03:11.110> at<00:03:11.380> fulham<00:03:11.709> i<00:03:11.799> started<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:12.220> 11

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
was training at fulham i started at 11

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.550 
was training at fulham i started at 11
and<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.150> was<00:03:13.269> training<00:03:13.630> at<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> school<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.440> know

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
and we was training at a school you know

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.860 
and we was training at a school you know
a<00:03:14.590> comprehensive<00:03:15.400> School<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.850> Putney<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.720> was

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
a comprehensive School in Putney and was

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.509 
a comprehensive School in Putney and was
just<00:03:17.019> on<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> concrete<00:03:17.500> pitch<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.280> really

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
just on a concrete pitch and it really

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.699 
just on a concrete pitch and it really
was<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.820> collective<00:03:19.269> situation<00:03:19.930> whereby<00:03:20.110> they

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
was a collective situation whereby they

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.229 
was a collective situation whereby they
didn't<00:03:21.010> see<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.400> until<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:21.760> were<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:21.970> trial

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
didn't see you until you were in trial

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.240 
didn't see you until you were in trial
games<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.200> think<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.500> kind<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.799> grew<00:03:24.010> up<00:03:24.130> a

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
games but I think you kind of grew up a

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.920 
games but I think you kind of grew up a
lot<00:03:24.340> faster<00:03:24.609> in<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.090> corner<00:03:25.390> football<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
lot faster in that corner football you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.710 
lot faster in that corner football you
learned<00:03:26.140> how<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.950> learn<00:03:27.880> sorry<00:03:28.209> how<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.359> deal

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
learned how to learn sorry how to deal

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.509 
learned how to learn sorry how to deal
with<00:03:28.750> yourself<00:03:29.260> as<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.799> player<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.220> as<00:03:30.459> a

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
with yourself as a player and as a

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.240 
with yourself as a player and as a
person<00:03:30.760> better<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.540> think<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.650> little<00:03:32.920> bit<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
person better I think a little bit of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.440 
person better I think a little bit of
the<00:03:33.310> respect<00:03:33.700> has<00:03:33.850> gone<00:03:34.000> out<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.269> game

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
the respect has gone out of the game

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.840 
the respect has gone out of the game
with<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.660> kids<00:03:34.900> now<00:03:34.959> but<00:03:35.380> what<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.340> see<00:03:36.609> with

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
with the kids now but what I do see with

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.180 
with the kids now but what I do see with
kids<00:03:37.120> is<00:03:37.329> an<00:03:37.480> opportunity<00:03:38.140> now<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.709> way

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
kids is an opportunity now the way

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.770 
kids is an opportunity now the way
they're<00:03:39.340> treated<00:03:39.790> by<00:03:39.910> professional<00:03:40.450> football

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
they're treated by professional football

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.259 
they're treated by professional football
clubs<00:03:40.989> really<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.500> kick<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.920> much<00:03:42.700> further<00:03:43.000> and

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
clubs really to kick on much further and

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.120 
clubs really to kick on much further and
much<00:03:43.390> quicker<00:03:43.720> than<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:44.140> did<00:03:44.320> then<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.890> think

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
much quicker than we did then I think

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.860 
much quicker than we did then I think
that<00:03:45.430> has<00:03:45.609> been<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> great<00:03:46.120> progression<00:03:46.570> in<00:03:46.840> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
that has been a great progression in the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.990 
that has been a great progression in the
professional<00:03:47.440> game<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.950> has<00:03:48.070> been<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.760> one

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
professional game that has been the one

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.819 
professional game that has been the one
thing<00:03:49.359> for<00:03:49.510> me<00:03:49.570> where<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:49.900> thought<00:03:50.140> well<00:03:50.799> I

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
thing for me where I thought well I

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.949 
thing for me where I thought well I
fired<00:03:51.100> her<00:03:51.250> done<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.549> as<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> kid<00:03:51.790> maybe<00:03:52.239> you

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
fired her done that as a kid maybe you

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.420 
fired her done that as a kid maybe you
know<00:03:53.079> my<00:03:53.260> weakness<00:03:53.709> was<00:03:53.920> probably<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.370> I

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
know my weakness was probably that I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.069 
know my weakness was probably that I
wasn't<00:03:54.880> quite<00:03:55.030> quick<00:03:55.420> enough<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:55.989> could

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
wasn't quite quick enough that I could

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.449 
wasn't quite quick enough that I could
have<00:03:56.260> been<00:03:56.380> better<00:03:56.590> in<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:56.890> aspect<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.370> my

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
have been better in that aspect of my

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.220 
have been better in that aspect of my
game<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.940> could<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.450> worked<00:03:58.660> on<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.170> an

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
game I could have worked on that and an

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.069 
game I could have worked on that and an
individual<00:03:59.769> basis<00:04:00.160> pro<00:04:00.850> club<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.359> I<00:04:01.870> think

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
individual basis pro club and I think

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.599 
individual basis pro club and I think
they<00:04:02.170> can<00:04:02.350> be<00:04:02.470> better<00:04:02.739> players<00:04:03.070> because<00:04:03.489> of

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
they can be better players because of

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.430 
they can be better players because of
that<00:04:03.700> now<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.359> all<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.690> really<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.290> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
that now and it's all that really to the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.770 
that now and it's all that really to the
to<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.310> kid<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.970> know<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.359> he's<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.690> his

to the kid you know and he's and his

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.259 
to the kid you know and he's and his
willingness<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.410> work<00:04:08.560> would<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.579> think<00:04:09.730> for

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269
