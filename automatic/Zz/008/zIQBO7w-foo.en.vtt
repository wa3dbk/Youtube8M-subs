why<00:00:14.150> snowfall<00:00:15.150> forecasting<00:00:15.660> is

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
why snowfall forecasting is

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.120 
why snowfall forecasting is
extraordinarily<00:00:16.199> tricky<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.010> difficult

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
extraordinarily tricky and difficult

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.429 
extraordinarily tricky and difficult
with<00:00:18.000> many<00:00:18.240> many<00:00:18.449> variables<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.140> into<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
with many many variables going into the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.630 
with many many variables going into the
equation<00:00:19.920> including<00:00:20.310> how<00:00:20.430> much

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
equation including how much

equation including how much
precipitation<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> fall<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.769> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
precipitation is going to fall which is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.470 
precipitation is going to fall which is
dictated<00:00:23.400> by<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.820> moisture<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.240> the

storm system will have to work with

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
storm system will have to work with
where<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> storm<00:00:26.699> tracks<00:00:27.000> how<00:00:27.240> strong<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
where the storm tracks how strong it

where the storm tracks how strong it
will<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> question<00:00:29.070> comes<00:00:29.480> will<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
will be then the question comes will it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
will be then the question comes will it
even<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.900> cold<00:00:31.140> enough<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.380> snow<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.520> how

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
even be cold enough for snow if so how

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.209 
even be cold enough for snow if so how

look<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.759> ensemble<00:01:36.299> forecasting<00:01:36.509> which<00:01:37.049> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
look at is ensemble forecasting which is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
look at is ensemble forecasting which is
basically<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.710> taking<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> certain<00:01:38.729> model

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
basically just taking a certain model

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
basically just taking a certain model
and<00:01:39.270> tweaking<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.170> conditions<00:01:40.560> vary

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and tweaking the conditions vary

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.319 
and tweaking the conditions vary
slightly<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.430> initial<00:01:41.729> conditions<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
slightly the initial conditions and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
slightly the initial conditions and
running<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.689> over<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> over<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.350> over<00:01:43.439> with

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
running it over and over and over with

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
running it over and over and over with
slight<00:01:44.009> tweaks<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.579> tweaks<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.780> being<00:01:46.020> made

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
slight tweaks the tweaks of being made

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
slight tweaks the tweaks of being made
because<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.130> can't<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.790> have

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
because we really don't can't don't have

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
because we really don't can't don't have
the<00:01:48.149> observation<00:01:49.140> density<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the observation density of the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
the observation density of the
atmosphere<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.939> exactly<00:01:51.450> what's<00:01:51.600> going

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
atmosphere to know exactly what's going

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.539 
atmosphere to know exactly what's going
on<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:52.920> at<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> range<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on so we want to look at the range of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.889 
on so we want to look at the range of
possibilities<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> how<00:01:54.390> something<00:01:54.750> could<00:01:54.840> be

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
possibilities of how something could be

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.539 
possibilities of how something could be
now<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:55.860> you're<00:01:55.979> looking<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> two

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
now what you're looking in the two

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.880 
now what you're looking in the two
yellow<00:01:56.790> lines<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.329> roughly<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> proxy<00:01:58.740> for

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
yellow lines is roughly a proxy for

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.490 
yellow lines is roughly a proxy for
where<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> jet<00:01:59.340> streams<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.899> blue<00:02:01.170> where

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
where the jet streams are the blue where

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.109 
where the jet streams are the blue where
the<00:02:01.680> where<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.369> blue<00:02:02.579> lines<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the where the the blue lines of the

the where the the blue lines of the
different<00:02:03.390> runs<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> northern<00:02:04.229> jet<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
different runs for the northern jet and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.800 
different runs for the northern jet and
the<00:02:05.280> red<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.729> different<00:02:06.360> lines<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the red is the different lines for the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.630 
the red is the different lines for the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
southern jet and one of the things

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
southern jet and one of the things
you'll<00:02:08.910> notice<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.599> out<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.810> time<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you'll notice as you go out in time this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
you'll notice as you go out in time this
is<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.440> initial<00:02:10.619> conditions<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.150> out

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
is the initial conditions as you go out

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.410 
is the initial conditions as you go out
a<00:02:12.330> couple<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.720> days<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.140> know<00:02:13.230> too

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
a couple of days you know too

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.059 
a couple of days you know too
to<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.599> quite<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.990> bit<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.230> spread<00:02:14.530> starts<00:02:14.950> to

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
to get a quite a bit of spread starts to

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.699 
to get a quite a bit of spread starts to
develop<00:02:15.190> by<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.180> time<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.569> get<00:02:16.690> out<00:02:16.870> four

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
develop by the time you get out four

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.729 
develop by the time you get out four
five<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.550> six<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.239> even<00:02:19.630> seven<00:02:20.020> days<00:02:20.200> the

five and six and even seven days the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.470 
five and six and even seven days the
amount<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.099> spread<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:21.819> tremendous<00:02:22.000> to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
amount of spread is just tremendous to

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.030 
amount of spread is just tremendous to
show<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.989> possibilities<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.800> how<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
show that the possibilities of how the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.620 
show that the possibilities of how the

jet stream is going to be we certainly
can't<00:02:32.050> say<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.500> high<00:02:32.650> degree<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.920> certainty

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
can't say for a high degree of certainty

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.340 
can't say for a high degree of certainty
where<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.610> surface<00:02:33.790> low<00:02:34.120> will<00:02:34.270> be<00:02:34.420> how<00:02:34.959> strong

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
where the surface low will be how strong

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.720 
where the surface low will be how strong
will<00:02:35.530> be<00:02:35.620> how<00:02:35.770> much<00:02:35.890> moisture<00:02:36.069> will<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.550> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
will be how much moisture will have and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.699 
will be how much moisture will have and
thus<00:02:36.880> how<00:02:37.060> much<00:02:37.239> snow<00:02:37.360> will<00:02:37.600> fall<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.560> we

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
thus how much snow will fall so we

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.440 
thus how much snow will fall so we
really<00:02:39.040> try<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.250> story<00:02:39.670> straight<00:02:40.090> away<00:02:40.269> from
