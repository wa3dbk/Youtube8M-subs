00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the other closure that I made with a

the other closure that I made with a
three<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.340> three<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.629> type<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
three by three I don't know what type of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.520 
three by three I don't know what type of
hair<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.710> our<00:01:07.950> Jimmy<00:01:08.250> hair<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
hair was but it was our Jimmy hair and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.399 
hair was but it was our Jimmy hair and
this<00:01:10.530> hair<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.420> straighter<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this hair was a little straighter so I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.690 
this hair was a little straighter so I
decided<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.580> permit<00:01:15.380> only<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
decided not to permit only because it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
decided not to permit only because it
was<00:01:17.810> straighter<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.380> West<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.040> didn't

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
was straighter on the West it didn't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
was straighter on the West it didn't
have<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:21.049> curls<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:24.299> other<00:01:24.600> hair

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
have as much curls as that other hair

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.819 
have as much curls as that other hair
was<00:01:25.200> spirally<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.670> why<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:26.970> had<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
was spirally so that's why it had that

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.460 
was spirally so that's why it had that
created<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.119> poof<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> top<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
created that poof up here at the top and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.850 
created that poof up here at the top and
was<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.400> hard<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.170> lay<00:01:34.500> flat

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
was kind of hard to you know lay flat

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
was kind of hard to you know lay flat
was<00:01:35.100> ventilated<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> kept<00:01:36.329> getting<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
was ventilated and kept getting in the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
was ventilated and kept getting in the
way<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.040> caused<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.610> puffiness

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
way and and it caused a puffiness

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.260 
way and and it caused a puffiness
whereas<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.619> still<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> puffing<00:01:42.030> up

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
whereas this is still kind of puffing up

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.499 
whereas this is still kind of puffing up
as<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.909> starting<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
as you can kind of see is starting to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
as you can kind of see is starting to
get<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:47.630> tangled<00:01:48.630> under<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
get a little tangled under there I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.310 
get a little tangled under there I
haven't<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.210> combed<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.140> put

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
haven't even you know combed it or put

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.510 
haven't even you know combed it or put
my<00:01:52.470> hands<00:01:52.950> through<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> comes<00:01:56.189> out

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
my hands through it but it comes out

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.950 
my hands through it but it comes out
pretty<00:01:56.850> easy<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> my<00:01:59.250> opinion<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
pretty easy so my opinion is that it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.800 
pretty easy so my opinion is that it
still<00:02:01.350> may<00:02:01.710> need<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.640> permed<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> roots

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
still may need to be permed in the roots

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
still may need to be permed in the roots
but<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.140> decided<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.740> I'm<00:02:04.979> no<00:02:05.159> longer<00:02:05.189> going

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
but I decided that I'm no longer going

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.570 
but I decided that I'm no longer going
to<00:02:05.990> perm<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.380> Arjuna<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
and that's the hairline that's the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:51.310 
and that's the hairline that's the
inside<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:50.000> what<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.360> looks<00:02:50.570> like<00:02:50.930> up

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
inside and this is what it looks like up

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.930 
inside and this is what it looks like up
close<00:02:51.710> I<00:02:53.200> did<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.440> something<00:02:54.800> different<00:02:55.670> the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
close I did do something different the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.960 
close I did do something different the
only<00:02:56.270> thing<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.600> did<00:02:56.900> as<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.370> wanted<00:02:58.850> to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
only thing I did as you can I wanted to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.170 
only thing I did as you can I wanted to
just<00:02:59.150> show<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.570> it<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.800> free<00:03:01.220> parting<00:03:01.820> but

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
just show you it is free parting but

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.410 
just show you it is free parting but
once<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.570> start<00:03:02.930> pulling<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.070> open<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.910> part<00:03:05.270> it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
once I start pulling it open to part it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.910 
once I start pulling it open to part it
and<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.920> didn't<00:03:07.220> bring<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.460> comb<00:03:07.730> out<00:03:07.970> here

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
and I didn't bring the comb out here

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.190 
and I didn't bring the comb out here
it's<00:03:09.920> going<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.310> start<00:03:10.610> poofing<00:03:11.210> up<00:03:11.420> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
it's going to start poofing up and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.660 
it's going to start poofing up and
that's<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.940> has<00:03:14.210> not<00:03:14.540> been<00:03:15.580> relaxed<00:03:16.580> i

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
that's because it has not been relaxed i

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.230 
that's because it has not been relaxed i
did<00:03:16.850> not<00:03:17.000> relax<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.720> hair<00:03:18.310> but<00:03:19.310> i<00:03:19.340> did<00:03:19.700> decide

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
did not relax the hair but i did decide

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440 
did not relax the hair but i did decide
to<00:03:20.690> go<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.710> trim<00:03:22.070> some<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.550> mustaches

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
to go in and trim some of the mustaches

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.940 
to go in and trim some of the mustaches
the<00:03:23.570> mustaches<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.500> overhang<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:26.950> this

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
the mustaches is the overhang and this

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.720 
the mustaches is the overhang and this
is<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.490> this<00:03:29.270> is<00:03:29.480> what<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.840> did<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.620> went<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.400> I

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
is that this is what I did I went in I

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.390 
is that this is what I did I went in I
brushed<00:03:32.660> out<00:03:32.990> most<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.740> lot<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.310> the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
brushed out most of the a lot of the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.320 
brushed out most of the a lot of the
overhang<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.210> could<00:03:35.510> find<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:38.120> is

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
overhang that I could find and this is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.250 
overhang that I could find and this is
my<00:03:38.510> overhang<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.470> cut<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.570> just<00:03:41.600> wanted<00:03:42.230> to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
my overhang I cut it so I just wanted to

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.380 
my overhang I cut it so I just wanted to
save<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:43.010> show<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:46.130> was<00:03:46.400> super<00:03:47.180> super

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
save it to show you it was super super

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.590 
save it to show you it was super super
puffy<00:03:47.840> that's<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.920> i<00:03:48.950> did<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.430> relax<00:03:50.240> it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
puffy that's because i did not relax it

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.590 
puffy that's because i did not relax it
but<00:03:51.350> as<00:03:51.530> i<00:03:51.770> was<00:03:51.850> ventilating<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.120> as<00:03:53.450> I

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
but as i was ventilating it as I

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.590 
but as i was ventilating it as I
ventilator<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.320> section<00:03:55.030> because<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.270> did<00:03:56.450> all

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
ventilator the section because I did all

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.850 
ventilator the section because I did all
double<00:03:56.960> knot<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.920> kind<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.880> went<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.360> and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
double knot so I kind of went in and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.070 
double knot so I kind of went in and
brushed<00:04:01.120> section<00:04:02.120> by<00:04:02.270> section<00:04:02.300> after<00:04:02.960> I

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
brushed section by section after I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.990 
brushed section by section after I
completed<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.620> section<00:04:04.220> I<00:04:04.340> went<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.730> I

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
completed that section I went in and I

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.270 
completed that section I went in and I
brushed<00:04:05.360> up<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.840> overhangs<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.650> clipped<00:04:07.070> it

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
brushed up the overhangs and clipped it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.110 
brushed up the overhangs and clipped it
so<00:04:08.180> you're<00:04:08.840> getting<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.350> poufiness<00:04:10.120> even

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
so you're getting this poufiness even

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.030 
so you're getting this poufiness even
though<00:04:11.300> now<00:04:11.690> you're<00:04:11.720> overhangs<00:04:12.500> are<00:04:12.770> really

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
though now you're overhangs are really

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.010 
though now you're overhangs are really
super<00:04:13.400> short<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.970> can't<00:04:14.240> see<00:04:14.540> them<00:04:14.660> the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
super short you can't see them the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.550 
super short you can't see them the
poufiness<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.830> still<00:04:16.160> creating<00:04:17.380> because<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
poufiness is still creating because the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.390 
poufiness is still creating because the
hair<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:18.859> not<00:04:19.190> realize

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
hair is not realize

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.620 
hair is not realize
but<00:04:21.400> i'm<00:04:21.519> thinking<00:04:22.180> if<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.410> wear<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.830> flat<00:04:24.220> I'd

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
but i'm thinking if you wear it flat I'd

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.360 
but i'm thinking if you wear it flat I'd
then<00:04:25.630> if<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.990> just<00:04:26.199> flattering<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.919> you

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
then if you just flattering it you

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.850 
then if you just flattering it you
probably<00:04:27.639> won't<00:04:27.910> have<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.120> problem<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:29.020> don't

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
probably won't have that problem I don't

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.100 
probably won't have that problem I don't
know<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.460> don't<00:04:30.669> know<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.570> can<00:04:31.870> actually

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
know I don't know if you can actually

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.080 
know I don't know if you can actually
put<00:04:32.530> heat<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.040> hair<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.610> just<00:04:33.850> I<00:04:34.030> don't
