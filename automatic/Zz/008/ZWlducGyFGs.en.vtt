job<00:03:25.320> I'm<00:03:25.680> serious<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.250> mean<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:27.780> put<00:03:28.049> them<00:03:28.170> in

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
job I'm serious I mean I I put them in

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.440 
job I'm serious I mean I I put them in
my<00:03:28.290> ears<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.830> I'm<00:03:29.100> listening<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.459> music<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.209> I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
my ears and I'm listening to music and I

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.680 
my ears and I'm listening to music and I
can't<00:03:30.810> hear<00:03:31.140> anything<00:03:31.650> at<00:03:32.310> all<00:03:32.670> there's<00:03:33.450> no

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
can't hear anything at all there's no

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.530 
can't hear anything at all there's no
outside<00:03:34.590> sound<00:03:35.070> distracting<00:03:35.880> or<00:03:36.180> taking<00:03:36.510> away

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
outside sound distracting or taking away

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.449 
outside sound distracting or taking away
from<00:03:36.780> music<00:03:37.080> experience<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.620> they<00:03:37.860> work<00:03:38.430> very

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
from music experience so they work very

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.750 
from music experience so they work very
very<00:03:38.880> well<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:41.010> let's<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.370> left<00:03:41.519> in

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
very well for that so let's the left in

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.870 
very well for that so let's the left in
the<00:03:41.820> right<00:03:42.030> when<00:03:42.390> we<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:43.140> have<00:03:43.320> this

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
the right when we actually have this

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.789 
the right when we actually have this
interesting<00:03:44.880> diverted<00:03:45.450> local<00:03:46.140> angular<00:03:46.590> look

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
interesting diverted local angular look

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.530 
interesting diverted local angular look
so<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.549> actually<00:03:47.700> show<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.180> that

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
so if I can actually show you that

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.320 
so if I can actually show you that
properly<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.500> guess<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.640> allows<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.180> go

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
properly I guess this allows you to go

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.020 
properly I guess this allows you to go
into<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.959> ear<00:03:52.200> canal<00:03:52.890> properly<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.880> can

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
into the ear canal properly so you can

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.070 
into the ear canal properly so you can
actually<00:03:54.180> get<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.480> full<00:03:54.810> range<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.680> sound<00:03:57.080> and

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
actually get the full range of sound and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
actually get the full range of sound and
then<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:59.130> course<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.790> pretty

thing<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.470> note<00:04:33.160> as<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.930> looking<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
thing just to note as the looking the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.750 
thing just to note as the looking the
instruction<00:04:35.470> manual<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:36.010> actually<00:04:36.550> has

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
instruction manual and actually has

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.180 
instruction manual and actually has
decimal<00:04:37.720> range<00:04:37.960> which<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.530> actually<00:04:38.860> pretty

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
decimal range which is actually pretty

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.180 
decimal range which is actually pretty
cool<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:40.120> shows<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.600> different<00:04:41.190> limits

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
cool it shows you the different limits

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.660 
cool it shows you the different limits
for<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> english<00:04:42.730> section<00:04:42.970> if<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.900> see<00:04:44.200> that

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
for the english section if you see that

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.930 
for the english section if you see that
shows<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:45.790> different<00:04:46.030> decibel<00:04:46.840> ratings

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
shows you different decibel ratings

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.220 
shows you different decibel ratings
basically<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.120> decimal<00:04:49.510> cell<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.930> how<00:04:50.050> long

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
basically the decimal cell and how long

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.950 
basically the decimal cell and how long
you<00:04:50.410> should<00:04:50.440> listen<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.820> music<00:04:52.540> at<00:04:52.660> the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
you should listen to to music at the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.480 
you should listen to to music at the
decimal<00:04:53.440> rating<00:04:53.710> then<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:53.980> course<00:04:54.160> you<00:04:54.280> know

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
decimal rating then of course you know

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.170 
decimal rating then of course you know
decreases<00:04:54.910> as<00:04:55.300> decibels<00:04:55.870> increase<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:57.180> cool

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
decreases as decibels increase so cool

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.420 
decreases as decibels increase so cool
little<00:04:58.540> thing<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:58.930> mean<00:04:59.110> just<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.620> no<00:04:59.860> not

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
much to see in the instruction model

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.410 
much to see in the instruction model
other<00:05:02.200> than<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:03.130> know<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.370> showing<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:03.880> how
