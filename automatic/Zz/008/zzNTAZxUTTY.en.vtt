00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
with a few days ago and this thing is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.060 
with a few days ago and this thing is
just<00:00:20.369> absolutely<00:00:21.260> tank<00:00:22.260> man<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
just absolutely tank man like I

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.910 
just absolutely tank man like I
absolutely<00:00:23.460> love<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.090> gun<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.500> way<00:00:25.710> how

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
absolutely love this gun so the way how

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.439 
absolutely love this gun so the way how
it<00:00:26.010> acts<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.640> different<00:00:27.000> than<00:00:27.119> any<00:00:27.240> other

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
it acts is very different than any other

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.939 
it acts is very different than any other
so<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> thought<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> would<00:00:28.260> ever<00:00:28.320> use<00:00:28.500> so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
so I thought you would ever use so

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
so I thought you would ever use so
basically<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.580> has<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.119> decent<00:00:30.539> amount<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
basically it has a decent amount of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
basically it has a decent amount of
damage<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:32.250> has<00:00:32.369> very<00:00:32.669> high<00:00:32.850> damage<00:00:33.090> actually

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
damage it has very high damage actually

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
damage it has very high damage actually
and<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.649> decent<00:00:34.950> amount<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> recoil<00:00:35.309> though

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and as decent amount of recoil though

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
and as decent amount of recoil though
the<00:00:35.910> recoil<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> con<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.840> pulls<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> thing

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the recoil is con what pulls this thing

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.690 
the recoil is con what pulls this thing
back<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> definitely<00:00:38.219> recommend<00:00:38.460> using

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
back so I definitely recommend using

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970 
back so I definitely recommend using
grip<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.379> iron<00:00:40.559> sights<00:00:40.800> aren't

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
grip on it and the iron sights aren't

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
grip on it and the iron sights aren't
that<00:00:41.129> good<00:00:41.309> only<00:00:41.610> bad<00:00:41.760> things<00:00:42.000> recoil<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that good only bad things recoil on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.880 
that good only bad things recoil on the
iron<00:00:42.840> sights<00:00:43.110> everything<00:00:43.500> else<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.710> its

game and stuff like that but I just
don't<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> wasn't<00:02:11.700> able<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
don't have it so I wasn't able to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.730 
don't have it so I wasn't able to
experience<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> ak-12

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
