good Gears of War player and that's part

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
good Gears of War player and that's part
of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> reason<00:01:16.590> why<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> little

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of the reason why this game was a little

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
of the reason why this game was a little
bit<00:01:18.450> slow<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.909> anytime<00:01:20.909> I'd

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
bit slow is that I was just anytime I'd

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
bit slow is that I was just anytime I'd
get<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> situation<00:01:21.869> where<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.619> didn't<00:01:23.100> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
get into a situation where I didn't have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
get into a situation where I didn't have
almost<00:01:23.880> every<00:01:24.240> advantage<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.960> say<00:01:25.049> fuck

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
almost every advantage I just say fuck

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.450 
almost every advantage I just say fuck
this<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> run<00:01:25.770> away<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this and run away and that's one of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.609 
this and run away and that's one of
things<00:01:26.610> about<00:01:26.790> Gears<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> War<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:28.259> sort<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
things about Gears of War that's sort of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.399 
things about Gears of War that's sort of
frustrating<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> like

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
frustrating but it's kind of like

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
frustrating but it's kind of like
tactical<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> same<00:01:31.740> time<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
tactical at the same time is that you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080
