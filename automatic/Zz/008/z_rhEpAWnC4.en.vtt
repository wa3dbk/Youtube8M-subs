00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 so hello everyone to another one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.750
 Imagine a new snapshot of this 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.790
 week came snapshot 12 b 42 a and b 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.280
 out and play on 42 even fits the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.039
 level and thus directly displayed with 42 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.109
 So that's not all 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 all came out with this is now the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.650
 pre pre release of the update 1.4 was 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 we come out after that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 Snapshot where I'm on it now 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 sit and give another premiere 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.899
 and then there are already the 1.4 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969
 it would be so against halloween now 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.710
 his 24 october something I have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 not quite the date in your head 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.450
 thus reducing if so had been 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.469
 is soon out so so many 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.969
 There are no changes now 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.940
 it is still a few things made 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.370
 have been a few small changes 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.600
 were made so what quite 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.460
 important is that comes right here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 forming but first times again to the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.050
 back because we are already the last 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 have short employment and indeed 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 the ones you noticed the hoods 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.329
 can do a bit here or something now 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.949
 I've been optimizing that way 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.909
 make a little something else 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 that means she will be something now 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.240
 reasonable displayed when I am now 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 here, for example, way of interest 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 is made pronounce'm sorry it is 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 So pronounced differently with me 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.710
 I net so for example inserts then yes 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.540
 Can you say the same 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 combine decision now 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.049
 but a little bit different 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.220
 the name is displayed or the performance 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.720
 still optimized now note 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.640
 displayed so you can see it better 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.409
 naming and becoming the direct one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 Price displayed a bit different 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.030
 and there you see chest pain of and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:44.729
 resorts 42 aspect 2 plus in sword 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.590
 Station Four gives bay of and resorts 52 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.180
 aspect 2 so that is still the case 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.399
 the costs have been lowered a bit 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.140
 is now needing levels 23 for example 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.329
 Do not believe it and say 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.820
 something completely done and of course I am 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.869
 creative mode remembers and not 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.460
 a thing even if he of course one 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.530
 swears at what you eat is overpowered 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 like that's her age is so awesome 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.380
 sword that I would like to survive 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 mode then you can do this purer and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.000
 for example and when it tries to 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.319
 Do something else too expensive 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.730
 is synonymous if the cost too high 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.810
 that means it does not do it at all 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.340
 can before 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.610
 only question marks what's wrong 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 now why is there okay too expensive 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:26.040
 too expensive to enchant okay I would have 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.420
 said there should be no limit to 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.430
 you have to repair weapons now 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.470
 not again the so difficult 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.030
 for example, but you can pretend 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.709
 then just take difficult and then 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 diamonds accordingly to reinlegen 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.400
 to fix that I do not know now 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.900
 whether it is a diamond or more 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.190
 you would have to try it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.360
 Anyway, you have to put it in the now 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.519
 we do not take raw material with us anymore 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.870
 again a dia sword so if there 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.340
 you can save the material if you 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 just a diamond puts in I hope 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.470
 You can do it this way 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.700
 now you can not test it out here 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.019
 just do not do that here again 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.100
 is too expensive though he does not come 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.150
 it's true because that's not yet 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.400
 maybe you have to hit it 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.810
 but will try otherwise 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.519
 Length when I'm in fashion now 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.080
 that's why it's changing 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.989
 just by the way let yourself 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.599
 surprise and otherwise 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.940
 because of crafting of the anvil here 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.170
 there are a few small changes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.780
 once briefly on her then I take 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.530
 here and bars and normal iron has that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.239
 also changed 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.739
 they wanted a picture a bit 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.790
 make cheaper from the production ago 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.470
 that we have now like this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.940
 you do not need six anymore 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.470
 sorry iron blogs make you 123 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.000
 Then skin then normal 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.299
 iron blogs purely that is the bottom 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.430
 line 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.630
 instead of iron bars or blogs 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.480
 We only have them here now 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.010
 normal tickets so and is yes 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.600
 Actually , those were barren 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.569
 that and blocks on start blocks would have 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.489
 still three way becomes thus cheaper and so 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.150
 now to the actual quite quite 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.220
 very important innovations and indeed 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.970
 redstone yes we can do a lot there 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.889
 make or 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.660
 not too much a thing 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.870
 in any case introduced and indeed electricity 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.549
 clamp or generally where to find the father 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.560
 the first time is permeable to electricity 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.239
 blocking them can like this that they 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.680
 a lock installed as you see yes 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.600
 here as a lever in there because 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.790
 tv format repeater set 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.739
 you know you can but you can diagonally 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.930
 pull in from the signal side 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.850
 In this repeater, that is actually 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.709
 that means blocked when we go to the front 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.269
 example otherwise then the signal remains 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.870
 was also on even male the signal 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.870
 remove 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.870
 that's the way it is 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.970
 then that's still on, even if that 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.830
 it would remain signaled to go out 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.830
 If I do that now, here 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.850
 For example, front is off and then 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.340
 come here now 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.030
 this signal becomes pure from the side 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.430
 cordoned off 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.230
 then there is no other one in the back 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.850
 stream through even if I have it now 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.380
 Turns back here then comes 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.760
 still nothing out further so it 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.070
 practically the world somehow then the 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.750
 condition of the hat he has that is 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.700
 if there is no current flowing right now 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.520
 then comes to them write clamping questioned 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.200
 the jam then and then go 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.310
 Power switched off comes on 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.900
 especially though by if already 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.730
 current flows and then comes the pinch 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.630
 Rhein can go out he stays 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.070
 but still on 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.540
 So for whatever it is 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.270
 Maybe it can be yes 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.170
 useful to point out too 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.170
 not working too well yet 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.450
 but it will be first 1.5 then complete 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.440
 improved as the then or what 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.240
 I am sorry to do it 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.860
 not and otherwise it will be straight 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.780
 at night you can test the following and 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.520
 Although supposedly also again 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.870
 a few songs added 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.660
 that was it in any case 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.950
 I have relation to redstone so far 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.770
 not yet determined where to do that 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.910
 For example, foreign countries can be zombies 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.690
 supposedly have three new sounds 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.680
 to be added 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.330
 the question is only visually already 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.640
 have been released in the snapshot 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.760
 make stand after stand a bit 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.640
 unsure there so the zombies in the moment 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.960
 still somehow you do not hear a big one 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.020
 sometimes differed briefly to full 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.020
 volume 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.979
 i can not do that much higher song 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.449
 should also devote other sounds 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:02.280
 For example, you also have one 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:06.080
 At least I can not 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.080
 Really find out to be honest 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.879
 still as scary as 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.919
 otherwise always young essentials 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.449
 actually already rehearsing 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.009
 what new added there is still one 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.289
 couple so other little finer things 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.500
 but actually irrelevant are how to 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.389
 example something with servers and 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.680
 clients then version vote of the times 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.020
 can see what vision that had 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.460
 that you need everything nice and can 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.110
 you can still read it somewhere then 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.300
 but that's nothing else 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.620
 important more what the games 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.000
 performance or so influenced that was 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.800
 it's essentially repeater now 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.669
 again the change of anvil me 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.020
 I had the video was reasonably 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.819
 helpful that now as I said the 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.810
 pre pre release so much wants 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.860
 not coming anymore or actually 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.680
 will not come now and there it was 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.060
 everything that comes in update 1.4 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.229
 Maybe you have to think about it when I am 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.180
 time I have another video where 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.129
 Everything is summarized 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.550
 innovations in itself everything new to it 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.919
 came 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.180
 since the current version 1.3 of two 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.680
 if it gives time as i will 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.750
 also do so again may 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.120
 then thank you for watching we see 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.379
 We will eventually let's play or 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.379
 elsewhere and shots
