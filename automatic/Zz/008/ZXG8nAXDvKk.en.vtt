me tell you the first trick to finding
fish<00:00:24.540> in<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> reservoir<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.500> lake<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.340> pond<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
fish in a reservoir a lake a pond is to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.389 
fish in a reservoir a lake a pond is to
get<00:00:27.720> off<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.079> bank<00:00:28.290> and<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.950> reason<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
get off the bank and the reason that I

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.220 
get off the bank and the reason that I
say<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.360> majority<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> anglers

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

your fish especially the big fish are

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
your fish especially the big fish are
relating<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.490> some<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.060> structure<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.720> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
of the lake and that's where you're

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.150 
of the lake and that's where you're
gonna<00:00:54.300> find<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.720> big<00:00:54.900> fish<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.470> here's<00:00:55.980> where

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
gonna find the big fish and here's where

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.640 
gonna find the big fish and here's where
you<00:00:56.250> start<00:00:56.390> points<00:00:57.390> every<00:00:57.930> bass<00:00:58.170> fisherman

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
you start points every bass fisherman

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.960 
you start points every bass fisherman
actually<00:00:58.980> every<00:00:59.190> fisherman<00:00:59.490> that's<00:00:59.820> ever

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
actually every fisherman that's ever

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.630 
actually every fisherman that's ever
slung<00:01:00.720> a<00:01:00.750> rod<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.350> heard<00:01:01.560> the<00:01:01.680> term<00:01:01.890> point<00:01:02.190> all

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
slung a rod has heard the term point all

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.999 
slung a rod has heard the term point all
a<00:01:02.700> point<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.870> continuation<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> land

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
a point is is a continuation of the land

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.219 
a point is is a continuation of the land
out<00:01:05.250> into<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> water<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> easiest<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
out into the water it's the easiest to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
out into the water it's the easiest to
find<00:01:07.409> submerged<00:01:08.100> hump<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.119> reason<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
find submerged hump and the reason that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
find submerged hump and the reason that
bass<00:01:09.630> anglers<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.140> relate<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.710> it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
bass anglers will relate to it it's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.530 
bass anglers will relate to it it's
because<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.220> always<00:01:11.340> catch<00:01:11.640> fish<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.119> but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
because they always catch fish there but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
because they always catch fish there but
here's<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.899> deal<00:01:13.079> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.620> want<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.860> find

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
here's the deal if you want to find

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
here's the deal if you want to find
those<00:01:14.250> fish<00:01:14.490> find<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.210> fish<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.479> other

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
those fish find the fish that other

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.210 
those fish find the fish that other
people<00:01:16.080> aren't<00:01:16.200> fine<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> find<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:16.920> big

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
people aren't fine and find those big

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
people aren't fine and find those big
fish<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.880> need<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.120> find<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.450> point<00:01:18.690> that's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
fish you need to find that point that's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.360 
fish you need to find that point that's
underwater<00:01:19.320> or<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> hump

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
underwater or that hump

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.430 
underwater or that hump
that's<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.760> shore<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.780> easy<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.229> do

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
that's all shore now an easy way to do

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.380 
that's all shore now an easy way to do
that<00:01:22.470> especially<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.610> way<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.760> fish<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.300> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that especially the way I fish with the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.180 
that especially the way I fish with the
kayak<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.260> simply<00:01:25.560> set<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:26.010> depth

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
kayak is to simply set up your depth

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.880 
kayak is to simply set up your depth
finder<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> water<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> paddle

finder get out in the water and paddle

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.140 
finder get out in the water and paddle
and<00:01:29.010> paddle<00:01:29.370> like<00:01:29.640> you're<00:01:29.790> cutting<00:01:30.090> your

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and paddle like you're cutting your

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.670 
and paddle like you're cutting your
grass<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.630> basically<00:01:30.960> start<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> grid

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
grass you basically start in a grid

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
grass you basically start in a grid
pattern<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.190> you<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.760> back<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.090> forth

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
pattern and you just go back and forth

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
pattern and you just go back and forth
looking<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.140> contour<00:01:34.830> changes<00:01:35.280> looking<00:01:35.790> for

looking for contour changes looking for

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
looking for contour changes looking for
depth<00:01:36.180> changes<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.930> more<00:01:37.049> importantly

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
depth changes but more importantly

looking for that line to come up level
off<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.080> then<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.010> that's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
off and then go back down and that's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.250 
off and then go back down and that's
letting<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.940> know<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.510> there<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> hump<00:01:43.140> in
