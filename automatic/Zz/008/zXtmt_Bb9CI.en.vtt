like<00:01:52.080> if<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:52.410> have<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> background<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.399> your

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
like if you have a background on your

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
like if you have a background on your
springboard<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.800> if<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
springboard like I do if you have a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.480 
springboard like I do if you have a
black<00:01:57.470> background<00:01:58.470> then<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.280> need

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
black background then you don't need

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.300 
black background then you don't need
that<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.410> background<00:02:01.710> turn

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that so if you have a background turn

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.660 
that so if you have a background turn
that<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.869> background<00:02:03.869> behavior<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:05.160> rotate

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that on background behavior I put rotate

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.700 
that on background behavior I put rotate
and<00:02:05.910> zoom<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.660> that's<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.929> best<00:02:07.140> one

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.010 

icons<00:02:10.710> behavior<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.550> put<00:02:11.819> seventy<00:02:12.360> percent<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
icons behavior I put seventy percent and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.580 
icons behavior I put seventy percent and
doc<00:02:13.350> eighty<00:02:13.710> percent<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> once<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.230> get<00:02:16.440> those

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
doc eighty percent so once you get those

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.980 
doc eighty percent so once you get those
click<00:02:17.270> we<00:02:18.270> cater<00:02:18.480> I'll<00:02:18.660> take<00:02:18.840> your

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
click we cater I'll take your

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.980 
click we cater I'll take your
springboard<00:02:20.090> which<00:02:21.090> i<00:02:21.240> think<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.569> really<00:02:21.930> cool

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
springboard which i think is really cool

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
springboard which i think is really cool
but<00:02:24.990> keep<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.319> mind<00:02:26.960> it<00:02:27.960> just<00:02:28.020> rotates<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
but keep in mind it just rotates the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.860 
but keep in mind it just rotates the
springboard<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.700> will<00:02:29.819> not<00:02:30.030> rotate<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.630> apps

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
springboard it will not rotate the apps

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.340 
springboard it will not rotate the apps
like<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.860> instance<00:02:32.360> well<00:02:33.360> no<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
like for instance well no that's the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.850 
like for instance well no that's the
landscape<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:35.959> for<00:02:36.959> instance<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.560> i<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.830> to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
landscape like for instance if i go to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.760 
landscape like for instance if i go to
clock<00:02:38.340> app<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.880> does<00:02:39.240> not<00:02:39.480> rotate<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.470> just

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
clock app it does not rotate it it just

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.640 
clock app it does not rotate it it just
rotates<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.310> springboard<00:02:41.880> itself<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:43.410> just

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
rotates the springboard itself so just

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.740 
rotates the springboard itself so just
to<00:02:43.770> keep<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.130> guys<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.450> let<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.720> guys
