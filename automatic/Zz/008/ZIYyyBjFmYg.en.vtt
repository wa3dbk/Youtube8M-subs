spinning<00:02:47.360> faster<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.140> faster<00:02:48.350> as<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.830> gets

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
spinning faster and faster as it gets

closer into the black hole when two

closer into the black hole when two
black<00:02:51.560> holes<00:02:51.770> merge<00:02:52.400> all<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.720> rotation

black holes merge all of that rotation

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.630 
black holes merge all of that rotation
will<00:02:55.160> end<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.200> single<00:02:57.620> object<00:02:57.860> making<00:02:58.520> it

spin very fast a new star is going to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.980 
spin very fast a new star is going to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
measure how fast black holes are

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.630 
measure how fast black holes are
spinning<00:03:03.470> which<00:03:04.100> gives<00:03:04.340> us<00:03:04.430> information

spinning which gives us information

about<00:03:05.330> how<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.020> black<00:03:06.320> hole's<00:03:06.590> form<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.340> what

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
about how the black hole's form and what

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.000 
about how the black hole's form and what
role<00:03:08.209> they<00:03:08.239> play<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.350> formation<00:03:09.650> of

role they play in the formation of
galaxies<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.410> think<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.590> me<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.160> most

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
galaxies I think for me the most

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.699 
galaxies I think for me the most
exciting<00:03:13.970> thing<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.320> new

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
exciting thing is to have this new

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.870 
exciting thing is to have this new
window<00:03:16.100> on<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.519> universe<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:18.080> enables

window on the universe it enables

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.370 
window on the universe it enables
astrophysicists<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.450> study<00:03:20.900> some<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.260> the

astrophysicists to study some of the
