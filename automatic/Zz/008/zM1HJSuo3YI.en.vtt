 good as they say 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.710
 well what do you think if we start with the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.869
 interview seems perfect well 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.780
 first question when did you start 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.850
 with the videos of gta iv loquendo 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.399
 I've been quite happy for over a year 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.440
 write stories and by that time I had 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.930
 some already and fantasized about doing them 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.360
 reality and then with the gta san andreas and 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.520
 the loquendo I saw the great opportunity 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.020
 good second question do you have any 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.959
 target with your videos 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.110
 my goal is to see all the series that 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.000
 I have started finished and improve every day 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.739
 Good if you want to keep improving not 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.319
 I think someone can beat you in 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.739
 this haha third question time video what 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.019
 that no of beginners if I try to see 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.940
 many videos of gta since people who 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.430
 just started now it's very good 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.290
 making videos but nobody knows them and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.540
 if I like your videos and the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.209
 I recommend that people can enjoy 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.910
 of his series also good I think 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.670
 well let's continue to admire some user of 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.860
 youtube I use loquendo as cf1 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.799
 Gta does a great job with its 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.850
 videos and handle the loquendo very well 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.430
 fifth question 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.550
 your videos what is your favorite the one of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.170
 myths of the night paranormal activity 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.870
 you're right that episode is pretty 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.600
 long and catchy let's say that channels 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.090
 would you recommend to those who are subscribed 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.800
 seventh question what do you think of the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.980
 trolleys that nowadays there are 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.530
 more then hopefully hopefully disappear 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.210
 eighth you plan to continue taking out 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.300
 series apart from those already promoted 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.860
 with the gta 4 when I finish those that 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.130

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.220

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.540
 will leave sen loquendo not the truth is that 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.450
 I still really want to continue 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.550
 making videos well from a question 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.610

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.090
