and really try to fight the temptation

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.430 
and really try to fight the temptation
of<00:03:03.020> rubbing<00:03:03.530> your<00:03:03.620> lips<00:03:03.830> together<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:05.440> notice

have a lot of wrinkles and fine lines it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.390 
have a lot of wrinkles and fine lines it
actually<00:03:12.140> works<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.470> my<00:03:12.650> advantage<00:03:12.680> because

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
actually works to my advantage because

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.270 
actually works to my advantage because
the<00:03:14.000> lip<00:03:14.209> tint<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.560> bleeding<00:03:16.040> through

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the lip tint is kind of bleeding through

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.000 
the lip tint is kind of bleeding through
those<00:03:17.060> lines<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.320> creates<00:03:18.650> more<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.950> a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
those lines and that creates more of a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.860 
those lines and that creates more of a
natural<00:03:19.459> look<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:26.030> blend<00:03:26.330> away<00:03:26.480> with

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
natural look and just blend away with

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.390 
natural look and just blend away with
your<00:03:27.019> fingers<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.410> said<00:03:30.650> before<00:03:30.830> the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
your fingers and like I said before the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.430 
your fingers and like I said before the
color<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.880> very<00:03:32.150> blendable<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:32.959> if<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.230> do

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
color is very blendable so if you do

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.650 
color is very blendable so if you do
want<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.739> darker<00:03:34.130> effect<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:35.269> put<00:03:35.450> some<00:03:35.630> more
