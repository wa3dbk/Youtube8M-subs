much information is actually there it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
much information is actually there it
looks<00:00:34.559> pretty<00:00:34.820> white<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.030> something<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
looks pretty white if something is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
looks pretty white if something is
completely<00:00:36.630> 100%<00:00:37.350> white<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.430> can't<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.879> much

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
completely 100% white you can't do much

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
completely 100% white you can't do much
with<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.629> there's<00:00:39.840> shades<00:00:40.290> within<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
with it if there's shades within that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
with it if there's shades within that
white<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.410> bring<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
white then we can then we can bring it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.020 
white then we can then we can bring it
back<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.010> let<00:00:44.129> me<00:00:44.190> show<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.820> quick

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
tip this takes literally 30 seconds so

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
tip this takes literally 30 seconds so
take<00:00:47.820> coming<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> layers<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.050> drag

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
take coming on the layers I'm gonna drag

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.869 
take coming on the layers I'm gonna drag
it<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> new<00:00:50.160> layer<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> got

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it make a new layer out of it so I got

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
it make a new layer out of it so I got
two<00:00:51.030> layers<00:00:51.210> I'm<00:00:51.989> gonna<00:00:52.140> change<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.590> blending

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
two layers I'm gonna change the blending

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.900 
two layers I'm gonna change the blending
option<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.590> multiply<00:00:55.590> look<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.670> we've

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
option to multiply look at that we've

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
option to multiply look at that we've
already<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.420> color<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:58.199> still

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
already got more color it's still

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
already got more color it's still
slightly<00:00:58.800> overexposed<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.670> think<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.030> I'm

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
slightly overexposed I think so I'm

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.959 
slightly overexposed I think so I'm
gonna<00:01:00.239> duplicate<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.260> layer<00:01:01.320> again<00:01:01.969> okay

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
gonna duplicate that layer again okay

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
gonna duplicate that layer again okay
now<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.629> strong<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> second

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
now it's a little strong so the second

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
now it's a little strong so the second
layer<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> made<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.180> gonna<00:01:06.270> drop

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
layer that I made I'm just gonna drop

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.570 
layer that I made I'm just gonna drop
the<00:01:06.659> opacity<00:01:06.950> until<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.280> happy<00:01:08.460> with

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
the picture was a little too overexposed

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.120 
the picture was a little too overexposed
okay<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.619> thing<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:40.979> do

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
okay but one more thing we can do

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
okay but one more thing we can do
because<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.899> more

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
because the more you do this the more

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
because the more you do this the more
you<00:01:43.170> add<00:01:43.439> layers<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> multiply<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you add layers and put on a multiply and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.359 
you add layers and put on a multiply and
add<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> curves<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.560> tend<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> saturate<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
add a curves you tend to saturate the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
add a curves you tend to saturate the
colors<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.909> last<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.720> come

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
colors the last thing we can do come

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.660 
colors the last thing we can do come
here<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> adjustment<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.220> add<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> hue<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
here to adjustment and add a hue and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.609 
here to adjustment and add a hue and
saturation<00:01:50.930> we're<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.079> gonna<00:01:52.170> drop<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
saturation we're just gonna drop the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
saturation we're just gonna drop the
saturation<00:01:52.799> down<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:53.850> bit

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
saturation down a little bit

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700 
saturation down a little bit
cuz<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.899> his<00:01:54.990> priest<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.749 
you look back at the original photo
that's<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.829> started<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.219> us<00:02:05.399> that's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that's what we started with us that's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
that's what we started with us that's
what<00:02:05.880> came<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> camera<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.380> we

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
what came right out of the camera and we

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.309 
what came right out of the camera and we
bring<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> perfect

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
bring it to this so not a not a perfect

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.510 
bring it to this so not a not a perfect
picture<00:02:10.679> obviously<00:02:10.800> there's<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> lot<00:02:11.310> more<00:02:11.459> I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
picture obviously there's a lot more I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
picture obviously there's a lot more I
could<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> retouch<00:02:12.450> this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
could do to retouch this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.920 
could do to retouch this
but<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:14.610> fairly<00:02:15.060> good<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.450> we've

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
but you know fairly good and we've

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.910 
but you know fairly good and we've
pretty<00:02:16.080> much<00:02:16.200> saved

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
pretty much saved

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.060 
pretty much saved
I<00:02:16.950> think<00:02:17.370> we've<00:02:17.490> saved<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.000> photograph<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
I think we've saved this photograph and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.760 
I think we've saved this photograph and
it's<00:02:20.070> not<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.670> need<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.970> delete<00:02:21.770> ok

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
