00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
high cadence maybe 80 to 90 rpms get

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.000 
high cadence maybe 80 to 90 rpms get
everything<00:00:57.539> loosened<00:00:58.049> up<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.409> then<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:58.979> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
everything loosened up and then you do a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
everything loosened up and then you do a
few<00:00:59.280> openers<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.909> few<00:01:00.329> hard<00:01:00.569> thirty-second

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
few openers a few hard thirty-second

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.070 
few openers a few hard thirty-second
reps<00:01:01.559> where<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> build<00:01:02.459> heart<00:01:02.729> rate<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.239> get

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
reps where you build heart rate up get

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.870 
reps where you build heart rate up get
up<00:01:04.140> towards<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.769> lactate<00:01:05.190> threshold<00:01:05.220> heart

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
up towards that lactate threshold heart

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.690 
up towards that lactate threshold heart
rate<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.300> get<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.780> power<00:01:07.560> zone<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.310> above

your<00:01:08.880> functional<00:01:09.270> threshold<00:01:09.750> power<00:01:09.960> then

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
your functional threshold power then

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.900 
your functional threshold power then
you're<00:01:10.860> ready<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.160> your<00:01:11.370> he'll<00:01:11.550> repeat

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
you're ready for your he'll repeat

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.060 
you're ready for your he'll repeat
workout<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> find<00:01:13.230> a<00:01:13.350> hill<00:01:13.560> let's<00:01:13.920> say

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
workout so you find a hill let's say

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
workout so you find a hill let's say
anywhere<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.490> six<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> ten<00:01:15.270> percent<00:01:15.480> great

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
anywhere from six to ten percent great

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.900 
anywhere from six to ten percent great
it's<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.010> anywhere<00:01:17.400> from<00:01:17.460> two<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
it's going to take anywhere from two to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.950 
it's going to take anywhere from two to
three<00:01:18.270> minutes<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.170> climb<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.330> start<00:01:21.690> off

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
three minutes to climb and you start off

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.220 
three minutes to climb and you start off
earlier<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.070> season<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.820> say<00:01:24.150> four<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
earlier in the season with say four to

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.470 
earlier in the season with say four to
six<00:01:25.620> he'll<00:01:26.160> repeat<00:01:26.610> efforts<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
six he'll repeat efforts because if you

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.240 
six he'll repeat efforts because if you
do<00:01:27.660> these<00:01:27.810> right<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.830> not<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.160> be

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
do these right you're not going to be

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.650 
do these right you're not going to be
able<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> handle<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:29.910> more<00:01:30.060> than<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.480> so

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
able to handle a lot more than that so

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.750 
able to handle a lot more than that so
you<00:01:30.690> start<00:01:31.020> off<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.230> four<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> six<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.220> then

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
you start off with four to six and then

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.850 
you start off with four to six and then
every<00:01:33.240> week<00:01:33.510> or<00:01:33.750> every<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.990> weeks<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.590> try<00:01:34.800> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
every week or every two weeks you try to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
every week or every two weeks you try to
add<00:01:35.070> another<00:01:35.580> repetition<00:01:35.930> until<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.050> get<00:01:37.230> up

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
add another repetition until you get up

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.160 
add another repetition until you get up
to<00:01:37.530> maybe<00:01:37.740> say<00:01:38.070> 10<00:01:38.700> maybe<00:01:39.240> even<00:01:39.390> 12<00:01:39.780> reps

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
to maybe say 10 maybe even 12 reps

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
to maybe say 10 maybe even 12 reps
depending<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.010> your<00:01:41.190> level<00:01:41.370> of<00:01:41.580> experience

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
depending on your level of experience

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
depending on your level of experience
but<00:01:42.600> again<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.170> these<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
but again if you do these right you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
but again if you do these right you
don't<00:01:43.920> need<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.190> lot<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.030> need<00:01:45.210> very<00:01:45.390> few

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
don't need a lot you need very few

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
don't need a lot you need very few
because<00:01:46.140> they'll<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.950> break<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.460> down

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
because they'll really break you down

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.570 
because they'll really break you down
and<00:01:48.000> help<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.720> stronger<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> start

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
and help you get stronger so you start

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.460 
and help you get stronger so you start
at<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.730> bottom<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.510> do<00:01:51.690> your<00:01:51.840> reps<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
at the bottom you do your reps a it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
at the bottom you do your reps a it
takes<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.830> two<00:01:53.010> minutes<00:01:53.190> as<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
takes you two minutes as you get to the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
takes you two minutes as you get to the
top<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.050> turn<00:01:55.260> around<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.950> roll<00:01:56.159> right

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
top you turn around and you roll right
