grants cosmic energy and it has special

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.300 
grants cosmic energy and it has special
functionality<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.230> may<00:01:17.380> not<00:01:17.410> be<00:01:17.620> activated

manually<00:01:18.670> what<00:01:19.480> this<00:01:19.660> means<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.110> it's<00:01:20.320> perfect

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
manually what this means is it's perfect

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.910 
manually what this means is it's perfect
for<00:01:20.860> defense<00:01:21.400> it's<00:01:22.150> idiot-proof<00:01:22.690> they<00:01:23.620> can't

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
for defense it's idiot-proof they can't

possibly use it it just activates by
itself<00:01:27.120> it's<00:01:28.120> probably<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.900> most<00:01:29.050> perfect

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680

list<00:02:02.680> goes<00:02:02.860> on<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.520> item<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.940> just

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
list goes on this item is just

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
it seems like it's practically a one

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.430 
it seems like it's practically a one
hundred<00:02:09.250> percent<00:02:09.280> proc<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.629> there<00:02:10.810> goes<00:02:11.019> first

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
hundred percent proc so there goes first

on<00:03:30.570> true<00:03:30.780> events<00:03:31.370> seriously<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.490> feels<00:03:32.700> like

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
on true events seriously it feels like

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.460 
on true events seriously it feels like
my<00:03:33.030> enemies<00:03:33.360> are<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.630> horror<00:03:33.870> movie<00:03:33.960> and

my enemies are in a horror movie and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.070 
my enemies are in a horror movie and
this<00:03:35.190> one<00:03:35.400> we're<00:03:35.550> facing<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:36.060> warriors<00:03:36.420> 3<00:03:36.810> team

this one we're facing a warriors 3 team
and<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.980> means<00:03:38.190> Fandral<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.940> an<00:03:39.210> infiltrator

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
and that means Fandral is an infiltrator

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.880 
and that means Fandral is an infiltrator
so<00:03:39.900> he's<00:03:40.050> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.230> get<00:03:40.350> destroyed<00:03:40.830> by

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
now but at the same time I'm kind of

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.110

happy that all the people who had it

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.670 
happy that all the people who had it
before<00:04:18.270> are<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.020> get<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.140> taste<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.560> their

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.130 
own medicine I'm just being honest well
Fandral<00:04:23.640> does<00:04:23.850> get<00:04:24.060> pretty<00:04:24.090> lucky<00:04:24.690> there<00:04:24.900> but

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
Fandral does get pretty lucky there but

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.710 
Fandral does get pretty lucky there but
we're<00:04:25.290> not<00:04:25.470> even<00:04:25.620> finished<00:04:26.300> okay<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:27.360> he<00:04:27.570> got

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
we're not even finished okay so he got

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.320 
we're not even finished okay so he got
another<00:04:27.990> dodge<00:04:28.290> from<00:04:28.590> reality<00:04:29.010> hacking<00:04:29.400> but<00:04:30.270> I

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
another dodge from reality hacking but I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.969 
another dodge from reality hacking but I
believe<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.840> blinding<00:04:31.320> punches<00:04:31.770> will

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
believe this blinding punches will

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.140 
believe this blinding punches will
finish<00:04:32.250> him

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
finish him

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.290 
finish him
and<00:04:33.240> we<00:04:33.450> once<00:04:33.690> again<00:04:33.810> get<00:04:34.140> another<00:04:34.380> tag<00:04:34.680> team<00:04:34.980> I

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
and we once again get another tag team I

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.670 
and we once again get another tag team I
guess<00:04:36.300> in<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.570> second<00:04:37.050> match<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.350> enemy<00:04:37.620> is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
guess in the second match the enemy is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.710 
guess in the second match the enemy is
actually<00:04:38.010> going<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.280> get<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> turn<00:04:38.730> so<00:04:39.450> we<00:04:39.600> are

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
actually going to get a turn so we are

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.110 
actually going to get a turn so we are
going<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.960> see<00:04:40.080> Bowl<00:04:40.320> stag<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.860> something<00:04:41.310> I'm

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
going to see Bowl stag do something I'm

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.910 
going to see Bowl stag do something I'm
kind<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.510> hoping<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:42.990> he<00:04:43.080> doesn't<00:04:43.320> use<00:04:43.590> guard

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
kind of hoping that he doesn't use guard

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.710 
kind of hoping that he doesn't use guard
the<00:04:44.100> rear<00:04:44.280> because<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.730> don't<00:04:44.970> want<00:04:45.030> my<00:04:45.240> damage

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
the rear because I don't want my damage

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.200 
the rear because I don't want my damage
reduced<00:04:46.370> okay<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.430> let's<00:04:47.790> see<00:04:47.970> what<00:04:48.120> he's

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
reduced okay so let's see what he's

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.540 
reduced okay so let's see what he's
going<00:04:48.420> to<00:04:48.450> do<00:04:48.660> he<00:04:49.590> uses<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.100> elixir<00:04:50.490> of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
going to do he uses the elixir of

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.390 
going to do he uses the elixir of
recovery<00:04:51.000> which<00:04:51.960> also<00:04:52.230> causes<00:04:52.590> their<00:04:52.950> agent

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
recovery which also causes their agent

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.910 
recovery which also causes their agent
to<00:04:53.460> drink<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:54.000> have<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.080> say<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:55.380> seeing<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.740> lot

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
to drink I have to say I'm seeing a lot

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.400 
to drink I have to say I'm seeing a lot
of<00:04:55.950> agents<00:04:56.370> with<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.640> Asgardian<00:04:57.240> tankard<00:04:57.720> but

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
of agents with the Asgardian tankard but

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.780 
of agents with the Asgardian tankard but
I<00:04:58.440> don't<00:04:58.710> understand<00:04:59.220> why<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.490> use<00:04:59.760> a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
I don't understand why you use a

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.510 
I don't understand why you use a
generalist<00:05:00.450> armor<00:05:00.840> with<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.170> in<00:05:01.320> my<00:05:02.010> opinion

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
generalist armor with it in my opinion

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.010 
generalist armor with it in my opinion
you're<00:05:02.760> kind<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.120> missing<00:05:03.300> out<00:05:03.600> if<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.870> do

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
you're kind of missing out if you do

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.190 
you're kind of missing out if you do
that<00:05:04.520> union<00:05:05.520> jacks<00:05:05.730> be<00:05:06.060> for<00:05:06.330> victory<00:05:06.690> didn't

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
that union jacks be for victory didn't

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.570 
that union jacks be for victory didn't
quite<00:05:07.410> kill<00:05:07.740> her<00:05:07.920> so<00:05:08.100> we're<00:05:08.250> going<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.430> have<00:05:08.520> to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
quite kill her so we're going to have to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.330 
quite kill her so we're going to have to
use<00:05:08.730> another<00:05:09.060> attack<00:05:09.620> but<00:05:10.620> then<00:05:10.770> we<00:05:10.950> do<00:05:11.130> get

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
use another attack but then we do get

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.220 
use another attack but then we do get
our<00:05:11.460> agent<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.030> Quicksilver<00:05:12.870> with<00:05:13.020> two

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
our agent and Quicksilver with two

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.010 
our agent and Quicksilver with two
attacks<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.800> finish<00:05:14.130> Volstagg<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:15.750> means

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
attacks to finish Volstagg that means

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.230 
attacks to finish Volstagg that means
that<00:05:16.230> in<00:05:16.380> two<00:05:16.620> matches<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.400> enemy<00:05:17.700> only<00:05:18.030> got

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
that in two matches the enemy only got

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.990 
that in two matches the enemy only got
one<00:05:18.570> action<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:20.070> really<00:05:20.550> is<00:05:20.670> pretty

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
one action that really is pretty

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.050 
one action that really is pretty
impressive<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:22.010> look<00:05:23.010> cosmic<00:05:23.490> Cardinal<00:05:23.910> was

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
impressive and look cosmic Cardinal was

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.600 
impressive and look cosmic Cardinal was
going<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.360> proc<00:05:24.600> once<00:05:24.930> again<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.920> procs<00:05:26.370> all

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
going to proc once again it procs all

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.940 
going to proc once again it procs all
the<00:05:26.880> time<00:05:27.120> on<00:05:27.300> offense<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.960> for<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.530> AI<00:05:28.710> it

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
the time on offense and for the AI it

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.610 
the time on offense and for the AI it
seems<00:05:29.400> like<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:29.760> guaranteed<00:05:30.410> after<00:05:31.410> using

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
seems like it's guaranteed after using

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.140 
seems like it's guaranteed after using
the<00:05:31.860> neuro<00:05:32.010> trope<00:05:32.400> I'm<00:05:32.580> going<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:32.880> use<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
the neuro trope I'm going to use the

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.720 
the neuro trope I'm going to use the
Dragons<00:05:33.570> foot<00:05:33.780> on<00:05:33.930> volstagg<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.800> like<00:05:35.550> i<00:05:35.670> said

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
Dragons foot on volstagg and like i said

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.750 
Dragons foot on volstagg and like i said
before<00:05:36.030> hopefully<00:05:36.540> we<00:05:36.840> get<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.020> follow<00:05:37.440> up

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
before hopefully we get that follow up

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.910 
before hopefully we get that follow up
if<00:05:38.760> not<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:39.480> looks<00:05:39.690> like<00:05:39.840> we<00:05:40.020> won't<00:05:40.320> it's

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
if not and it looks like we won't it's

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.380 
if not and it looks like we won't it's
going<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.190> be<00:05:41.280> up<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.400> Quicksilver<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.210> I'm

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
going to be up to Quicksilver and I'm

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.200 
going to be up to Quicksilver and I'm
pretty<00:05:42.660> sure<00:05:42.900> he's<00:05:42.930> going<00:05:43.230> to<00:05:43.290> do<00:05:43.470> this<00:05:43.650> easily

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
pretty sure he's going to do this easily

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.310 
pretty sure he's going to do this easily
so<00:05:45.210> that's<00:05:45.360> pretty<00:05:45.660> much<00:05:45.840> going<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.080> be<00:05:46.140> it<00:05:46.290> for

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
so that's pretty much going to be it for

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.170 
so that's pretty much going to be it for
our<00:05:46.590> first<00:05:46.890> look<00:05:47.070> at<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.310> cosmic<00:05:47.760> cardinal

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
our first look at the cosmic cardinal

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.720 
our first look at the cosmic cardinal
and<00:05:48.360> whether<00:05:48.870> or<00:05:49.080> not<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.380> should<00:05:49.410> buy<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:49.770> the

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
and whether or not you should buy it the

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.790 
and whether or not you should buy it the
answer<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.090> course<00:05:51.240> is<00:05:51.660> yes<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.230> if<00:05:52.440> you<00:05:52.590> do

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
answer of course is yes and if you do

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.680 
answer of course is yes and if you do
miss<00:05:53.010> it<00:05:53.040> you'll<00:05:53.430> probably<00:05:53.730> kick<00:05:54.240> yourself

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
miss it you'll probably kick yourself

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.500 
miss it you'll probably kick yourself
that's<00:05:55.350> at<00:05:55.560> least<00:05:55.590> what<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:55.980> did<00:05:56.250> last<00:05:56.460> time<00:05:56.790> but

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
that's at least what I did last time but

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.850 
that's at least what I did last time but
anyways<00:05:57.870> that's<00:05:58.170> going<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.410> be<00:05:58.500> it<00:05:58.590> for<00:05:58.620> this

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
anyways that's going to be it for this

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.650 
anyways that's going to be it for this
quick<00:05:59.280> look<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.790> I<00:06:00.060> wanted<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.390> get<00:06:00.480> this

quick look and I wanted to get this

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.110 
quick look and I wanted to get this
