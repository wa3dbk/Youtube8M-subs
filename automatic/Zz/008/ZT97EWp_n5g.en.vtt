00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
more that goes beyond language even it's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.930 
more that goes beyond language even it's
much<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:43.250> maybe<00:00:44.250> sometimes<00:00:44.730> it's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
much more of a maybe sometimes it's

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.439

beauty to the stage when that me Marcus
and<00:01:23.409> thought<00:01:24.340> well<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:24.790> could<00:01:25.510> be<00:01:25.630> possible

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
and thought well this could be possible

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.740 
and thought well this could be possible
using<00:01:26.530> photographs<00:01:27.490> which<00:01:28.030> was<00:01:28.300> really<00:01:28.630> an

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
using photographs which was really an

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.350 
using photographs which was really an

you're thinking musically about

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.330 
you're thinking musically about
photographs<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:38.409> amazing<00:01:38.680> how<00:01:38.950> different

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
photographs it's amazing how different

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.219 
photographs it's amazing how different
elements<00:01:39.910> come<00:01:40.090> out<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.630> don't<00:01:40.720> expect

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
elements come out that you don't expect

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.170 
elements come out that you don't expect
we<00:01:41.500> start<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.800> see<00:01:41.860> line<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.670> photograph

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
we start to see line in the photograph

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.390 
we start to see line in the photograph
we<00:01:43.780> start<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.140> see<00:01:44.170> texture<00:01:44.800> in<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.009> different

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
we start to see texture in a different

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.230 
we start to see texture in a different
way<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.130> surprising<00:01:48.700> how<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:48.940> can

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
way it's a surprising how you can

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.940 
way it's a surprising how you can
actually<00:01:49.390> line<00:01:49.810> up<00:01:49.840> photographs<00:01:50.350> with

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
actually line up photographs with

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.190 
actually line up photographs with
specific<00:01:51.400> textures<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.210> lines<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.750> music

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
specific textures and lines in the music

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.820 
specific textures and lines in the music
I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.539> was<00:01:56.020> thinking<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.560> little<00:01:56.680> bit

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
I think I was thinking a little bit

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.520 
I think I was thinking a little bit
about<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:58.210> idea<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.750> having<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.200> intense

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
about this idea of having an intense

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.859 
about this idea of having an intense
listening<00:02:00.160> experience<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.270> think<00:02:01.600> that

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
listening experience and I think that

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.650 
listening experience and I think that
classical<00:02:02.590> music<00:02:02.979> people<00:02:03.970> feel<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.210> little<00:02:04.420> bit

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
classical music people feel a little bit

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.740 
classical music people feel a little bit
on<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.020> outside<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:07.210> thought<00:02:07.420> well<00:02:07.600> what

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
on the outside and I thought well what

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.600 
on the outside and I thought well what
if<00:02:07.899> there<00:02:08.140> was<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.350> way<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.649> make<00:02:09.009> people<00:02:09.220> feel

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
if there was a way to make people feel

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.090 
if there was a way to make people feel
more<00:02:09.640> welcome<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.600> situation<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.530> one

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
more welcome in the situation and one

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.770 
more welcome in the situation and one
way<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.310> do<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.940> add<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.270> visual

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
way to do that is to add a visual

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.910 
way to do that is to add a visual
element<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.750> think<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.350> began<00:02:17.709> to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
element to it so I think then I began to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.030 
element to it so I think then I began to
realize<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:19.360> was<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> way<00:02:20.050> for<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.560> see

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
realize that it was a way for you to see

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.570 
realize that it was a way for you to see
music<00:02:21.430> or<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> flip<00:02:22.959> side<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.500> hear<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
music or on the flip side to hear the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.520 
music or on the flip side to hear the
imagery

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.080 

playing<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> piano<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:32.130> kind<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.730> an

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
playing the piano is kind of like an

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.960 
playing the piano is kind of like an
extra<00:02:33.930> limb<00:02:34.170> having<00:02:35.040> another<00:02:35.250> arm<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.790> another

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
extra limb having another arm or another

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.830 
extra limb having another arm or another
leg<00:02:36.270> or<00:02:36.600> maybe<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.320> type<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.710> oxygen<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.840> remember

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
leg or maybe a type of oxygen I remember

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.660 
leg or maybe a type of oxygen I remember
being<00:02:40.110> very<00:02:40.200> connected<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> piano

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
being very connected to the piano

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.600 
being very connected to the piano
emotionally<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> child<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.830> remember

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
emotionally as a child I remember

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.910 
emotionally as a child I remember
especially<00:02:45.120> as<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.570> kid<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.140> would<00:02:46.260> go<00:02:46.410> away<00:02:46.500> for

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
especially as a kid we would go away for

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.680 
especially as a kid we would go away for
a<00:02:46.950> month<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.490> there<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:47.820> no<00:02:47.940> piano<00:02:48.270> where<00:02:48.600> we

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a month and there was no piano where we

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.830 
a month and there was no piano where we
went<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.380> made<00:02:49.560> me<00:02:49.590> feel<00:02:50.510> totally<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
went and it made me feel totally the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.260 
went and it made me feel totally the
equivalent<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.740> when<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.220> became<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.000> teenager

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
equivalent of when I became a teenager

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.480 
equivalent of when I became a teenager
and<00:02:54.660> realized<00:02:55.020> what<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.350> was<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:56.070> be<00:02:56.100> apart

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
and realized what it was to be apart

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:04.390 
and realized what it was to be apart
from<00:02:57.210> someone<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.510> loved<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.080> much<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.500> know

definitely<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> big<00:03:08.160> reality<00:03:08.580> for<00:03:09.420> me<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.840> kind
