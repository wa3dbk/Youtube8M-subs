00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
direction and explode into that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
direction and explode into that
direction<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.180> next<00:01:30.420> one's<00:01:30.570> gonna<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
direction the next one's gonna be the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.630 
direction the next one's gonna be the
tie<00:01:31.110> loss<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> cross<00:01:31.890> while<00:01:32.159> moving<00:01:32.400> right

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
tie loss and cross while moving right

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.999 
tie loss and cross while moving right
hesitation<00:01:33.540> inside-out<00:01:34.110> cross<00:01:34.470> left<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
hesitation inside-out cross left so it's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
hesitation inside-out cross left so it's
gonna<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.640> crossing<00:01:36.360> morph

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
gonna look just like that crossing morph

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
gonna look just like that crossing morph
right<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.930> left<00:01:37.079> while<00:01:37.320> moving<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.799> way

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right to left while moving that way

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
right to left while moving that way
hesitate<00:01:38.579> inside-out<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.810> cross<00:01:40.079> back

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
hesitate inside-out and then cross back

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
hesitate inside-out and then cross back
the<00:01:40.439> other<00:01:40.560> way<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.030> as

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the other way so as you can see here as

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
the other way so as you can see here as
I'm<00:01:42.270> crossing<00:01:42.630> over<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> right<00:01:43.110> side<00:01:43.350> I'm

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I'm crossing over to the right side I'm

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.830 
I'm crossing over to the right side I'm
gonna<00:01:43.619> move<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.829> feet<00:01:44.220> shuffling<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
gonna move my feet shuffling one two to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
gonna move my feet shuffling one two to
the<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:46.110> side<00:01:46.350> put<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> little<00:01:46.799> hesitation

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the right side put a little hesitation

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
the right side put a little hesitation
in<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.729> inside<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.079> fake<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in there inside out kind of fake a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
in there inside out kind of fake a
little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> left<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.399> back<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
little bit to the left and then back to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
little bit to the left and then back to
the<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.000> cross<00:01:51.420> hard<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.140> back

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the right cross hard from the right back

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
the right cross hard from the right back
to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> left<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.549> explode<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
to the left and really explode in that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
to the left and really explode in that
direction<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.079> these<00:01:55.320> changes<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
direction so all these changes of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
direction so all these changes of
direction<00:01:55.890> fake<00:01:56.610> changes<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> directions<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
direction fake changes of directions and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.030 
direction fake changes of directions and
hesitations<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.740> keep<00:01:58.920> your

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
hesitations are really gonna keep your

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.499 
hesitations are really gonna keep your
defenders<00:01:59.460> guessing<00:01:59.880> here's<00:02:00.240> what's<00:02:00.420> gonna

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
defenders guessing here's what's gonna

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
defenders guessing here's what's gonna
look<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.960> from<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.799> we're<00:02:01.950> he<00:02:02.100> did<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.369> in

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
look like from what we're he did it in

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.240 
look like from what we're he did it in
the<00:02:02.460> game<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.619> next<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:04.979> gonna<00:02:05.070> be

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the game and the next one is gonna be

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
the game and the next one is gonna be
the<00:02:05.280> Kyle<00:02:05.549> Lowry<00:02:06.000> Drive<00:02:06.299> left<00:02:06.540> behind<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the Kyle Lowry Drive left behind the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.619 
the Kyle Lowry Drive left behind the
back<00:02:07.320> stop<00:02:07.680> drive<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.270> key<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.539> this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
back stop drive right so the key to this

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180 
back stop drive right so the key to this
one<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> drive<00:02:10.289> really<00:02:10.649> hard<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
one is to drive really hard to the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
one is to drive really hard to the
basket<00:02:11.670> he<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.030> came<00:02:12.180> from<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.450> 45

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
basket he kind of came from a 45

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.259 
basket he kind of came from a 45
degree<00:02:13.230> angle<00:02:13.590> towards<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.010> hoop<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:14.489> then

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
degree angle towards the hoop and then

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.970 
degree angle towards the hoop and then
from<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.689> you're<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.049> gonna<00:02:16.170> basically

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
from there you're just gonna basically

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.039 
from there you're just gonna basically
dead<00:02:17.340> stop<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.969> you're<00:02:18.510> pushing<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
dead stop as you're pushing the

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.959 
dead stop as you're pushing the
basketball<00:02:19.230> behind<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.250> almost<00:02:20.549> straight

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
basketball behind you almost straight

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.420 
basketball behind you almost straight
back<00:02:21.239> away<00:02:21.719> from<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.140> hoop<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.620> that's<00:02:23.250> gonna

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
back away from the hoop and that's gonna

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.099 
back away from the hoop and that's gonna
really<00:02:23.730> catch<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.150> defender<00:02:24.659> off<00:02:24.810> guard

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
really catch the defender off guard

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.330 
really catch the defender off guard
they're<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.409> gonna<00:02:25.530> expect<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.159> come

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
they're not gonna expect you to come

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.039 
they're not gonna expect you to come
back<00:02:26.400> straight<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:27.060> way<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.750> gonna<00:02:27.870> free

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
back straight that way that's gonna free

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.119 
back straight that way that's gonna free
up<00:02:28.140> some<00:02:28.260> space<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.709> then<00:02:28.829> give<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
up some space and then give you the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.920 
up some space and then give you the
angle<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.670> come<00:02:30.090> back<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.420> toward<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.659> hoop<00:02:30.810> so

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
angle to come back in toward the hoop so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.209 
angle to come back in toward the hoop so
as<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.139> can<00:02:31.230> see<00:02:31.409> here<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.590> gives<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.859> a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
as you can see here that gives you a

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.459 
as you can see here that gives you a
slower<00:02:32.609> motion<00:02:33.180> idea<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.959> what<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.170> angle<00:02:34.439> is

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
slower motion idea of what the angle is

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.319 
slower motion idea of what the angle is
gonna<00:02:34.650> look<00:02:34.799> like<00:02:35.040> next<00:02:35.730> isn't<00:02:36.000> gonna<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
gonna look like next isn't gonna be the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.270 
gonna look like next isn't gonna be the

the ball and immediately go into that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.349 
the ball and immediately go into that
crossover<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.129> by<00:02:53.609> pushing<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.209> it's

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
crossover so by pushing it out it's

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.759 
crossover so by pushing it out it's
gonna<00:02:54.450> force<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.930> take<00:02:55.139> that<00:02:55.349> stuff<00:02:55.590> to

how we did it in the game from whoa at
the<00:03:03.030> same<00:03:03.209> spot<00:03:03.709> next<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.799> gonna<00:03:04.889> be<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
the same spot next is gonna be the

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.879 
the same spot next is gonna be the
Xavier<00:03:05.519> Henry<00:03:05.849> drive<00:03:06.750> left<00:03:07.079> reverse<00:03:07.560> between

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
this one is a little bit different

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.280 
this one is a little bit different
because<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:11.489> he<00:03:11.639> drove<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.269> left<00:03:12.540> when

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
because when he drove to the left when

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.619 
because when he drove to the left when
he<00:03:13.409> went<00:03:13.590> between<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.340> legs<00:03:14.639> from<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.269> back

as<00:03:16.129> you're<00:03:17.129> gonna<00:03:17.220> see<00:03:17.430> here<00:03:17.549> I'm<00:03:17.609> gonna<00:03:17.699> plant

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
as you're gonna see here I'm gonna plant

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.369 
as you're gonna see here I'm gonna plant
with<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.209> left<00:03:18.449> go<00:03:18.629> between<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.049> legs<00:03:19.229> with

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
with the left go between the legs with

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.170 
with the left go between the legs with
the<00:03:19.470> left<00:03:19.680> hand<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.010> right<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.849> dribble

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the left hand to the right that dribble

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.390 
the left hand to the right that dribble
here<00:03:21.599> ends<00:03:21.840> up<00:03:21.870> kind<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.199> high<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.709> crossover

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
here ends up kind of high that crossover

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.550 
here ends up kind of high that crossover
so<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.449> came<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.629> lot<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.959> time<00:03:25.169> to<00:03:25.290> kind<00:03:25.440> of

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
so that came a lot of time to kind of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.319 
so that came a lot of time to kind of
move<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.979> right<00:03:26.129> some<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.609> yet<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.970> then

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
move to the right some more yet and then

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.849 
move to the right some more yet and then
at<00:03:27.479> the<00:03:27.569> last<00:03:27.599> second<00:03:28.290> as<00:03:28.379> the<00:03:28.680> ball<00:03:28.829> was

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
at the last second as the ball was

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.439 
at the last second as the ball was
coming<00:03:29.099> down<00:03:29.370> he<00:03:29.519> crossed<00:03:29.790> back<00:03:29.970> over<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.329> the

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
coming down he crossed back over to the

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.539 
coming down he crossed back over to the
left<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:30.870> crossed<00:03:31.500> up<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.799> second<00:03:32.159> defender

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
left and crossed up the second defender

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
while kind of stepping out with that

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.559 
while kind of stepping out with that
left<00:04:44.300> foot<00:04:45.669> regular<00:04:46.669> crossover<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.330> really

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
left foot regular crossover and really

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:48.850

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
try to cover some ground on this one

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.290 
try to cover some ground on this one
like<00:04:48.979> you're<00:04:49.159> about<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.430> drive<00:04:49.789> in<00:04:49.969> fact<00:04:50.180> I

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
like you're about to drive in fact I

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.640 
like you're about to drive in fact I
think<00:04:50.360> he<00:04:50.629> was<00:04:50.750> about<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.199> drive<00:04:51.379> but<00:04:51.530> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
think he was about to drive but the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.709 
think he was about to drive but the
defender<00:04:52.009> cut<00:04:52.219> him<00:04:52.340> off<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:53.060> he<00:04:53.240> went<00:04:53.360> behind

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
defender cut him off so he went behind

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.839 
defender cut him off so he went behind
the<00:04:53.930> back<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:54.169> noticed<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.889> big<00:04:55.069> hop<00:04:55.430> by<00:04:55.639> take

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
the back and noticed the big hop by take

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.520 
the back and noticed the big hop by take
back<00:04:56.090> while<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.509> balls<00:04:56.719> in<00:04:56.900> one<00:04:57.080> hand<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:57.469> you

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
back while the balls in one hand so you

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.170 
back while the balls in one hand so you
can<00:04:57.590> get<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.860> step<00:04:58.250> back<00:04:58.490> in<00:04:58.669> yet<00:04:58.849> in<00:04:59.000> that

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
can get that step back in yet in that

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.059 
can get that step back in yet in that
one<00:04:59.479> dribble<00:04:59.840> allows<00:05:00.379> you<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.620> cover<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.919> lot<00:05:01.039> of

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
one dribble allows you to cover a lot of

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.559 
one dribble allows you to cover a lot of
ground<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.550> do<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.639> lot<00:05:01.789> of<00:05:01.819> changes<00:05:02.449> of

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
ground and do a lot of changes of

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.779 
ground and do a lot of changes of
direction<00:05:02.599> in<00:05:03.169> one<00:05:03.770> dribble<00:05:04.219> and<00:05:04.370> then<00:05:04.430> of

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
direction in one dribble and then of

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.129 
direction in one dribble and then of
course<00:05:04.819> you<00:05:05.180> want<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.389> make<00:05:05.539> sure<00:05:05.569> you<00:05:05.900> hit

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
course you want to make sure you hit

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.230 
course you want to make sure you hit
that<00:05:06.199> jump<00:05:06.650> shot<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.159> then<00:05:07.639> finally<00:05:08.060> we<00:05:08.150> got

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
that jump shot and then finally we got

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.749 
that jump shot and then finally we got
the<00:05:08.300> Andre<00:05:08.750> Iguodala<00:05:09.190> fast-break<00:05:10.190> dribbling

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
the Andre Iguodala fast-break dribbling

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.700 
the Andre Iguodala fast-break dribbling
left<00:05:11.090> behind<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.629> back<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.780> right<00:05:12.110> cross<00:05:12.469> left

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
left behind the back to right cross left

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.559 
left behind the back to right cross left
I<00:05:12.860> think<00:05:13.039> everyone's<00:05:13.460> seen<00:05:13.699> this<00:05:13.909> one<00:05:14.180> on<00:05:14.509> a

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
I think everyone's seen this one on a

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.180 
I think everyone's seen this one on a
fast-break<00:05:15.139> you're<00:05:15.349> gonna<00:05:15.440> get<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.650> full<00:05:15.919> speed

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
fast-break you're gonna get a full speed

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.430 
fast-break you're gonna get a full speed
dribble<00:05:16.639> going<00:05:16.969> push<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.930> ball<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.319> your

dribble going push the ball to your
right<00:05:18.620> side<00:05:18.830> now<00:05:19.069> what<00:05:19.250> he<00:05:19.400> did<00:05:19.610> with<00:05:19.729> this<00:05:19.849> is

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
right side now what he did with this is

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:21.820 
right side now what he did with this is
he<00:05:20.150> actually<00:05:20.330> pushed<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.900> out<00:05:20.960> fairly<00:05:21.500> far<00:05:21.710> to

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
he actually pushed it out fairly far to

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.290 
he actually pushed it out fairly far to
the<00:05:21.889> right<00:05:22.009> side<00:05:22.279> kind<00:05:22.550> of<00:05:22.639> far<00:05:22.879> outside<00:05:23.150> his

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
the right side kind of far outside his

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.999 
the right side kind of far outside his
body<00:05:23.449> which<00:05:23.719> is<00:05:23.840> kind<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.199> usually<00:05:24.439> a<00:05:24.500> no-no

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
body which is kind of usually a no-no

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.649 
body which is kind of usually a no-no
but<00:05:25.520> what<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.819> did<00:05:25.969> is<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.090> made<00:05:26.360> him<00:05:26.449> take<00:05:26.629> a

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
but what that did is it made him take a

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.510 
but what that did is it made him take a
big<00:05:26.960> step<00:05:27.229> out<00:05:27.439> to<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.650> right<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:28.129> get<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.370> that

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
big step out to the right to get to that

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.580 
big step out to the right to get to that
basketball<00:05:29.029> and<00:05:29.150> really<00:05:29.389> sell<00:05:29.960> that<00:05:30.139> fake<00:05:30.409> to

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
basketball and really sell that fake to

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.080 
basketball and really sell that fake to
the<00:05:30.710> right<00:05:30.889> and<00:05:31.069> then<00:05:31.520> when<00:05:31.639> he<00:05:31.699> crossed<00:05:31.909> over

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
the right and then when he crossed over

close to your defenders outside foot at

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.540 
close to your defenders outside foot at
that<00:06:17.509> point<00:06:17.870> they<00:06:18.080> have<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.710> respect<00:06:19.250> this

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
that point they have to respect this

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.430 
that point they have to respect this
fake<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.150> you're<00:06:20.479> moving<00:06:20.599> into<00:06:21.110> that

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
fake and you're moving into that

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.619 
fake and you're moving into that
direction<00:06:22.069> they<00:06:22.430> will<00:06:22.550> literally<00:06:23.000> have<00:06:23.360> to

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
direction they will literally have to

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.240 
direction they will literally have to
move<00:06:23.810> that<00:06:23.990> way<00:06:24.199> in<00:06:24.469> order<00:06:24.620> to<00:06:24.740> stay<00:06:25.009> in<00:06:25.039> front

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
move that way in order to stay in front

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.040 
move that way in order to stay in front
of<00:06:25.370> you<00:06:25.490> and<00:06:25.610> if<00:06:25.669> they<00:06:25.789> don't<00:06:26.120> then<00:06:26.779> you<00:06:26.900> can

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
of you and if they don't then you can

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.019 
of you and if they don't then you can
just<00:06:27.199> blow<00:06:27.379> right<00:06:27.409> past<00:06:27.620> them<00:06:28.159> so<00:06:28.339> by<00:06:28.729> getting

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
just blow right past them so by getting

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:30.579 
just blow right past them so by getting
that<00:06:29.150> close<00:06:29.419> to<00:06:29.659> them<00:06:29.750> while<00:06:29.990> moving<00:06:30.349> in<00:06:30.469> that

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:30.589 
that close to them while moving in that

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.140 
that close to them while moving in that
direction<00:06:30.650> before<00:06:31.310> changing<00:06:31.909> directions

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
direction before changing directions

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.240 
direction before changing directions
that's<00:06:32.899> gonna<00:06:33.080> force<00:06:33.469> them<00:06:33.680> to<00:06:33.830> move<00:06:34.039> the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
that's gonna force them to move the

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.680 
that's gonna force them to move the
other<00:06:34.399> way<00:06:34.610> really<00:06:34.849> quickly<00:06:35.389> and<00:06:35.599> they're

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
other way really quickly and they're

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.050 
other way really quickly and they're
going<00:06:35.779> to

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
going to

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.240 
going to
to<00:06:36.240> respect<00:06:36.720> that<00:06:36.930> first<00:06:37.230> fake<00:06:37.620> and<00:06:37.950> then

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
to respect that first fake and then

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.920 
to respect that first fake and then
finally<00:06:38.669> here's<00:06:38.850> one<00:06:39.060> final<00:06:39.300> example<00:06:39.570> of

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
finally here's one final example of

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.300 
finally here's one final example of
showing<00:06:40.200> you<00:06:40.290> with<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.410> Kyle<00:06:40.680> Lowry<00:06:41.070> one

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
showing you with the Kyle Lowry one

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.379 
showing you with the Kyle Lowry one
where<00:06:41.550> basically<00:06:41.820> you're<00:06:41.970> coming<00:06:42.300> straight

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
where basically you're coming straight

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.970 
where basically you're coming straight
at<00:06:42.570> the<00:06:42.780> defender<00:06:43.169> and<00:06:43.320> then<00:06:43.410> almost<00:06:43.560> jumping

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
at the defender and then almost jumping

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.470 
at the defender and then almost jumping
straight<00:06:44.250> back<00:06:44.610> in<00:06:44.820> the<00:06:44.850> direction<00:06:45.210> you<00:06:45.300> came

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
straight back in the direction you came

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.840 
straight back in the direction you came
from<00:06:45.720> again<00:06:46.320> by<00:06:46.560> getting<00:06:46.919> that<00:06:47.040> deep<00:06:47.370> in<00:06:47.639> on

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
from again by getting that deep in on

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.850 
from again by getting that deep in on
your<00:06:48.000> defender<00:06:48.540> and<00:06:48.750> that<00:06:49.080> close<00:06:49.410> to<00:06:49.620> him<00:06:49.740> in

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
your defender and that close to him in

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.590 
your defender and that close to him in
fact<00:06:50.010> you<00:06:50.190> actually<00:06:50.550> slightly<00:06:50.850> pass<00:06:51.270> them<00:06:51.570> to

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
fact you actually slightly pass them to

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.260 
fact you actually slightly pass them to
a<00:06:51.750> degree<00:06:51.990> they're<00:06:52.770> gonna<00:06:52.919> really<00:06:53.310> bite<00:06:54.000> hard

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
a degree they're gonna really bite hard

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.730 
a degree they're gonna really bite hard
to<00:06:54.389> try<00:06:54.540> to<00:06:54.600> get<00:06:54.780> back<00:06:54.900> in<00:06:55.080> front<00:06:55.320> of<00:06:55.410> you<00:06:55.530> and

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
to try to get back in front of you and
