units on there's going to be two of them

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.800 
units on there's going to be two of them
is<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> back<00:01:46.399> and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
is going to go back here in the back and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.730 
is going to go back here in the back and
then<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:48.960> we're<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> we're

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
then what we're going to do is we're

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.210 
then what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> pull<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.390> plug<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.220> I'll

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
going to pull this plug out of here I'll

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.160 
going to pull this plug out of here I'll
have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.670> popper<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.079> then

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
have to get a popper to do that and then

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.600 
have to get a popper to do that and then
we're<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> put<00:01:55.649> another<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.130> here

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
we're going to put another one in here

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
we're going to put another one in here
as<00:01:57.240> well<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.990> that'll<00:01:58.740> take<00:01:58.920> care<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.460> of

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
going to grab that rivet nut and I'm

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.569 
going to grab that rivet nut and I'm
going<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.680> show<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:20.829> guys<00:02:20.980> how<00:02:21.159> to<00:02:21.189> install

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
going to show you guys how to install

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.250 
going to show you guys how to install
that<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.510> where<00:02:22.659> we're<00:02:22.840> going<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.049> put

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
that this is where we're going to put

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
that this is where we're going to put
our<00:02:23.409> rivet<00:02:23.920> nut<00:02:24.159> but<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.640> can<00:02:24.790> see<00:02:24.970> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
our rivet nut but as you can see it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
our rivet nut but as you can see it
doesn't<00:02:25.299> quite<00:02:25.569> fit<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.530> factory<00:02:26.980> holder

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
doesn't quite fit in the factory holder

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.890 
doesn't quite fit in the factory holder
so<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.150> we're<00:02:28.269> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.450> need<00:02:28.599> to<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:28.870> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
so what we're going to need to do is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.259 
so what we're going to need to do is
take<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> half<00:02:29.620> inch<00:02:29.890> drill<00:02:30.190> bit<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.459> just

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
take a half inch drill bit and just

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.800 
take a half inch drill bit and just
drill<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:31.720> out<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:32.920> way<00:02:33.310> our<00:02:33.579> rivet<00:02:34.540> nut

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
drill that out so that way our rivet nut

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.690 
drill that out so that way our rivet nut
will<00:02:34.989> fit<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.349> there<00:02:35.590> that'll<00:02:36.159> work<00:02:36.310> we're

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
will fit in there that'll work we're

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.130 
will fit in there that'll work we're
going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.879> take<00:02:37.000> our<00:02:37.180> hammer<00:02:37.390> we're<00:02:37.659> tap<00:02:37.930> that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
going to take our hammer we're tap that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.009 
going to take our hammer we're tap that
in<00:02:38.319> there<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:39.280> should<00:02:39.459> be<00:02:39.579> good<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> go<00:02:40.090> got

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
in there and we should be good to go got

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.940 
in there and we should be good to go got
our<00:02:41.230> rivet<00:02:42.189> nut<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.640> there<00:02:43.090> into<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> hole<00:02:44.079> we

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
our rivet nut in there into the hole we

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.849 
our rivet nut in there into the hole we
have<00:02:44.980> our<00:02:45.340> tool<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:46.060> puts<00:02:46.359> it<00:02:46.569> in<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:47.440> there

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
have our tool that puts it in on there

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.349 
have our tool that puts it in on there
so<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.250> next<00:02:48.430> thing<00:02:48.640> we're<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:48.879> to<00:02:48.940> do<00:02:49.120> then

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
so the next thing we're going to do then

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.000 
so the next thing we're going to do then
is<00:02:49.870> we're<00:02:50.049> going<00:02:50.139> to<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.379> ahead<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.739> attach

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
is we're going to go ahead and attach

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.920 
is we're going to go ahead and attach
that<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.269> do<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.750> put<00:02:52.870> a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that and the way we do that is to put a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.229 
that and the way we do that is to put a
wrench<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.379> that<00:02:53.440> nut<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.129> then<00:02:54.700> another<00:02:54.940> one

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
wrench on that nut and then another one

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.080 
wrench on that nut and then another one
on<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.810> bolt<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.799> have<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> hold<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.489> nut

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
on the bolt and you have to hold the nut

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.349 
on the bolt and you have to hold the nut
and<00:02:58.420> crank<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.409> bolt<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.459> essentially

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
and crank the bolt and it's essentially

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.789 
and crank the bolt and it's essentially
what<00:03:01.480> we're<00:03:01.629> doing<00:03:01.659> is<00:03:02.019> we're<00:03:02.230> actually

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
what we're doing is we're actually

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.599 
what we're doing is we're actually
crushing<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:04.420> rivet<00:03:04.989> up<00:03:05.980> against<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
crushing that rivet up against the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.890 
crushing that rivet up against the
backside<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.569> your<00:03:08.609> rocker<00:03:09.609> panel<00:03:10.150> we've<00:03:10.750> got

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
backside of your rocker panel we've got

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.330 
backside of your rocker panel we've got
it<00:03:10.989> tightened<00:03:11.260> down<00:03:11.409> it<00:03:11.530> should<00:03:11.859> be<00:03:12.010> good<00:03:12.190> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it tightened down it should be good and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.369 
it tightened down it should be good and
crushed<00:03:12.639> in<00:03:12.909> there<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.959> we're<00:03:14.079> going<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.290> do

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
crushed in there so we're going to do

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.129 
crushed in there so we're going to do
those<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:14.739> going<00:03:14.889> to<00:03:14.950> loosen<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:16.049> pull<00:03:17.049> it

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
those we're going to loosen this pull it

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:27.990 
those we're going to loosen this pull it
up<00:03:17.260> here<00:03:18.269> remove<00:03:19.620> our<00:03:20.620> installation<00:03:21.400> tool<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
up here remove our installation tool and
