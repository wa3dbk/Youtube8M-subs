00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
Assassin's Creed 2 which I considered to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
Assassin's Creed 2 which I considered to
be<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> pinnacle<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> series<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.330> the

gameplay is uncomfortable too Assassin's
Creed<00:01:30.420> 3<00:01:30.450> where<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.900> crafting<00:01:31.439> mechanic<00:01:31.860> was

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
Creed 3 where the crafting mechanic was

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
Creed 3 where the crafting mechanic was
just<00:01:32.250> overly<00:01:33.000> complex<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> way

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
just overly complex and out of the way

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.980 
just overly complex and out of the way
and<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> game<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.610> entirely<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.509> long

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and the game was just entirely a long

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
and the game was just entirely a long
tutorial<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.979> kept<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.400> handcuffs

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
tutorial and it kept you on handcuffs

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
tutorial and it kept you on handcuffs
but<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.479> game<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> action

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
but in this game you get into the action

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.149 
but in this game you get into the action
fairly<00:01:41.549> quickly<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.270> you're<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.439> let<00:01:43.920> loose
