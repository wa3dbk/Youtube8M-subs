00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.930
 julie we're in the maternity here at 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.210
 From what time do you start 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.340
 make the limit to rochefort with the 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.590
 pigs but this secret for that and stays 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.019
 with their march to about 21 25 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.310
 days after her decides to wean them off 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.539
 of the sow that their mother 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.369
 how's it going to happen how olizane 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.119
 but we win in this way with the 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.140
 farm employees 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.789
 what are we going to do we are going to go 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 what is called weaning 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.489
 we're going to bring out the thinkers and the brave 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.949
 but this leap will put them in the aisle 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.679
 then by means of panels we go 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.360
 bring to then Landing 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.829
 soap without suitcases in the truck 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.000
 by the bullets I know 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.149
 the independent is what there are 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.920
 established links between improving 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.229
 well-being of the animal during the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.839
 transport and the quality of the meat on 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.879
 knows that a relationship well being animal and 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.250
 quality also becomes manipulation 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.560
 is made with cider is under the animal 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.659
 is done during transport and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 yet that's all we're going to have a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.530
 impact on meat quality at all 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 days it's amazing the amount of 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.819
 manipulation that people in fire on the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.690
 firm and then they were taught to be 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.690
 sweet with the years 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.110
 julie barrette and fans why 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.049
 but in fact when they go to the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.430
 truck if we put the fan that is 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.259
 what does it do to your serena who 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.000
 come from outside the truck that 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.350
 piglets my body as having a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.330
 course and keeping the face you see 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.070
 not tan in the name I do not my year by 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.590
 So what are we doing is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.590
 closing a certain pressure fan 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.210
 north between outside and inside 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.240
 they will go to the truck that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.500
 will not feel exactly towards 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.180
 to the huge effect until it has 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.649
 not be an insult this policy or 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.030
 know is that it has great that the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.030
 reverse the truck by mail 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.820
 because the parcels and embarks on his 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.070
 slats life can cling they 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.600
 will start hanging if they do at spa dea 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.450
 and bad germain to the pope 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.840
 so they go it's no longer the network 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.570
 yesterday in his truck eyes these are the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.770
 good days and dish to the trucks you 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.950
 you are at the home is what the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.600
 particular gezin truck for 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 advance 10 personal each our 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.320
 trucks are designed to be 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.390
 specifically adapted to the needs of 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.980
 piglets as in this case also there are 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 of the wood bank in the bottom for 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.900
 not just that they are hurting themselves 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 Pope 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.640
 fasten your seatbelts after the break 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.599
 the only ports has become travel group 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.599
 In first class 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.880
 market 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.830
 julie we saw the little piglets to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.780
 motherhood then they will spend these 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.280
 weeks six to eight weeks at the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.390
 first then they come to the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.360
 fattening farm 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.489
 we're in front of a fattening farm 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.409
 they will stay here how long they will 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.799
 will stay here about a hundred of 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.900
 days 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.930
 then of that so take him away 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.099
 pig in the truck pen what is it 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.659
 that you take complications 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.459
 sequentially there was a lot 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.299
 of use of electric baton at 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.670
 level of transport 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.370
 we completely removed everything 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.620
 electric boats 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.760
 the palette not in fact that db2 lady 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.129
 what does it do it like 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.810
 stimulate the pig to go by in 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.019
 before it is done like a little bit 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.440
 scared but is she really not bad shot 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.989
 next to electric boats for good 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.200
 handle the pig must do better 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.140
 understand his behavior which fos puts 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.670
 from side to back both sides for 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.840
 that they understand that there is someone 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.909
 which gradually brings him to the truck 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 we hang desrochers we take signs 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.379
 the ace masnieres gold with his legion if he 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.849
 see a panel ben he will not look 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.200
 to leave by an aria for him it's 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.720
 as if they had silva barriers 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.820
 no place to go if you 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.380
 understand well for the animal ben 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.110
 precisely you will not need to use 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.789
 tools that will hurt him or is 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.830
 so to editions what is it 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.570
 did we also visited all 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.970
 breeders for us to change their 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.190
 buildings according to the well-being of 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.830
 the animal so that just everything is 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.250
 easier for andrÃ© towards the truck 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.840
 so we often changed the width of 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.030
 passage for some pigs 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.500
 that they can pass at the same time 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.500
 meaning cause and bruising 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.990
 level such as its truck 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.970
 peculiarities inside the truck 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.220
 of all the barriers where we put a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.350
 defined number of pigs for that when 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.780
 he goes off to the road also a 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.850
 braking peace why pigs 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.850
 pile up and get hurt 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.800
 we also put during the summer 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.590
 foggers for sprinkles a little 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.440
 little by broth shower for that pig 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.930
 feel better if he ever gets warm 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.270
 we have shutters so that precisely the t 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.900
 we have the roads in winter we do not close them 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.930
 that a fright 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.650
 you yourself are the veterinarian of 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.780
 now 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.750
 so I imagine that the well-being of 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.520
 animals it's part of our life 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.710
 of children my role is late so 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.590
 that the enemy is well of his birth 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.210
 until israel at the slaughterhouse hall 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.500
 had positive impacts but we do it 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.270
 really because we love animals 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.680
 and then we want them to be healthy 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.050
 are my mandate plus animals be in 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.520
 health all the time of their life julie 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.060
 menard thank you very much 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.060
 the ticket
