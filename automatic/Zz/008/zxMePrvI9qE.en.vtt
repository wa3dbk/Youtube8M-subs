00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
getting to is there from done by was a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
getting to is there from done by was a
bit<00:01:26.939> slow<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.509> sorry<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
bit slow I'm sorry about that but that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.789 
bit slow I'm sorry about that but that
was<00:01:28.909> Scotland<00:01:29.909> drawn<00:01:30.150> against<00:01:30.869> Argentina's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
was Scotland drawn against Argentina's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.810 
was Scotland drawn against Argentina's
and<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:35.250> does<00:01:35.689> strike<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.829> that<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.250> would<00:01:38.640> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and it does strike me that that would be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
and it does strike me that that would be
the<00:01:38.850> opening<00:01:39.090> game<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> entire

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the opening game of the entire

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.310 
the opening game of the entire
tournament

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.900 

I<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:46.720> really<00:01:47.720> do<00:01:47.870> think<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.380> being<00:01:51.910> confusion

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
I I really do think that being confusion

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.110 
I I really do think that being confusion
down<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.420> because<00:01:54.550> they're<00:01:55.550> going<00:01:55.580> back

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
down there because they're going back

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.880 
down there because they're going back
they're<00:01:56.660> going<00:01:56.870> back<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.440> ball<00:01:57.620> they're

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
they're going back to the ball they're

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.440 
they're going back to the ball they're
not<00:01:58.010> too<00:01:58.160> happy<00:01:58.310> about<00:01:58.490> that<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.850> there<00:02:02.270> is

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
not too happy about that and there is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.540 
not too happy about that and there is
confusion<00:02:02.990> about<00:02:03.290> what<00:02:03.650> is<00:02:03.830> going<00:02:04.040> on<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
confusion about what is going on the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.130 
confusion about what is going on the
information<00:02:04.820> given<00:02:05.240> there's<00:02:05.600> at<00:02:05.750> least<00:02:05.780> it
