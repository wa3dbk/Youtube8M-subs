00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello comrades today i will show you 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.380
 CPU acceleration 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.570
 amd64 long processor 4600 plus on 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 motherboard is silit coffin black 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.650
 series 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.470
 Now the speed of our processor 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:28.710
 equal to 2 4 gigahertz measured by 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 cpu-z or spc programs 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.640
 click ok to close now we 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.640
 reboot our system 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:12.500
 Use the dalit key to enter the menu 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:18.760
 bios go to the tab m y bin here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.760
 we will find the overclocking function circus and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.970
 activated also appeared us 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.270
 overclocking freq where value defaulted 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:37.210
 equal to 200 this value needs to be increased 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:42.190
 don't bother to go over the top 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.190
 I will set the value 249 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.380
 244 will put a lot 243 all exit 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380
 save 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:46.310
 we go cd to check the change 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:50.510
 processor speed and we see 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:57.290
 now our speed is 2 and 9 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.819
 gigahertz close on it think everything 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.819
 Thank you for watching
