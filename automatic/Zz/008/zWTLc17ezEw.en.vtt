ounce of marijuana on the corner this

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.020 
ounce of marijuana on the corner this
brings<00:03:36.130> up<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.280> whole<00:03:36.550> concept<00:03:36.910> of

structural<00:03:37.630> violence<00:03:37.930> because<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.440> just

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
structural violence because you just

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.960 
structural violence because you just

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
point that you know if I went down to a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.920 
point that you know if I went down to a
river<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.459> dumped<00:03:42.850> 20<00:03:43.390> barrels<00:03:43.630> of

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
toxic sludge or some sort of you know

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.030 
toxic sludge or some sort of you know
chemical<00:03:46.630> in<00:03:46.810> there<00:03:46.930> I'd<00:03:47.049> be<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.350> jail<00:03:47.650> I'd<00:03:47.860> be

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
chemical in there I'd be in jail I'd be

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.030 
chemical in there I'd be in jail I'd be
faced<00:03:48.280> with<00:03:48.310> millions<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:48.820> dollars<00:03:48.880> in<00:03:49.180> fines

why<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.489> people<00:03:51.549> can't<00:03:52.120> compute<00:03:52.600> that

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
why is it that people can't compute that

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.570 
why is it that people can't compute that
you<00:03:52.989> know<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.260> large<00:03:53.530> scale<00:03:53.860> this<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.280> this

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
you know on a large scale this is this

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.060 
you know on a large scale this is this
is<00:03:54.730> criminal<00:03:55.120> this<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.269> murderous<00:03:56.019> well<00:03:56.920> they

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
is criminal this is murderous well they

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.190 
is criminal this is murderous well they
can<00:03:57.400> they<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.940> compute<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.510> can<00:03:58.720> we<00:03:58.900> can<00:03:59.080> do

can they can compute I can we can do

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.560 
can they can compute I can we can do
this<00:03:59.350> down<00:03:59.620> yes<00:04:00.130> we<00:04:00.459> can<00:04:00.670> compute<00:04:01.060> this<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.420> can

this down yes we can compute this we can

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.420 
this down yes we can compute this we can
