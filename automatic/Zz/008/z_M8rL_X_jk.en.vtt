00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.029
 new video I am Ã¡lvarez del vayo and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 this is a video completely of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.650
 opinion let's talk about what I believe 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.519
 you have to do the high-end 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.969
 Android against the iphone directly to 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.969
 coat 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 attentively 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.150
 in the last podcast world and out the 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.070
 force mobiles in number 6 Ivan Samuel and 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.320
 I was debating on how I would have to 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.690
 behave the high-end android for 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.760
 try to slow down the iphone and that is that apple 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.890
 is taking today as you want 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.720
 is being called the most 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.739
 of the benefits of the high-end of the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.330
 mobile phone plan 90 percent 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.309
 it's really taking 90 percent 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.949
 of the total of the mobile telephony a 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.480
 outrageous from my partner 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.010
 samuel that a possible strategy of 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.980
 Big manufacturers like samsung would be 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.530
 create a terminal of that size of those 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.090
 benefits of that quality with a 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.399
 price similar to iphone but then 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.020
 will not go down is to say something that when 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.220
 someone will buy me say good 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.770
 I'm going to buy but it's the best during 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 a year will not go down well from my point 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 of sight 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.829
 I think it's just the opposite apple is 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.509
 creating a terminal for a series of 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.979
 users who do not value the price is 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.270
 say he does not care what it costs they go to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 buy an iphone then so 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.899
 having that status and others as 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.299
 that I will organize analyzing more 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.729
 more mobile terminals some very expensive 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.380
 like the samsung galaxy s 6 and the notebook 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.569
 4 the axis 4 the htc one 9 etcetera and others 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.990
 Very cheap as the motor or the motorcycle in 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.850
 moto gp terminals even as some 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.000
 latest models of alcatel de meizu 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 etcetera and it has made me think that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 really where is the balance is in 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.220
 a terminal of about 300 and few euros 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.069
 nothing of 390 315 of 330 with a body of 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.039
 aluminum with premium finishes with 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.899
 a power more than enough but that 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.390
 can fight against the iphone in a 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.190
 aspect that is the price why 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.599
 I say this because if you are going to try 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.549
 fight against the iphone with one hundred euros 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.440
 of difference even if they have better 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.579
 benefits even if your mobile is better 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.740
 even if your operating system is more 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.920
 open to the end user is a 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.390
 attention but if I was offering a 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.620
 good quality 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.120
 a good terminal a good 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.450
 benefits some good finishes a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.000
 good all at half price literally 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.610
 of what the iphone costs then 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.950
 there will be many users, many others will not 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.980
 that they will think about it because they do not 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.200
 want or can not aspire to have a 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.800
 spending 700 euros a year on a 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.950
 smartphone 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.580
 that's why terminals like jaume and 4 me 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.250
 they seem really very balanced and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.130
 done already or me is one of the brands that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.200
 more is growing using this policy 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.290
 of price containment throughout the range 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.850
 not only the high-end and at the same time 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.360
 establishing a community creating 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.460
 brand image something that they also have 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.860
 that make it maker obviously if 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.200
 we do all this this is done by all 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.560
 the manufacturers in heretics plan craving or 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.690
 I did the bucket all at the end no no 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.850
 there is cadaval given two but 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.700
 we have always said that asus could be 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.190
 the role of the android that htc could 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.920
 be the apple android really from my 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.680
 point of view since omni can be that 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.040
 variant with the operating system of 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.290
 Google 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.850
 now that I see how it interests me that I 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.620
 give your opinion if you think that the 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.500
 Price factor is as important as I 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.790
 I think or not really and how can you 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.820
 fight against the giant of cupertino 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.070
 from android fight from the point of 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.690
 positive view i always said 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.550
 I still have an iphone is not my mobile 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.820
 I still believe that it is a very 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.870
 good mobile but it does not compensate clear from 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.090
 my point of view 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.560
 I want to know yours as always 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.230
