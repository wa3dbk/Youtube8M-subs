00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370 
control over the match and I just did
everything<00:02:24.550> right<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> first<00:02:26.170> set

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
everything right in the first set

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.600 
everything right in the first set
especially<00:02:27.480> tactically<00:02:28.480> wise<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:29.170> was<00:02:29.830> quick<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
especially tactically wise I was quick I

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.880 
especially tactically wise I was quick I
was<00:02:30.910> moving<00:02:31.690> well<00:02:32.020> covering<00:02:32.470> most<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
was moving well covering most of the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.040 
was moving well covering most of the
court<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.580> getting<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.180> lot<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.360> returns<00:02:34.780> in

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
court and getting a lot of returns in

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.830 
court and getting a lot of returns in
which<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.590> think<00:02:35.860> important<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.840> he

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
which was I think important because he

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.290 
which was I think important because he
has<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> quite<00:02:38.290> good<00:02:38.470> serve<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.250> which<00:02:40.000> wasn't

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
has a quite good serve so which wasn't

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.930 
has a quite good serve so which wasn't
serving<00:02:40.780> him<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.110> well<00:02:41.320> tonight<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.250> felt

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
serving him that well tonight and I felt

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.430 
serving him that well tonight and I felt
pressure<00:02:43.209> because<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.630> was<00:02:43.840> returning<00:02:44.170> really

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
pressure because I was returning really

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.780 
pressure because I was returning really
