which<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:31.840> pretty<00:00:32.169> good<00:00:32.289> for<00:00:32.349> this<00:00:32.590> segment

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
which is pretty good for this segment

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.580 
which is pretty good for this segment
for<00:00:33.160> sure<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.579> among<00:00:34.510> its<00:00:34.539> other<00:00:34.809> options<00:00:35.260> its

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
for sure and among its other options its

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.250 
for sure and among its other options its
smattering<00:00:36.340> of<00:00:36.460> four-cylinder<00:00:37.120> engines<00:00:37.540> but

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
smattering of four-cylinder engines but

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.319 
smattering of four-cylinder engines but
it's<00:00:38.620> really<00:00:39.070> trying<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.520> get<00:00:39.670> buyers<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:40.180> hop

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
it's really trying to get buyers to hop

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.420 
it's really trying to get buyers to hop
on<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.660> Harvard<00:00:40.960> wagon<00:00:41.350> so<00:00:41.920> they<00:00:42.070> they're

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
on the Harvard wagon so they they're

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.370 
on the Harvard wagon so they they're
accompanying<00:00:42.880> that<00:00:42.940> with<00:00:43.329> some<00:00:43.840> design

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
accompanying that with some design

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.190 
accompanying that with some design
features<00:00:44.860> for<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.160> hybrid<00:00:45.340> specifically<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
features for the hybrid specifically so

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.960 
features for the hybrid specifically so
because<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:47.590> mid-sized<00:00:47.980> sedan<00:00:48.010> market<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.820> so

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
because the mid-sized sedan market is so

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.090 
because the mid-sized sedan market is so
massive<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.750> Chevy<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.440> really<00:00:50.710> trying<00:00:50.980> to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
massive and Chevy is really trying to

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.090 
massive and Chevy is really trying to
grab<00:00:51.550> as<00:00:51.850> many<00:00:52.270> of<00:00:52.510> its<00:00:52.690> competitors<00:00:53.350> shoppers

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
grab as many of its competitors shoppers

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.830 
grab as many of its competitors shoppers
as<00:00:54.309> possible<00:00:54.820> they've<00:00:55.450> had<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.809> make

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
as possible they've had to make

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.990 
as possible they've had to make
improvements<00:00:56.800> on<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.010> inside<00:00:57.430> not<00:00:57.670> just<00:00:57.700> the

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
improvements on the inside not just the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.240 
improvements on the inside not just the
outside<00:00:58.090> so<00:00:58.870> for<00:00:59.380> example<00:00:59.710> because<00:01:00.010> it's<00:01:00.190> a

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
outside so for example because it's a

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.490 
outside so for example because it's a
little<00:01:00.399> longer<00:01:00.880> now<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.450> rear<00:01:01.930> passengers

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
little longer now the rear passengers

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.350 
little longer now the rear passengers
have<00:01:02.710> more<00:01:02.920> legroom<00:01:03.219> which<00:01:03.850> was<00:01:04.059> always<00:01:04.239> a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
have more legroom which was always a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.969 
have more legroom which was always a
concern<00:01:04.509> with<00:01:04.930> previous<00:01:05.320> generation<00:01:05.829> now

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
concern with previous generation now

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.590 
concern with previous generation now
là-bas<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.729> tech<00:01:06.969> has<00:01:07.149> also<00:01:07.329> been

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
là-bas the tech has also been

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.749 
là-bas the tech has also been
significantly<00:01:08.200> improved<00:01:08.709> and<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.399> quality

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
significantly improved and the quality

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.520 
significantly improved and the quality
of<00:01:09.789> the<00:01:09.939> materials<00:01:10.420> on<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.630> inside<00:01:11.020> has<00:01:11.469> been

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
of the materials on the inside has been

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.830 
of the materials on the inside has been
upgraded<00:01:11.859> as<00:01:12.280> well<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:13.060> with<00:01:13.299> its<00:01:13.479> exterior

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
than some of its competitors so Chevy

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.709 
than some of its competitors so Chevy
took<00:01:48.310> some<00:01:48.520> bold<00:01:48.759> moves<00:01:48.849> when<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.389> comes<00:01:49.539> to

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
took some bold moves when it comes to

took some bold moves when it comes to
its<00:01:49.869> design<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.560> we'll<00:01:50.889> see<00:01:51.009> if<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.279> pays

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
its design and we'll see if that pays
