00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
vibration you can actually set custom

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.980 
vibration you can actually set custom
vibrations<00:06:27.000> just<00:06:27.210> tap<00:06:27.419> like<00:06:27.630> a<00:06:27.659> certain

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
vibrations just tap like a certain

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.779 
vibrations just tap like a certain
number<00:06:28.139> of<00:06:28.289> times<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:29.009> it<00:06:29.220> will<00:06:29.340> set<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.550> custom

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
number of times and it will set a custom

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:32.279 
vibration and you can also assign those

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.190 
vibration and you can also assign those
custom<00:06:32.669> vibrations<00:06:33.090> to<00:06:33.300> specific<00:06:33.719> contacts

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
custom vibrations to specific contacts

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.080 
custom vibrations to specific contacts
which<00:06:34.740> is<00:06:34.889> really<00:06:35.130> helpful<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:35.639> I<00:06:35.729> like<00:06:35.940> how

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
which is really helpful and I like how

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.410 
which is really helpful and I like how
they<00:06:36.210> have

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
they have

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.060 
they have
added<00:06:36.630> this<00:06:36.750> it<00:06:36.960> makes<00:06:37.080> it<00:06:37.260> easier<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:37.770> know

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
added this it makes it easier to know

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.220 
added this it makes it easier to know
who's<00:06:38.400> actually<00:06:38.640> calling<00:06:39.000> you<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:39.480> what<00:06:40.050> not

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
who's actually calling you and what not

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.890 
who's actually calling you and what not
so<00:06:41.010> basically<00:06:41.520> that<00:06:41.850> is<00:06:41.880> the<00:06:42.210> hidden<00:06:42.420> features

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
so basically that is the hidden features

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.200 
so basically that is the hidden features
that<00:06:43.050> they<00:06:43.140> have<00:06:43.260> added<00:06:43.410> in<00:06:43.710> iOS<00:06:44.130> 5<00:06:44.460> a<00:06:44.820> lot<00:06:45.120> of

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
that they have added in iOS 5 a lot of

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.910
