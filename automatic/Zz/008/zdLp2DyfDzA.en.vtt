00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.640
 what is my name is july shock 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.640
 etc and if it already came out grand theft auto 5 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.320
 for playstation 4 next game the truth 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.730
 I 'm in first person and I'm super 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.070
 wrong for this time sheet that guides and in 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.019
 first person and I'm horrible and they did 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.910
 more time seen me doing careers 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.460
 although I live pretty horrible 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.869
 so changing this if we go back like this 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.250
 time playstation 4 is like with the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.510
 touch to give him to kiss it 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.810
 changed in first person different 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.060
 cameras and that and I'm going to go here to where 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.580
 are the weapons and that's what the cha 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.190
 You are going to see there, killing people with 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.219
 the and that's pretty cool follow you 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.690
 uploading gameplay of new things and 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.390
 but I do not have many kids because 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.180
 I did it was transfer my character 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.840
 and I think you do not get the 500 thousand 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.370
 weights to the character that are face you not 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.590
 They understood that they are like the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.840
 what you did is new so I do not have 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.050
 guys that's bad I think maybe I 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.030
 I make a new character to have chau 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.739
 and spend and buy new things 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.140
 I only have when I have about 40 thousand 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.489
 pesos and you can buy them here and then 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 they are knowing a state so if it is here 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.920
 in the end the ax and as I said you do not speak 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.530
 and like killing people but it's the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.500
 first day, I can not even 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 join as is person play not the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.160
 struggle and it's quite early that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.899
 12 hours 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.020
 This video seen with the dimension afternoon 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.550
 I do not know if in the afternoon and work but 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.960
 makes you less sense because by the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.960
 late is that saint where tiny 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.720
 the school and they are much more full 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.100
 the servers and that's so if you have not 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.380
 could he play if he does not see me with other people 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.360
 I was here like I'm just playing 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.460
 see probably had when this 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.320
 let it go out it's like it's the game 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 come out as the evil you and I can do 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.860
 like things are again and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.390
 that is possible to know that they want to see you from 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.900
 his accident some tutor 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.159
 that they do not know how to do something to get something 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 probably ballast the consumption a 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.119
 tutorial and how to get it and pal 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.479
 things like that are hidden in the game and 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.979
 that and if it 's basically impression of 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.170
 game is not like I 'm watching the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.840
 player as well as how many people that is 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 as I want basic so much auto 5 so 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.740
 online play with other people have fun 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.560
 with that when only how fun 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.060
 put the same understand as jets I 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.440
 I was waiting like this with the first day I played with 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 other people but if you knew that the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.790
 whistles was going to be half fucked but 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.530
 I do not expect so early you were 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.270
 so the possible Jews know if 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.220
 you already got it that way in 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.470
 extends playstation box ejection is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.330
 they get playstation 4 then I 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.980
 add for probably is 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.440
 inviting if to make career when 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.970
 they have good careers and I do not know if the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.140
 playstation3 races by the move 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.910
 as well as the one for playstation 4 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.940
 they maintain as well as new careers 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 let's see how this works but yes 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.390
 I liked it so fair the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.190
 character was quite simple was the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.950
 leader literally not on the account 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.900
 you are the club and everything was transferred 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.580
 but if nothing is basically everything 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.470
 I wanted to talk today if you liked the 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.840
