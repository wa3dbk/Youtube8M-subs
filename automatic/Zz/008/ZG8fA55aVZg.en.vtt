there's a snap in here and there's
multiple<00:02:28.800> positions<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.180> you're

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
multiple positions for it so you're

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.640 
multiple positions for it so you're
gonna<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:30.540> able<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.690> position<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.319> at<00:02:31.500> the
