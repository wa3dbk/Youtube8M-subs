00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
water stone on them so let's start out

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.850 
water stone on them so let's start out
with<00:00:41.210> shelter<00:00:41.690> let's<00:00:42.110> all<00:00:42.200> catch<00:00:42.440> these<00:00:42.620> guys

with shelter let's all catch these guys

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.520 
with shelter let's all catch these guys
and<00:00:43.250> then<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:44.030> could<00:00:44.150> start<00:00:44.390> out<00:00:45.200> they're

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
and then we could start out they're

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.710 
and then we could start out they're
killing<00:00:45.830> each<00:00:45.860> other<00:00:45.950> of<00:00:46.250> course<00:00:46.790> so<00:00:47.330> we'll

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
killing each other of course so we'll

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.270 
killing each other of course so we'll
start<00:00:47.960> with<00:00:48.020> these<00:00:48.170> two<00:00:48.410> get<00:00:48.860> into<00:00:49.010> your<00:00:49.100> poly

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
start with these two get into your poly

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.060 
start with these two get into your poly
world<00:00:49.520> killed<00:00:50.030> Evie<00:00:50.380> cruel<00:00:51.380> little<00:00:51.530> fart<00:00:51.860> and

world killed Evie cruel little fart and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.430 
world killed Evie cruel little fart and
then<00:00:52.730> we'll<00:00:52.910> just<00:00:53.030> spawn<00:00:53.300> another<00:00:53.510> Evie<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.350> we

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
then we'll just spawn another Evie so we

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.570 
then we'll just spawn another Evie so we
could<00:00:54.560> do<00:00:54.650> that<00:00:54.680> um<00:00:56.980> so<00:00:57.980> we're<00:00:58.190> gonna<00:00:58.280> do<00:00:58.430> guys

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
could do that um so we're gonna do guys

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.560 
could do that um so we're gonna do guys
is<00:00:59.380> I'm<00:01:00.380> gonna<00:01:00.590> go<00:01:00.710> over<00:01:00.860> here<00:01:01.130> and<00:01:01.570> we'll

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
is I'm gonna go over here and we'll

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.669 
is I'm gonna go over here and we'll
start<00:01:02.660> out<00:01:02.840> with<00:01:02.870> shelter<00:01:03.410> so<00:01:03.650> shelter<00:01:04.609> is<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:05.679> a

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
start out with shelter so shelter is a a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.120 
start out with shelter so shelter is a a
clam<00:01:07.460> moister<00:01:08.060> type<00:01:08.299> Pokemon<00:01:08.719> um<00:01:09.100> he's<00:01:10.100> the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
clam moister type Pokemon um he's the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.279 
clam moister type Pokemon um he's the
smallest<00:01:10.579> form<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.829> his<00:01:13.119> species<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.020> there's

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
smallest form of his species so there's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.039 
smallest form of his species so there's
no<00:01:15.380> smaller<00:01:15.969> evolution<00:01:16.969> and<00:01:17.210> what<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:17.929> want

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
no smaller evolution and what you want

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.739 
no smaller evolution and what you want
to<00:01:18.079> do<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.380> hold<00:01:18.920> out<00:01:19.159> your<00:01:19.189> war<00:01:19.460> zone<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.969> make

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
to do is hold out your war zone and make

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.630 
to do is hold out your war zone and make
sure<00:01:20.899> you<00:01:21.049> capture<00:01:21.409> them<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.890> can<00:01:22.100> do<00:01:22.219> once

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
sure you capture them you can do once

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.279 
sure you capture them you can do once
you<00:01:22.759> capture<00:01:22.969> two<00:01:23.149> shelter<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.719> right-click

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
you capture two shelter and right-click

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.099 
you capture two shelter and right-click
him<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.039> should<00:01:25.280> say<00:01:25.810> your<00:01:26.810> shelters

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
him and it should say your shelters

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.270 
him and it should say your shelters
evolving<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.890> will<00:01:27.979> play<00:01:28.130> this

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
evolving and then it will play this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.029 
evolving and then it will play this
really<00:01:28.939> cool<00:01:29.210> animation<00:01:29.810> where<00:01:30.499> where<00:01:31.009> a

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
really cool animation where where a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.959 
really cool animation where where a
shelter<00:01:31.670> will<00:01:32.200> he'll<00:01:33.579> consume<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.759> water

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
shelter will he'll consume the water

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.679 
shelter will he'll consume the water
stone<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.600> they'll<00:01:36.200> act<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:36.590> him<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:36.950> he<00:01:37.100> will

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
magically just poof up into a cloister

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.039 
magically just poof up into a cloister
now<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.229> cool<00:01:42.469> how<00:01:42.590> he<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:43.009> um<00:01:44.049> becomes

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
now it's cool how he just um becomes

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.840 
now it's cool how he just um becomes
like<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.429> because<00:01:46.429> I<00:01:46.819> mean<00:01:47.630> that's<00:01:47.899> sick<00:01:48.139> so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
like that because I mean that's sick so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.120 
like that because I mean that's sick so
that's<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.969> cloister<00:01:50.450> as<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.719> can<00:01:50.840> see

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
that's a cloister as you can see

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.730 
that's a cloister as you can see
cloister<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.219> also<00:01:52.579> a<00:01:52.609> shell<00:01:53.479> type<00:01:53.740> hoister

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
cloister is also a shell type hoister

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.399 
cloister is also a shell type hoister
type<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.130> guess<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:56.600> don't<00:01:57.109> think<00:01:57.229> he

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
type I guess and I don't think he

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.899 
type I guess and I don't think he
learned<00:01:57.499> that<00:01:57.649> he<00:01:57.770> moves<00:01:58.009> upon<00:01:59.439> um<00:02:00.909> upon

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
learned that he moves upon um upon

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.410 
learned that he moves upon um upon
getting<00:02:02.560> upon<00:02:03.560> evolving<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.850> could<00:02:04.999> see<00:02:05.209> that

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
getting upon evolving you could see that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.660 
getting upon evolving you could see that
his<00:02:05.600> moves<00:02:05.899> are<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:06.200> he's<00:02:06.619> will<00:02:06.770> hear<00:02:07.340> water

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
his moves are like he's will hear water

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.270 
his moves are like he's will hear water
and<00:02:07.999> ice<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.080> before<00:02:09.379> he<00:02:09.530> was<00:02:09.619> just<00:02:09.769> water<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
and ice so before he was just water and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.190 
and ice so before he was just water and
once<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.909> get<00:02:11.000> closer<00:02:11.269> he<00:02:11.540> becomes<00:02:11.780> ice<00:02:11.959> type

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
once you get closer he becomes ice type

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.320 
once you get closer he becomes ice type
so

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.290 
so

star u is a really cool he's a starfish

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.650 
star u is a really cool he's a starfish
Pokemon<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.760> right-click<00:02:28.000> star<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
Pokemon and you can right-click star you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.100 
Pokemon and you can right-click star you
and<00:02:28.900> it'll<00:02:29.890> start<00:02:30.040> evolving<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.990> will

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and it'll start evolving and it will

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.630 
and it'll start evolving and it will
evolve<00:02:32.380> into<00:02:32.650> evolve

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
evolve into evolve

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.810 
evolve into evolve
it'll<00:02:34.120> evolve<00:02:34.390> into<00:02:34.870> star<00:02:35.200> me<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.160> star<00:02:36.430> me<00:02:36.610> is

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
it'll evolve into star me so star me is

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.380 
it'll evolve into star me so star me is
also<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:38.500> type<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.980> think<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.270> has

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
also this type I think this is it has

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.360 
also this type I think this is it has
the<00:02:40.510> same<00:02:40.660> reaction<00:02:40.900> he's<00:02:41.470> water<00:02:41.950> right<00:02:42.190> now

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the same reaction he's water right now

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.140 
the same reaction he's water right now
and<00:02:42.640> he<00:02:42.910> becomes<00:02:43.240> ice<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:44.680> star<00:02:45.280> me<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.640> no

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and he becomes ice because star me is no

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.660 
and he becomes ice because star me is no
psychics<00:02:46.750> like<00:02:47.070> stories<00:02:48.070> also<00:02:48.190> psychic<00:02:48.550> he's

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
psychics like stories also psychic he's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.860 
psychics like stories also psychic he's
amazing<00:02:49.740> it's<00:02:50.740> like<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:51.070> haven't<00:02:51.250> been<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
amazing it's like I haven't been the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.720 
amazing it's like I haven't been the
pixel<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:52.990> server<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:54.220> that's<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.610> different

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
pixel on server but that's a different

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.660 
pixel on server but that's a different
story<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.209> um<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.100> what<00:02:57.220> Starman<00:02:57.520> looks

water psyching for here's just water

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.290 
water psyching for here's just water
now<00:03:05.980> we're<00:03:06.250> gonna<00:03:06.340> see<00:03:06.490> poly<00:03:06.730> world<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.180> will

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
now we're gonna see poly world I will

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.540 
now we're gonna see poly world I will
see<00:03:07.420> if<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:07.720> poly<00:03:07.990> world<00:03:08.290> when<00:03:08.380> he<00:03:08.530> balls<00:03:08.740> so

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
see if it's poly world when he balls so

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.240 
see if it's poly world when he balls so
let's<00:03:09.730> take<00:03:09.910> back<00:03:10.170> ghost<00:03:11.170> army<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.740> bring<00:03:12.070> out

let's take back ghost army and bring out

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.330 
let's take back ghost army and bring out
poly<00:03:12.610> world<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.000> Polly<00:03:13.209> world<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:14.340> swirly

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
poly world so Polly world is a swirly

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.280 
poly world so Polly world is a swirly
fadoodled<00:03:15.880> hypo<00:03:16.270> human<00:03:16.570> whatever<00:03:17.020> that<00:03:17.170> means

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
fadoodled hypo human whatever that means

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.990 
fadoodled hypo human whatever that means
and<00:03:17.489> let's<00:03:18.489> see<00:03:18.610> what<00:03:18.700> happens<00:03:18.910> in

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
and let's see what happens in

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.210 
and let's see what happens in
development<00:03:19.510> he<00:03:19.690> um<00:03:19.989> he<00:03:20.590> doesn't<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.950> smaller

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
development he um he doesn't a smaller

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.410 
development he um he doesn't a smaller
evolution<00:03:21.850> which<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.000> poliwag<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:24.180> he<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.300> the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
evolution which is poliwag and he is the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.360 
evolution which is poliwag and he is the
middle<00:03:25.600> evolution<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.440> you'll<00:03:27.160> need<00:03:27.310> a

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
middle evolution so you'll need a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.130 
middle evolution so you'll need a
poliwag<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.030> evolve<00:03:28.300> into<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.540> poly<00:03:28.750> world<00:03:29.019> by

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
poliwag to evolve into a poly world by

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.610 
poliwag to evolve into a poly world by
training<00:03:29.560> him<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.860> once<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.340> use<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:31.500> once<00:03:32.500> you

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
training him and once you use a once you

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.590 
training him and once you use a once you
get<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.800> poly<00:03:33.070> world<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.730> use<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> water<00:03:34.390> stone

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
get a poly world you use a water stone

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.170 
get a poly world you use a water stone
to<00:03:34.810> make<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.080> into<00:03:35.260> poliwrath<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.180> Poliwrath

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
to make it into poliwrath and Poliwrath

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.430 
to make it into poliwrath and Poliwrath
is<00:03:37.480> very<00:03:37.930> cool<00:03:38.200> he<00:03:38.410> looks<00:03:38.650> he's<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.640> more

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
is very cool he looks he's like a more

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.940 
is very cool he looks he's like a more
rift<00:03:41.440> version<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.250> poly<00:03:43.090> world<00:03:43.360> he's<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.650> he

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
rift version of poly world he's so he

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.430 
rift version of poly world he's so he
hit<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.160> gym<00:03:45.340> with<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> water<00:03:46.660> stone<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.170> um

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
hit the gym with the water stone so um

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.790 
hit the gym with the water stone so um
that's<00:03:48.190> what<00:03:48.400> poliwag<00:03:48.820> is<00:03:49.380> Poliwrath<00:03:50.410> he

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
that's what poliwag is Poliwrath he

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.320 
that's what poliwag is Poliwrath he
looks<00:03:51.010> pretty<00:03:51.489> cool<00:03:51.840> was<00:03:52.840> just<00:03:53.019> making<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.290> time

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
looks pretty cool was just making a time

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.380 
looks pretty cool was just making a time
point<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:57.030> let's<00:03:58.030> look<00:03:58.360> at<00:03:58.510> his<00:03:58.600> stats<00:04:00.239> he<00:04:01.239> is

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
point and let's look at his stats he is

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.240 
point and let's look at his stats he is
fighting<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.110> water<00:04:02.380> type<00:04:02.650> Pokemon<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.220> i

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
fighting and water type Pokemon so i

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.190 
fighting and water type Pokemon so i
went<00:04:03.430> from<00:04:03.489> water<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:04.450> water<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.810> fighting<00:04:05.170> a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
went from water to water and fighting a

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.130 
went from water to water and fighting a
TV<00:04:05.769> is<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.950> normal-type<00:04:06.370> pokémon<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.989> can

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
TV is a normal-type pokémon so you can

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.680 
TV is a normal-type pokémon so you can
assume<00:04:08.769> that<00:04:08.830> using<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.700> water<00:04:09.910> stone<00:04:10.239> is<00:04:10.480> going

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
assume that using a water stone is going

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.070 
assume that using a water stone is going
to<00:04:10.780> make<00:04:10.930> easy<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.440> water<00:04:11.739> type<00:04:11.950> Pokemon<00:04:12.000> now

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
to make easy a water type Pokemon now
