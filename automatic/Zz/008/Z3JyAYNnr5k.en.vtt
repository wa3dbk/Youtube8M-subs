00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.630 

at<00:00:47.020> this<00:00:47.230> point<00:00:47.500> in<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.860> assembly<00:00:48.340> you<00:00:48.520> would

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
at this point in the assembly you would

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.390 
at this point in the assembly you would
want<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:49.000> install<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.630> front<00:00:49.900> slant<00:00:50.500> panel

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.590 

that<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.470> using<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.600> bolts

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that is going to all be using two bolts

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:08.219 
that is going to all be using two bolts
with<00:00:57.870> losses<00:00:58.640> and<00:01:00.350> nuts<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.740> backside

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.529 

now<00:01:08.799> that<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.280> bolts<00:01:09.909> have<00:01:10.000> been<00:01:10.060> installed

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
now that the bolts have been installed

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.850 
now that the bolts have been installed

the<00:03:14.830> right<00:03:15.040> side<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.000> again<00:03:16.780> place<00:03:17.140> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the right side on and again place the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.170 
the right side on and again place the
bolts<00:03:17.739> from<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.459> front<00:03:18.819> bracket<00:03:19.709> through

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
bolts from the front bracket through

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.860 
bolts from the front bracket through
and<00:03:22.299> again<00:03:22.780> using<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.700> 5/16<00:03:24.700> flat<00:03:25.269> washers

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
and again using the 5/16 flat washers

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580 
and again using the 5/16 flat washers

our<00:03:37.570> next<00:03:37.870> step<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.350> install<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.920> key<00:03:39.310> onto

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
our next step is to install the key onto

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.740 
our next step is to install the key onto
the<00:03:40.090> beetle<00:03:40.480> itself<00:03:43.170> into<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> free<00:03:44.470> Peck

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.080 
the beetle itself into the free Peck
area<00:03:46.750> on<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.380> beater<00:03:47.710> then<00:03:48.340> you're<00:03:48.580> going<00:03:48.760> to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
area on the beater then you're going to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:04:01.290 
area on the beater then you're going to
slide<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:50.380> pulley<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.220> plate
