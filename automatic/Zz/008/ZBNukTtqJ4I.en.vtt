putting<00:02:31.530> plastic<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.130> metal<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.610> I'm<00:02:32.700> not

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
putting plastic on metal so I'm not

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.160 
putting plastic on metal so I'm not
going<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.000> take<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> chance<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.660> my<00:02:33.750> wraps<00:02:33.959> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
going to take a chance of my wraps and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.240 
going to take a chance of my wraps and
teflon<00:02:34.500> tape<00:02:34.680> around<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.100> first<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:38.069> here's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
teflon tape around this first so here's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.500 
teflon tape around this first so here's
some<00:02:38.400> teflon<00:02:38.790> tape<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.300> can<00:02:39.390> buy

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
some teflon tape but you can buy

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.949 
some teflon tape but you can buy
hardware<00:02:40.019> stores<00:02:40.350> or<00:02:40.470> plying<00:02:40.830> stores<00:02:41.959> yeah

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
hardware stores or plying stores yeah

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.850 
hardware stores or plying stores yeah
white<00:02:43.410> tape<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:45.209> not<00:02:45.360> sticky<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.019> what

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
white tape here it's not sticky but what

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.350 
white tape here it's not sticky but what
it<00:02:46.950> does<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.819> fills<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.750> eight<00:02:49.620> holes

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
it does is it fills in the eight holes

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.000 
it does is it fills in the eight holes
so<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.480> kinda<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.290> putty<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.830> it's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
so it's kinda like a but putty but it's

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.190 
so it's kinda like a but putty but it's
a<00:02:53.160> lot<00:02:53.370> easier<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.000> use<00:02:54.120> them<00:02:54.299> play<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.660> it's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
a lot easier to use them play and it's

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.750 
a lot easier to use them play and it's
easier<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> remove<00:02:55.709> afterwards<00:02:56.250> too<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:56.640> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
easier to remove afterwards too if you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.479 
easier to remove afterwards too if you
need<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.200> now<00:02:58.200> when<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.500> put<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.739> teflon<00:02:59.160> tape

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
need to now when you put on teflon tape

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.100 
need to now when you put on teflon tape
it's<00:02:59.730> important<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.329> put<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's important that you put it on in the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.720 
it's important that you put it on in the
right<00:03:01.290> direction<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.579> direction

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
right direction in the right direction

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.979 
right direction in the right direction
is<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> direction<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.600> you're<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:03.840> to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
is the direction that you're going to

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.380 
is the direction that you're going to
screw<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> thing<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.790> I'm<00:03:06.000> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.209> screw

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
screw the thing on so I'm going to screw

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.890 
screw the thing on so I'm going to screw
it<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.989> clockwise<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.579> wrap<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> tape<00:03:09.720> on

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it in on clockwise so wrap the tape on

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080 
it in on clockwise so wrap the tape on
clockwise<00:03:10.500> also<00:03:11.340> when<00:03:11.430> you're<00:03:11.519> pretty<00:03:11.700> teflon

overlapping use any overlapping will
plug<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.109> hole

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:38.250 

I'm<00:03:28.690> nice<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.140> flat<00:03:29.410> there<00:03:31.380> attention<00:03:37.260> let's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.699 

there<00:03:57.700> we<00:03:57.790> go

well it's plastics and I want to go too

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.280 
well it's plastics and I want to go too
too<00:04:24.850> tight<00:04:25.120> otherwise<00:04:25.300> we'll<00:04:25.720> crack<00:04:26.080> the

voice you might actually break the
plastics<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:00.910> don't<00:05:01.060> go<00:05:01.180> too<00:05:01.240> tight

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.020 

that's<00:05:05.380> thinner<00:05:05.650> tight<00:05:05.950> like<00:05:06.130> that

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.700 

you<00:05:10.480> know<00:05:10.780> turn<00:05:10.990> yellow<00:05:11.170> when<00:05:11.320> you're<00:05:11.560> doing

and<00:05:21.450> she'll<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:21.900> good<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.350> want<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.100> test<00:05:23.310> it

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.220 

okay<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:33.040> had<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.250> leak<00:05:33.520> so<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.150> simply<00:05:34.930> took

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
okay so I had a leak so I simply took

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.770 
okay so I had a leak so I simply took
the<00:05:35.290> water<00:05:35.890> pump<00:05:36.100> pliers<00:05:36.220> and<00:05:36.700> tighten<00:05:37.690> this

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
the water pump pliers and tighten this

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.180 
the water pump pliers and tighten this
up<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:38.050> little<00:05:38.260> more<00:05:38.440> as<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:38.680> can<00:05:38.800> see<00:05:39.040> it's

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
up a little more as you can see it's

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.830 
up a little more as you can see it's
twisted<00:05:39.940> quite<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.180> bit<00:05:40.300> more<00:05:40.480> that<00:05:40.630> way

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
twisted quite a bit more that way

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.170 
twisted quite a bit more that way
and<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.740> seems<00:05:41.980> to<00:05:42.070> have<00:05:42.220> fixed<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.550> so<00:05:42.850> let<00:05:43.120> me

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
and it seems to have fixed it so let me

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.300 
and it seems to have fixed it so let me
just<00:05:43.360> demonstrate<00:05:43.750> that

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.420
