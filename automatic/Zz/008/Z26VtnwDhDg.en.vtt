00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
talk about maybe a slightly different

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.760 
talk about maybe a slightly different
millwall<00:05:12.700> instead<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:14.020> what<00:05:15.020> their<00:05:15.470> mind

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770

lingers<00:05:16.370> back<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.850> in<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:17.870> past<00:05:18.110> because<00:05:18.680> I'd

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
lingers back to in the past because I'd

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.250 
lingers back to in the past because I'd
like<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.760> say<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.180> we<00:05:20.570> had<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.720> problem<00:05:20.990> in

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
like to say that we had a problem in

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.970 
like to say that we had a problem in
society<00:05:21.410> then<00:05:22.210> which<00:05:23.210> people<00:05:23.630> a<00:05:23.900> lot<00:05:24.860> of

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
society then which people a lot of

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.180 
society then which people a lot of
people<00:05:25.310> from<00:05:26.060> different<00:05:26.480> clubs

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
people from different clubs

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.650 
people from different clubs
unfortunately<00:05:28.190> thought<00:05:28.940> they<00:05:29.150> could<00:05:29.420> use

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
unfortunately thought they could use

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.080 
unfortunately thought they could use
football<00:05:30.350> as<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.620> vehicle<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.250> be<00:05:31.280> violent<00:05:31.790> you

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
football as a vehicle to be violent you

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.450 
football as a vehicle to be violent you
know<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.510> from<00:05:33.290> my<00:05:33.470> point<00:05:33.740> of<00:05:33.860> view<00:05:33.920> I<00:05:34.040> think

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
know so from my point of view I think

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.730 
know so from my point of view I think
that<00:05:34.670> this<00:05:35.330> club<00:05:35.630> has<00:05:35.690> been<00:05:35.810> tarnished<00:05:36.260> and

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
that this club has been tarnished and

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.620 
that this club has been tarnished and
there's<00:05:37.370> lots<00:05:37.610> of<00:05:37.700> other<00:05:37.850> clubs<00:05:38.090> who<00:05:38.240> had<00:05:38.390> that

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
there's lots of other clubs who had that

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.660 
there's lots of other clubs who had that
and<00:05:38.840> it<00:05:39.140> went<00:05:39.350> to<00:05:39.830> different<00:05:40.160> countries<00:05:40.310> as

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
and it went to different countries as

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.430 
and it went to different countries as
well<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.090> now<00:05:41.300> I<00:05:41.330> don't<00:05:41.510> feel<00:05:41.690> we've<00:05:42.050> got<00:05:42.230> that

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
well and now I don't feel we've got that

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.640 
well and now I don't feel we've got that
so<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:44.210> know<00:05:44.300> hopefully<00:05:44.480> I<00:05:44.720> can<00:05:44.840> actually<00:05:45.380> add

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
so you know hopefully I can actually add

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.080 
so you know hopefully I can actually add
a<00:05:45.680> way<00:05:45.980> of<00:05:46.130> playing<00:05:46.250> that<00:05:46.580> will<00:05:46.730> make<00:05:46.880> people

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
a way of playing that will make people

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.170 
a way of playing that will make people
want<00:05:47.270> to<00:05:48.050> spend<00:05:48.140> money<00:05:48.500> on<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:49.130> grow<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:49.880> crowd

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
want to spend money on to grow the crowd

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.690 
want to spend money on to grow the crowd
to<00:05:51.020> build<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.560> be<00:05:51.680> proud<00:05:51.890> of<00:05:52.100> something<00:05:52.370> else
