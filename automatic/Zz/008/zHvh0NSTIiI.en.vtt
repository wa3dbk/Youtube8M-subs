00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 remember for now the impact was the same as the director 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.380
 pedagogical and technical preventive I have my first club contest 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.200
 african is at his first driving lessons echoes woerth announces that I 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.080
 offers you to redo a first course to promote the euro saves 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.179
 a number of data 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.989
 I will propose you to redo it and to continue this course by giving you 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.570
 some tips for eco driving and I hope 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.880
 what we will get a good in terms of carbon emissions anyway I'm going 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.940
 make efforts I do not know her hide the magnitude and consistent in the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 prevention approach and exchanging real driving situation 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.660
 you will start the car 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.100
 we start we pass the first it would find the point of 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.920
 skating 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 we accelerate we stall each year here is a patient had in the past 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.790
 acceleration we accelerate a little bit later the army that's 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.350
 will find for skating we launch the car we do not go 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.360
 we will make a journey that lasts about a minute a minute and thirty years 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.389
 I let you drive driving as you usually drive 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.399
 and percent from there i will give you sÃ¨ye this case that the 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.110
 third 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.160
 it's the 3d on 3 screens with a vision a panoramic vision 15 a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.659
 Realism at the pedals 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.659
 for his great realism level of imagery also 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.710
 to generate too messy to rearview mirror rear vision 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.920
 so what are we going to look for on this type of route? 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.479
 it is to make you realize a top course between kim and pitfalls 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.270
 ie slowdowns of accelerations 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 stops and precisely to generate the the interested it assizes is very 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.820
 strong 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.800
 that's what can happen to us as well on an hour on a road 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.549
 the country 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.439
 at the last moment the motorist does not know where he goes starlings at 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.240
 last moment 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.490
 you get to the end of the lionel journey you go% and I'll go 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.710
 describe a little bit yielded his goals 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.729
 from there you will resume the course and implement them 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.259
 it's really an eco-driving awareness 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.530
 these to give you for 100 euros will say 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.470
 60 70% of eco-driving bases from there you will be able to 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.950
 implement and measure directly on your 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.659
 today culpa was spread over tf1 en i already give you the first 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.030
 first advice 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.060
 it's going to be to keep your Christmas count in the green area that indicated 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.030
 here between 1000 and 2000 perfect rounds to compensate for the defense one can 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.049
 consume meaning and the second largest council of the EU 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.339
 eco-driving is what is called releasing the accelerator 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.349
 that is to say the injection cutoff that is to say as you have a report 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.959
 of engaged box for example 4th you see the fire that revolted what you 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.469
 do you stay in the fourth you let go of your accelerator 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.680
 the saucer injectors I have little engine braking on recent engines 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.609
 clairoix drives the renault engine which has more fuel that is injected and 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.439
 and then the other thing is the stability of the speed that if I compared to the 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.200
 bicycle when I ride a bike 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.530
 when I roll at 20km lock is easy to 20 shots this speed if I stop 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 to regain the 20 km it took a lot of energy in the car 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.970
 exactly the same so why can we see my balance sheet then we 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.970
 first continue the course for one minute thirty years of power 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.970
 compare and we'll see Sunday we're here 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.119
 it's going to be important to look at the profile of the road the road starts to 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.359
 go down what am I doing here i can let go of the accelerator 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.529
 and you see that 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.219
 the onboard computer tells you a cut off the injection and I do not consume 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.749
 nothing 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 it must be well launched until 2000 for a boxer is important to watch the 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.290
 profile of the hat of the road entrances in formation this couple this 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.479
 seems 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.539
 learn to have a driving 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.470
 gold coolest and most flexible 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.430
 less gasoline have not done and can be counted on stations 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.010
 one of the order of 20 to 30% depending on the type of conduct and type of course 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.219
 we had 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.329
 if I take 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.090
 the postmen with whom we work 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.920
 then got 15% gains in consumption reduction I propose you 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.110
 not stop there we'll go see the results an agreement so look 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.019
 it's quite interesting if I look at those 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.139
 this table were elected per cent at 3000 rounds average speed of 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.120
 engine rotation we went on the second course after training 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.659
 at 2000 we have the 3% of the accelerator chain so obviously a 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.650
 technique that you practiced little russia arrives at 25% of the time spent in 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.720
 let go of the accelerator you had heavy foot and I come with one foot 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.519
 light when we see that I have progressed 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.680
 so where it's going to be very interesting you were at 215 grams 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.860
 to shit or reject 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.969
 we go to 121 grams including act 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.969
 almost half if I transpose it 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.139
 we know at 2 on the year it's a ton 3-10 demand of its waters of 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.000
 many and that we had and that we saved but it is especially 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.210
 488 euros that I'm going 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.679
 save 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.609
 engaged in the halls for the demonstration the feasts of the 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.280
 Nativity 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.840
 we have a bit the first very particular still a very amazing good point 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.730
 apprentices for 2011
