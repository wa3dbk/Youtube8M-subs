00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.540 

okay<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.020> house<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.200> backfield<00:00:07.890> now<00:00:08.040> and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
okay so the house is backfield now and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.160 
okay so the house is backfield now and
the<00:00:09.030> next<00:00:09.240> thing<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.719> do<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.929> we<00:00:10.050> have

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the next thing we have to do is we have

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.589 
the next thing we have to do is we have
to<00:00:10.200> order<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.620> beam<00:00:10.830> our<00:00:11.190> basement<00:00:12.000> plan<00:00:12.269> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
to order the beam our basement plan and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.330 
to order the beam our basement plan and
our<00:00:12.690> plan<00:00:12.929> shows<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> beam<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:14.099> beam

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
our plan shows a beam we have one beam

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.140 
our plan shows a beam we have one beam
going<00:00:15.000> from<00:00:15.330> beam<00:00:16.109> pocket<00:00:16.670> over<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> other

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
going from beam pocket over to the other

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.019 
going from beam pocket over to the other
beam<00:00:18.390> pocket<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> continuous<00:00:19.830> beam<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.880> we

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
beam pocket it's a continuous beam so we

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.540 
beam pocket it's a continuous beam so we
have<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.359> measure<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> beam<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.260> then<00:00:22.740> meet

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
have to measure the beam and then meet

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.790 
have to measure the beam and then meet
with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.880> steel<00:00:24.300> company<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.019> order<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
with the steel company and order the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.910 
with the steel company and order the
beam<00:00:26.010> all<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.529> I'll<00:00:28.529> show<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
beam all right so I'll show you the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.209 
beam all right so I'll show you the
other<00:00:29.039> beam<00:00:29.250> pocket<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> other<00:00:37.980> end<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
other beam pocket so the other end of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
other beam pocket so the other end of
the<00:00:38.309> beam<00:00:38.489> goes<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.719> we're<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the beam goes here so we're going to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.020 
the beam goes here so we're going to
measure<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.559> length<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> beam<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.550> on

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
measure the length of the beam and on

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
measure the length of the beam and on
the<00:00:42.149> plan<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.600> shows<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.050> we're<00:00:43.230> using<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.770> w<00:00:44.399> 8

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the plan it shows that we're using a w 8

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
the plan it shows that we're using a w 8
by<00:00:44.789> 32<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.469> shows<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.920> gauge<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
by 32 that just shows you the gauge and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
by 32 that just shows you the gauge and
the<00:00:47.430> thickness<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> beam<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the thickness of the beam so that's the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.690 
the thickness of the beam so that's the
first<00:00:49.680> thing<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> next<00:00:50.399> thing<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
first thing or the next thing you have

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
first thing or the next thing you have
to<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:51.120> before<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> Carpenters<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to do before the Carpenters start so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
to do before the Carpenters start so
either<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.850> measure<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.570> your

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
either you can measure that or your

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
either you can measure that or your
carpenter<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.500> measure<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.949> great<00:00:56.850> okay<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
carpenter can measure that great okay so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.810 
carpenter can measure that great okay so
don't<00:00:58.079> forget<00:00:58.260> before<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.370> before

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
don't forget before you have to before

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
don't forget before you have to before
you<00:00:59.940> order<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> lumber<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.079> got<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> make

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you order the lumber you got to make

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
you order the lumber you got to make
sure<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> beams<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.129> place<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.059> got<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
sure the beams in place so you got to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
sure the beams in place so you got to
measure<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> beam<00:01:03.989> either<00:01:04.290> yourself<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
measure the beam either yourself or the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
measure the beam either yourself or the
carpenter<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:06.150> our<00:01:06.299> case<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.750> our<00:01:06.840> plan<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
carpenter in our case in our plan it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.170 
carpenter in our case in our plan it
shows<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.799> beam<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> middle<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
shows one beam going in the middle of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
shows one beam going in the middle of
the<00:01:09.240> house<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.380> beam

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the house so it's going to go from beam

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
the house so it's going to go from beam
pocket<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.280> beam<00:01:11.460> pocket<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> we're

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pocket to beam pocket and we're

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.859 
pocket to beam pocket and we're
measuring<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.060> 30

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
pocket the beam pocket subtract an inch

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
pocket the beam pocket subtract an inch
to<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:30.600> sure<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.869> fits<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> beam<00:01:31.500> pocket

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to make sure it fits in the beam pocket

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.969 
to make sure it fits in the beam pocket
okay<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:33.600> forget<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.380> steel

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
okay so don't forget to see your steel

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
okay so don't forget to see your steel
company<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.180> beam<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
company and get the beam in and it's a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
company and get the beam in and it's a
good<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> good<00:01:37.860> idea<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.270> steel

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
good it's a good idea if your steel

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
good it's a good idea if your steel
company<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> boom<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> beam<00:01:41.939> in

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
company has a boom to put the beam in

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.300 
company has a boom to put the beam in
place<00:01:42.409> sometimes<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.590> carpenters<00:01:44.100> won't

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
place sometimes your carpenters won't

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.230 
place sometimes your carpenters won't
have<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> boom<00:01:46.310> depends<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> site<00:01:47.790> depends

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
have a boom depends on the site depends

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.910 
have a boom depends on the site depends
on<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> carpenter<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> steel<00:01:49.530> company

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
on the carpenter so if the steel company

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370 
on the carpenter so if the steel company
has<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> boom<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.600> easier<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.049> they<00:01:52.200> put

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
has a boom it's a lot easier if they put

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.920 
has a boom it's a lot easier if they put
the<00:01:52.500> beam<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.829> place<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the beam in place for you you know the
