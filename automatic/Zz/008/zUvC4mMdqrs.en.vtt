on<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:19.090> original<00:00:19.750> Xbox

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
on the original Xbox

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.630 
on the original Xbox
the<00:00:22.360> reason<00:00:22.930> I'm<00:00:23.290> playing<00:00:23.950> this<00:00:24.130> really<00:00:24.520> is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
the reason I'm playing this really is

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.580 
the reason I'm playing this really is
out<00:00:24.790> of<00:00:24.820> well<00:00:25.720> just<00:00:25.900> an<00:00:26.020> accident

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
out of well just an accident

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.580 
out of well just an accident
I<00:00:26.700> bought<00:00:27.700> what<00:00:28.450> I<00:00:28.480> thought<00:00:28.779> was<00:00:29.020> the<00:00:29.050> second

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
I bought what I thought was the second

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.130 
I bought what I thought was the second
game<00:00:29.740> from<00:00:30.610> our<00:00:30.759> local<00:00:31.270> computer<00:00:31.480> exchange

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
game from our local computer exchange

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.210 
game from our local computer exchange
because<00:00:32.349> I've<00:00:32.410> never<00:00:32.529> played<00:00:32.829> that<00:00:32.890> one

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
because I've never played that one

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.830 
because I've never played that one
before<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:33.579> thought<00:00:33.790> I'll<00:00:33.940> give<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.300> try<00:00:34.570> and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
before I thought I'll give it a try and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.870 
before I thought I'll give it a try and
they<00:00:35.410> put<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.920> wrong<00:00:36.100> version<00:00:36.399> of<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.730> game

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
they put the wrong version of the game

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.510 
they put the wrong version of the game
in<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.120> box<00:00:37.329> so<00:00:37.690> I've<00:00:38.620> got<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.950> original<00:00:39.010> one

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
in the box so I've got the original one

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.010 
in the box so I've got the original one
and<00:00:39.790> I<00:00:40.690> stuck<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.770> him<00:00:41.950> it<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:43.780> can't

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
and I stuck it on him it really can't

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.500 
and I stuck it on him it really can't
drive<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.380> yeah<00:00:44.890> well<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.850> reminded<00:00:46.329> me<00:00:46.480> that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
drive it yeah well it reminded me that

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.029 
drive it yeah well it reminded me that
this<00:00:46.840> was<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.170> first<00:00:47.410> game<00:00:47.620> that<00:00:47.649> I<00:00:47.859> ever

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
this was the first game that I ever

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.069 
this was the first game that I ever
played<00:00:48.219> on<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.579> original<00:00:48.910> Xbox<00:00:48.969> back<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.019> the

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
played on the original Xbox back in the

played on the original Xbox back in the
day<00:00:50.230> so<00:00:50.679> ten<00:00:51.010> years<00:00:51.039> ago<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.839> I<00:00:52.839> remember

seeing at the time and thinking wow this

newfangled<00:00:58.390> X<00:00:59.019> boxes<00:00:59.499> and<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.949> had<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.249> dream

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
newfangled X boxes and I had a dream

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.880 
newfangled X boxes and I had a dream
caster<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.969> timing<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.660> was<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.960> student<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.589> I

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
caster the timing I was a student and I

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.470 
caster the timing I was a student and I
spent<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.699> lot<00:01:04.510> of<00:01:04.570> my<00:01:05.670> student<00:01:06.670> alone

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
spent a lot of my student alone

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.399 
spent a lot of my student alone
allowance<00:01:08.320> for<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.360> month<00:01:10.659> and<00:01:10.990> lived<00:01:11.260> off

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
allowance for that month and lived off

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.100 
allowance for that month and lived off
beans<00:01:12.120> but<00:01:13.120> it<00:01:13.300> was<00:01:13.450> worth<00:01:13.630> it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
beans but it was worth it

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.389 
beans but it was worth it
and<00:01:14.670> even<00:01:15.670> now<00:01:16.440> this<00:01:17.440> has<00:01:17.620> been<00:01:17.770> played<00:01:18.040> on<00:01:18.070> an

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
and even now this has been played on an

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.539 
and even now this has been played on an
Xbox<00:01:18.820> 360<00:01:19.689> so<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.439> resolutions<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.189> little<00:01:21.430> bit

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
Xbox 360 so the resolutions a little bit

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
Xbox 360 so the resolutions a little bit
higher<00:01:21.820> but<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.840> looks<00:01:23.110> brilliant<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.909> if

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
higher but it looks brilliant I think if

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.609 
higher but it looks brilliant I think if
I'd<00:01:26.320> have<00:01:26.560> bought<00:01:26.770> an<00:01:27.180> original<00:01:28.229> 360<00:01:29.229> game<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
I'd have bought an original 360 game and

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.889 
I'd have bought an original 360 game and
it<00:01:29.710> looked<00:01:30.130> like<00:01:30.189> this<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.939> wouldn't<00:01:31.750> be

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
it looked like this I wouldn't be

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:41.039 
it looked like this I wouldn't be
disappointed<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:39.130> think<00:01:39.820> well<00:01:40.479> personally<00:01:40.930> I

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
disappointed I think well personally I

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.620 
disappointed I think well personally I
think<00:01:41.399> even<00:01:42.399> though<00:01:42.549> this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.909> rally<00:01:43.210> sport

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
think even though this is a rally sport

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.719 
think even though this is a rally sport
game<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:46.200> its<00:01:47.200> rally<00:01:47.619> mode<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.189> think<00:01:48.219> is

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
game it's its rally mode I think is

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.120 
game it's its rally mode I think is
better<00:01:49.360> than<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.930> lot<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.500> recent<00:01:50.829> Colin

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
better than a lot of the recent Colin

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.359 
better than a lot of the recent Colin
McRae<00:01:51.430> games<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.439> ones<00:01:53.649> on<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.009> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
McRae games I think the ones on the the

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.819 
McRae games I think the ones on the the
Xbox<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.299> Playstation<00:01:55.899> 2<00:01:55.930> were<00:01:56.289> pretty<00:01:56.560> good

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
Xbox and Playstation 2 were pretty good

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.959 
Xbox and Playstation 2 were pretty good
but<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.939> ones<00:01:58.119> on<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.039> 360<00:02:00.039> I<00:02:00.070> wasn't<00:02:00.549> that

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
but the ones on the 360 I wasn't that

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.240 
but the ones on the 360 I wasn't that
impressed<00:02:01.119> with<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.969> I<00:02:04.000> think<00:02:04.359> that<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
impressed with but I think that this

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.270 
impressed with but I think that this
game<00:02:06.630> really<00:02:07.680> got<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.800> balance<00:02:09.009> right

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
game really got the balance right

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.990 
game really got the balance right
between<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.960> rallying<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.920> more<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.640> an

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
between the rallying and a more of an

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.310 
between the rallying and a more of an
RKG<00:02:13.390> style<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.200> perhaps<00:02:15.750> maybe<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.930> could<00:02:17.110> see

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
RKG style so perhaps maybe you could see

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.220 
RKG style so perhaps maybe you could see
this<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> spiritual<00:02:18.610> successor<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.300> Sega

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
this as a spiritual successor to Sega

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.990 
this as a spiritual successor to Sega
Rally<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.740> wasn't<00:02:21.310> really<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.520> fan<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
Rally I wasn't really a fan of the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.680 
Rally I wasn't really a fan of the
second<00:02:22.360> game<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> Dreamcast<00:02:23.020> those

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
second game on the Dreamcast those

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.270 
second game on the Dreamcast those
the<00:02:25.110> framerate<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.740> bit<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.040> over<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the framerate was a bit all over the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.400 
the framerate was a bit all over the
place<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.880> there<00:02:27.750> are<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> few<00:02:28.050> things<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
place and there are a few things I

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.380 
place and there are a few things I
thought<00:02:28.620> were<00:02:28.830> not<00:02:29.370> as<00:02:29.520> good<00:02:29.580> with<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> second

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
thought were not as good with the second

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.350 
thought were not as good with the second
one<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.830> brilliant<00:02:32.490> I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.620 

think<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.960> case<00:02:37.770> where<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.640> probably<00:02:39.390> said

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
think it's a case where I probably said

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.050 
think it's a case where I probably said
this<00:02:39.720> before<00:02:39.960> using<00:02:40.590> quake<00:02:41.070> 2<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.490> an<00:02:41.730> example

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
this before using quake 2 as an example

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.650 
this before using quake 2 as an example
if<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> game<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> CRT<00:02:44.760> tell<00:02:45.390> you're

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
if you see a game on a CRT tell you're

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.290 
if you see a game on a CRT tell you're
an<00:02:45.810> old<00:02:45.960> Italian<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.680> low-resolution<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.880> can

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
an old Italian a low-resolution it can

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.090 
an old Italian a low-resolution it can
sometimes<00:02:48.570> look<00:02:49.020> better<00:02:49.350> than<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.860> play

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
sometimes look better than if you play

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.570 
sometimes look better than if you play
it<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.310> high<00:02:50.490> resolution<00:02:50.730> city<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:53.280> shows

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
it in high resolution city so it shows

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.830 
it in high resolution city so it shows
off<00:02:53.790> some<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> plainness<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
off some of the plainness in the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.470 
off some of the plainness in the
graphics<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.640> think<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.090> happening

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
graphics and I think this is happening

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680 
graphics and I think this is happening
here<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:58.080> too<00:02:58.410> much

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
here but not too much

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.020 
here but not too much
it<00:03:00.690> still<00:03:00.930> looks<00:03:01.110> impressive<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:02.280> number<00:03:02.940> of

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it still looks impressive the number of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.700 
it still looks impressive the number of
hours<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.360> must<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.660> put<00:03:03.810> into<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.170> game<00:03:04.410> I

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
hours I must have put into this game I

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.430 
hours I must have put into this game I
remember<00:03:05.780> getting<00:03:06.780> rid<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.200> I've

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
remember getting rid of it because I've

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.790 
remember getting rid of it because I've
just<00:03:07.590> played<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.100> death<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.850> think<00:03:12.180> that

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
just played it to death but I think that

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.690 
just played it to death but I think that
it's<00:03:13.800> still<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.550> challenge<00:03:15.240> even<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:15.720> Oh<00:03:16.700> nope

don't<00:05:37.140> remember<00:05:37.380> this<00:05:37.620> game<00:05:38.040> being<00:05:38.220> quite<00:05:38.520> so

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
don't remember this game being quite so

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:46.850 
don't remember this game being quite so
forgiving<00:05:39.300> ah<00:05:43.700> but<00:05:44.700> I<00:05:44.730> think<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.620> later

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
forgiving ah but I think the the later

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.910 
forgiving ah but I think the the later
dirt<00:05:47.400> games<00:05:48.890> the<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:51.230> won't<00:05:52.230> say<00:05:52.380> cheap<00:05:52.740> in

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
dirt games the the I won't say cheap in

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.710 
dirt games the the I won't say cheap in
the<00:05:53.040> way<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:53.340> they<00:05:53.460> play<00:05:53.700> but<00:05:53.760> there<00:05:54.600> are

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
the way that they play but there are

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.950 
the way that they play but there are
some<00:05:54.930> corners<00:05:55.200> that<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:56.000> just<00:05:57.000> you've<00:05:57.690> got<00:05:57.720> to

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
some corners that you just you've got to

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.070 
some corners that you just you've got to
do<00:05:58.050> absolutely<00:05:58.200> perfect<00:05:59.100> on<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.600> get<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.630> decent

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
do absolutely perfect on to get a decent

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.800 
do absolutely perfect on to get a decent
time<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.760> I<00:06:02.760> think<00:06:02.910> this<00:06:03.240> is<00:06:03.390> why<00:06:03.540> they've<00:06:03.780> had

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
time and I think this is why they've had

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.800 
time and I think this is why they've had
to<00:06:04.140> go<00:06:04.170> for<00:06:04.440> that<00:06:04.560> flashback<00:06:04.920> thing<00:06:05.880> where<00:06:06.150> you

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
to go for that flashback thing where you

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.560 
to go for that flashback thing where you
can<00:06:07.050> flashback<00:06:08.010> like<00:06:08.040> 10<00:06:08.610> seconds<00:06:09.120> or<00:06:09.240> 5

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
can flashback like 10 seconds or 5

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.060 
can flashback like 10 seconds or 5
seconds<00:06:09.960> and<00:06:10.140> correct<00:06:10.380> what<00:06:10.500> you've<00:06:10.680> done<00:06:10.860> in

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
seconds and correct what you've done in

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.990 
seconds and correct what you've done in
that<00:06:12.470> it<00:06:13.470> does<00:06:13.710> suggest<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:14.400> there's

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
that it does suggest that there's

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.790 
that it does suggest that there's
something<00:06:15.240> wrong<00:06:15.600> in<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.200> game<00:06:16.380> design

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
something wrong in the the game design

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.340 
something wrong in the the game design
there<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.430> mean<00:06:17.940> games<00:06:18.600> in<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.840> past<00:06:19.020> didn't

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
there I mean games in the past didn't

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.610 
there I mean games in the past didn't
really<00:06:19.560> suffer<00:06:19.919> from<00:06:20.040> that<00:06:21.440> not<00:06:22.440> that<00:06:22.560> I'm

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
really suffer from that not that I'm

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.200 
really suffer from that not that I'm
saying<00:06:22.830> that<00:06:23.040> they're<00:06:23.190> bad<00:06:23.400> games<00:06:23.730> that<00:06:23.970> I

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
saying that they're bad games that I

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.360 
saying that they're bad games that I
think<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.230> good<00:06:25.440> that<00:06:25.740> they<00:06:25.860> are<00:06:25.890> good<00:06:26.190> games

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
think the good that they are good games

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.900 
think the good that they are good games
by<00:06:26.700> I<00:06:27.030> just<00:06:27.419> don't<00:06:28.160> they<00:06:29.160> don't<00:06:29.370> quite<00:06:29.700> work

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
by I just don't they don't quite work

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.020 
by I just don't they don't quite work
for<00:06:29.970> me<00:06:32.450> but<00:06:33.450> this<00:06:33.630> does<00:06:33.840> and<00:06:34.400> now<00:06:35.400> I<00:06:35.430> really

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
for me but this does and now I really

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.090 
for me but this does and now I really
want<00:06:36.360> to<00:06:36.450> play<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.750> second<00:06:37.110> game<00:06:37.140> I'll<00:06:37.800> see<00:06:38.010> if

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
want to play the second game I'll see if

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.700 
want to play the second game I'll see if
I<00:06:38.220> can<00:06:38.430> get<00:06:39.060> hold<00:06:39.240> of<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.479> somewhere<00:06:39.870> the<00:06:40.560> one

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
I can get hold of that somewhere the one

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.909 
I can get hold of that somewhere the one
that<00:06:40.919> is<00:06:41.160> the<00:06:41.340> game<00:06:41.520> and<00:06:41.760> not<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:43.500> first<00:06:43.710> one

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
that is the game and not the first one

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.590 
that is the game and not the first one
bought<00:06:44.100> in<00:06:44.220> the<00:06:44.310> box<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.700> the<00:06:44.729> second<00:06:45.180> so<00:06:45.360> yeah

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
bought in the box of the second so yeah

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.350 
bought in the box of the second so yeah
I<00:06:46.220> think<00:06:47.220> this<00:06:47.460> is<00:06:47.520> the<00:06:47.700> first<00:06:47.940> time<00:06:48.120> that<00:06:48.270> I've

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
I think this is the first time that I've

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.960 
I think this is the first time that I've
looked<00:06:48.540> at<00:06:48.780> an<00:06:48.900> original<00:06:49.169> Xbox<00:06:49.470> game<00:06:50.100> and<00:06:50.310> I<00:06:50.370> my

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
looked at an original Xbox game and I my

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.870 
looked at an original Xbox game and I my
original<00:06:51.330> Xbox<00:06:51.720> well<00:06:52.530> the<00:06:52.950> the<00:06:53.340> optical<00:06:53.729> drive

original Xbox well the the optical drive
died<00:06:54.300> years<00:06:54.570> ago<00:06:55.550> and<00:06:56.550> I've<00:06:57.060> always<00:06:57.270> been<00:06:57.419> a

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
died years ago and I've always been a

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.570 
died years ago and I've always been a
bit<00:06:57.690> reluctant<00:06:57.930> to<00:06:58.229> play<00:06:58.350> games<00:06:58.680> on<00:06:58.830> the<00:06:58.950> 360

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
bit reluctant to play games on the 360

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.810 
bit reluctant to play games on the 360
for<00:06:59.820> the<00:07:00.380> limited<00:07:01.380> compatibility<00:07:02.190> and<00:07:02.340> not

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
for the limited compatibility and not

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.310 
for the limited compatibility and not
always<00:07:03.090> great<00:07:03.300> problems<00:07:03.780> but<00:07:03.930> this<00:07:04.080> place

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
always great problems but this place

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.900 
always great problems but this place
perfect<00:07:04.919> so<00:07:05.790> I<00:07:06.210> might<00:07:06.570> give<00:07:06.810> I<00:07:07.550> might<00:07:08.550> give<00:07:08.729> my

perfect so I might give I might give my

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.930 
perfect so I might give I might give my
original<00:07:09.270> Xbox<00:07:09.660> catalog<00:07:10.169> another<00:07:10.460> looking<00:07:11.460> so

original Xbox catalog another looking so

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.760 
original Xbox catalog another looking so
if<00:07:12.030> you<00:07:12.150> really<00:07:12.300> like<00:07:12.570> rallying<00:07:13.050> games<00:07:13.320> and

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
if you really like rallying games and

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.900 
if you really like rallying games and
you<00:07:14.460> fancy<00:07:14.940> a<00:07:15.710> really<00:07:16.710> just<00:07:16.919> a<00:07:17.040> game<00:07:17.220> that<00:07:17.250> that

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
you fancy a really just a game that that

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.090 
you fancy a really just a game that that
sits<00:07:18.540> somewhere<00:07:18.750> between<00:07:19.080> your<00:07:19.470> PlayStation

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
sits somewhere between your PlayStation

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.070 
sits somewhere between your PlayStation
2<00:07:20.340> style<00:07:20.760> and<00:07:20.970> your<00:07:21.090> modern<00:07:21.390> games<00:07:21.600> this<00:07:21.810> might

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
2 style and your modern games this might

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.670 
2 style and your modern games this might
be<00:07:22.229> at<00:07:22.350> least<00:07:22.380> rate<00:07:22.830> it's<00:07:23.180> it's<00:07:24.180> really<00:07:24.680> very

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
be at least rate it's it's really very

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.159 
be at least rate it's it's really very
similar<00:07:26.190> to<00:07:26.490> Sega<00:07:27.240> Rally<00:07:27.479> in<00:07:27.660> the<00:07:27.780> way<00:07:27.900> that<00:07:28.080> it

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:28.169 
similar to Sega Rally in the way that it

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:29.790 
similar to Sega Rally in the way that it
plays<00:07:28.289> and

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
plays and

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.149 
plays and
I<00:07:29.860> think<00:07:30.159> if<00:07:30.250> you're<00:07:30.659> not<00:07:31.659> a<00:07:31.690> fan<00:07:31.810> of<00:07:32.199> the

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:33.159 
I think if you're not a fan of the

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:35.550 
I think if you're not a fan of the
original<00:07:33.250> Colin<00:07:33.940> McCrea<00:07:34.240> style<00:07:34.659> rally<00:07:35.289> games

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
original Colin McCrea style rally games

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.559 
original Colin McCrea style rally games
like<00:07:35.770> on<00:07:35.889> the<00:07:35.949> PlayStation<00:07:36.669> but<00:07:37.330> you<00:07:37.419> want

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:37.569 
like on the PlayStation but you want

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.770 
like on the PlayStation but you want
something<00:07:37.930> that's<00:07:38.050> a<00:07:38.229> bit<00:07:38.650> more<00:07:39.780> realistic

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:40.780 
something that's a bit more realistic

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.409 
something that's a bit more realistic
than<00:07:40.990> smooth<00:07:41.349> the<00:07:41.740> the<00:07:42.099> more<00:07:42.430> arcade<00:07:43.120> games

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:43.419 
than smooth the the more arcade games

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:46.260 
than smooth the the more arcade games
then<00:07:43.889> arcade-style<00:07:44.889> games<00:07:45.430> then<00:07:45.669> I<00:07:45.759> think<00:07:46.030> you

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270 
then arcade-style games then I think you
