00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.109
 nice guys multidocs and here we are found on that channel with a video 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.390
 of here we are with this I comment on this guys I bring my first 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.210
 video on that i can follow unlike how other youtubers have done though 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.589
 that I have always proposed the usual go say let's be here to give me a for 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.019
 make a video comment where I will give you what I will talk about. of how it is 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.680
 structured the game of what - I understood about the system to the classes and so on 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.850
 so i hope this can't be too boring i thought 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.560
 maybe it could be a little bit more, let's say, I don't know a profit 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.580
 to you 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.340
 just to make you understand a little bit better as the title as a game in itself 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.030
 per se 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.460
 and before doing this for boys if one is all thank you to those behind 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280
 of me you love me allowed. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.119
 to play for this title on PC in this beautiful sluice in fact they gave me 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.530
 just a code. to play it so thanks to them if I am now 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.590
 therefore, seeing this video, this is truly one of my heartfelt thanks 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.430
 time 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.450
 having said that then before thinking with the argument we say with the comment 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 etc 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.210
 one thing that I want to clarify that I think this game deserves one 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 plus you will probably find something more 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.960
 because it is a small extremely fun despite maybe having 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.170
 however defects because cydia defects like all the other games 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.390
 for now i'm not here to talk to you so much about this maybe I'll do it in the future 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.020
 maybe the next I'll never tell you what I like what I don't 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.790
 like it 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.430
 in this we will see more in technical detail how they are structured 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.100
 the classes and so on 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 anyway 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.710
 I was saying though maybe some flaws is an extremely headline 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.530
 fast-paced fun to play 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.060
 and so I think it really deserves a little bit more only 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.840
 for this fact, because shooter mounts are frustrating nowadays 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.020
 specially 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.450
 cobra here we say 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.140
 and therefore either a title so truly funny I would never be 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.529
 waited if I'm honest 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.069
 however, for those who do not know this video game was done by the responder 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.989
 enterteiment and practically those who are the ones of the inter-tevez answers are 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.679
 part of the infinite word 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.809
 that part which had abandoned the service after the lawsuit which 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.380
 they had a dream then 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.720
 the lions 2 most important promoters of the infinite words namely jesus and fb 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.679
 Zampella 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.639
 bathroom furnishing final word and because and let's say infinite world 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.989
 activision and then they created this on the other half many rentals 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.639
 kessler go with them 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.680
 and to you too this title 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.720
 comet and as pabisch of this video we have the electronic zevi remember that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.680
 exclusive slippers for xbox founder pc the beta i'm playing it j because 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.819
 I do not own xbox here nor ever 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.169
 and then at least there is a liked game as it is structured 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.739
 in the beta only three classes 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.569
 idea practically beyond these three classes there will be 3 more titanic and you 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.950
 you can select them for yourself to select customize 15 at 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.369
 classes with the soldier 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.319
 which is the one with the titan are customizable 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.819
 then if they don't say if I don't make mistakes the soldier is customizable 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.819
 start from level 5 min tdt nano game from level 10 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.999
 it's practically the soldier's class is structured that you have a weapon 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.150
 primary with or 2 accessories 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.860
 you have the titan weapon in front of you pretty useful than you saw that anyway 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.759
 on this video game in tv italy empoli called an ipod 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.779
 minutes but every time it deals damage you kill the dead enemies and then 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.789
 is the time when you wish you could call the titan amber diminishing 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:48.299
 the then you have a secondary secondary weapon weapon in short before tactical pizza 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:53.939
 mm in short the one I recommend ersu with you surely of invisibility cap. 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.870
 the Serbs really need a lot when you have a Titan 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.970
 you want me to show 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.140
 used invisibility and then iphone and then shoot them with your beautiful lance 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.140
 we are very upset lovers of tarquini parade 9 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:06.980
 let's say that 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.690
 among the titans they are strong but fragile because as the game is not run 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.580
 game did not see it forbidding will suffice 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.370
 hide behind a building 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.449
 atheists practically you can quietly radicals without making you 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.370
 see acco 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.639
 invisible quite useless with the other playhouses because it will be enough 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.059
 easy to see that he is using it 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:29.599
 however for a titan it is not easy because if it is gigantic then it goes around 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.669
 for the map with these it is very difficult to see small enemies 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:33.520
 never mind 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.840
 those who are making windows here 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.970
 then just from this bed a grenade and then 2 because we say 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.569
 and therefore nothing the class structure in this manner 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.250
 that of the titan more - and similar how to enable etc. even if not now 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:49.889
 I remember precisely 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.120
 and in any case even the features are not always these you can choose 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.230
 specific skills weapons crap in different attacks such as that 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.759
 missile there are the 1 free btp 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.270
 another with hooking 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.379
 and then you also have the shield a place where you also saw apocalyptic 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:06.809
 hoopoe 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:10.240
 here is what language the comments use 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.330
 it is practically that system more or less this the weapons are beautiful to use 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.340
 there are also guns before ready forwards new targets automatically 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.789
 when he is near them 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.660
 Fast-paced game temperament and other thing to specify is a game that 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.240
 they practically have 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.160
 result here are six against but not to make the maps too dispersive have 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.360
 added bots 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.650
 de botte that sincerely new that artificial intelligence san deficienti 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.700
 they are artificial deficiency in that they are rather stupid indeed we remove 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:40.660
 the pretty 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.860
 then second lightly gather a moment to increase the difficulty we say 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.420
 yes of intelligence excuse yourself from barrel in such a way as to make it even more so 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.870
 more 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.110
 tube here all compelling here 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.470
 csa do this, however, the button is enough deficient because there are if 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.349
 maybe one is not as good as on the computer when you find yourself a bot 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.240
 deficient then you feel god because you make the seasons 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.650
 empoli boys was practically now in this game I'm not showing 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.409
 a simple betmatch let's say 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.479
 eneco in the case of gio also show hard points or dominions there 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.180
 of the other crowded real last eight breath 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.289
 hello no sorry the Italian press I don't remember what it's called maybe me 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.690
 seems so wrist info for a blunder i dont know i don't remember myself 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.809
 sorry 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.809
 he is practically boys and at the end of the game 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.819
 it's not that when you want to win you define the game because you are almost friends 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.839
 in short, not the losers 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:32.809
 therefore 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.589
 they will have to escape with a spaceship with a spaceship your task will be 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:40.499
 that to saint vincent and clearly to destroy it before they succeed to 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:41.470
 escape here 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.979
 in this game we did it in others not 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.150
 it's a nice thing I don't know so much I don't understand 100 practically so well 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.629
 but when you try to escape the last high you out your enemies 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:53.649
 they already have the victory we say 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:57.479
 for that it follows you have already won the enemies practically 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.610
 if they are killed it is no longer spawn because they have nothing new they are not 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.669
 so to fish make a spaceship 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.349
 here is a girl I hope this could have been useful is a game 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.020
 that is telling me so much 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.879
 &amp; gt but maybe you tried it too, what you think it was 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.419
 only waiting for you then and in the next one maybe I'll do 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.479
 blog detail of my impressions because there was not really the 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.259
 time that people do not tudo firox hi guys
