00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.370 

now<00:00:34.770> also<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> stroke<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.290> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
have here a black stroke to this object

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
have here a black stroke to this object
I<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.559> hold<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> shift<00:00:41.430> key<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.879> set

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I can hold down the shift key and set

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.060 
I can hold down the shift key and set
the<00:00:42.660> color<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.290> stroke<00:00:48.770> another<00:00:49.770> thing

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the color for the stroke another thing

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
the color for the stroke another thing
you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.850> hold<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> Alt<00:00:51.690> key<00:00:51.870> to

you can do is hold down the Alt key to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.420 
you can do is hold down the Alt key to
get<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> inverse<00:00:53.219> color<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.739> example<00:00:56.160> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
get the inverse color so for example for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.049 
get the inverse color so for example for
black<00:00:56.699> that's<00:00:57.600> white<00:00:58.489> for<00:00:59.489> white<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.969> black

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
black that's white for white it's black

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.460 
black that's white for white it's black
for<00:01:00.649> green<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:02.010> magenta<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:03.420> red<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.960> cyan

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
for green it's magenta for red is cyan

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.440 
for green it's magenta for red is cyan
and<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.339> on

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.230

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
drag to average color in an area for

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.100 
drag to average color in an area for
example<00:01:18.520> if<00:01:18.880> we<00:01:19.000> click<00:01:19.149> in<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.390> middle<00:01:19.630> here

example if we click in the middle here

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.030 
example if we click in the middle here
and<00:01:20.290> drag<00:01:20.740> I'll<00:01:21.189> get<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.759> gray<00:01:22.090> color<00:01:23.040> between

and drag I'll get a gray color between

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.289 
and drag I'll get a gray color between
black<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.060> white<00:01:25.210> we're<00:01:25.810> getting<00:01:26.200> gray<00:01:26.500> color

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
black and white we're getting gray color

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.359 
black and white we're getting gray color
between<00:01:28.299> green<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:28.930> red<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.979> are<00:01:30.070> getting
