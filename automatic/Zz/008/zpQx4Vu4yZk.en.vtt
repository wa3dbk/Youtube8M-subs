00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
thoughts on this guy this has been on my

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
thoughts on this guy this has been on my
pedal<00:00:17.130> board<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:18.150> put<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.510> there

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
pedal board and I first put it on there

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320 
pedal board and I first put it on there
I<00:00:18.900> thought<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.859> know<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.310> may<00:00:20.609> break<00:00:20.880> after

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
I thought you know this may break after

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.310 
I thought you know this may break after
a<00:00:21.359> little<00:00:21.570> while<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:21.990> gonna<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
a little while and I'm gonna have to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.310 
a little while and I'm gonna have to
replace<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.039> boss<00:00:23.279> EQ<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.019> which<00:00:25.019> boss

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
replace it with a boss EQ and which boss

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.279 
replace it with a boss EQ and which boss
makes<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> great<00:00:25.830> EQ<00:00:26.160> also<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:28.109> hasn't

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
makes a great EQ also but this hasn't

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
makes a great EQ also but this hasn't
broken<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.250> been<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:29.849> good<00:00:30.000> pedal

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
broken and it's been a pretty good pedal

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900 
broken and it's been a pretty good pedal
for<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.289> EQ<00:00:31.859> works<00:00:32.070> great<00:00:32.430> there's<00:00:32.759> no

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
for me the EQ works great there's no

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610 
for me the EQ works great there's no
noise<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> decent<00:00:34.440> job

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
noise in it really they do a decent job

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.580 
noise in it really they do a decent job
with<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.090> downsides<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.079> basically

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
with that downsides are it is basically

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.110 
with that downsides are it is basically
you<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> little<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.700> cheaper<00:00:38.879> or

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you know it's a little bit cheaper or

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.709 
you know it's a little bit cheaper or

plastic<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.020> metal<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
plastic it's not metal so it is going to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060 
plastic it's not metal so it is going to
break<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> don't<00:00:45.539> take<00:00:45.960> care<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.500> but

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
far right it has this level basically

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
like a volume switch and so a lot of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
like a volume switch and so a lot of
guys<00:01:38.460> won't<00:01:38.880> even<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.329> their<00:01:39.479> EQ<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.079> and

guys won't even have their EQ on and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
guys won't even have their EQ on and
then<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.700> sudden<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.119> ready<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
then all of a sudden they are ready to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.929 
then all of a sudden they are ready to
solo<00:01:43.020> they'll<00:01:43.680> click<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.790> they'll

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
solo they'll click this on and they'll

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
solo they'll click this on and they'll
get<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> level<00:01:45.659> boost<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.530> because

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
get like a level boost you know because

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.139 
get like a level boost you know because
you're<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.670> louder<00:01:47.909> when

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you're you be a little bit louder when

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
you're you be a little bit louder when
you're<00:01:48.270> soloing<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> give<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you're soloing so it's going to give you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.069 
you're soloing so it's going to give you
that<00:01:49.770> boost<00:01:50.009> over<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:51.000> normal<00:01:51.420> signal<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that boost over your normal signal and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.139 
that boost over your normal signal and
so<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.590> another<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.040> people<00:01:53.610> use<00:01:53.880> an

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so that's another way that people use an

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
so that's another way that people use an
EQ<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.200> anyway<00:01:55.680> hopefully<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.219> helpful

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
EQ but anyway hopefully that's helpful

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.219 
EQ but anyway hopefully that's helpful
