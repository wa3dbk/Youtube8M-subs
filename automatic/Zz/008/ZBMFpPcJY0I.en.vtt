position<00:00:56.600> within<00:00:56.780> a<00:00:56.930> range<00:00:57.190> what's<00:00:58.190> different

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
position within a range what's different

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.800 
position within a range what's different
about<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.210> Hellfire<00:00:59.690> is<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:02.120> actually<00:01:02.570> I

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
about the Hellfire is that it actually I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.710 
about the Hellfire is that it actually I
believe<00:01:03.500> replaces<00:01:04.509> probably<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.570> most

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
believe replaces probably the most

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.840 
believe replaces probably the most
important<00:01:06.290> board<00:01:06.650> in<00:01:06.890> all<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.310> our<00:01:07.430> Quivers

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
important board in all of our Quivers

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.560 
important board in all of our Quivers
and<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:08.720> our<00:01:08.990> standard<00:01:09.260> short<00:01:09.590> board<00:01:10.570> bit

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and that is our standard short board bit

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.180 
and that is our standard short board bit
of<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.720> bold<00:01:13.150> statement<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.510> suppose<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.190> the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
of a bold statement I suppose and the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.969 
of a bold statement I suppose and the
jury<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.550> still<00:01:16.640> out<00:01:16.840> but<00:01:17.840> what<00:01:18.590> I'm<00:01:18.710> getting

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
jury is still out but what I'm getting

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.310 
jury is still out but what I'm getting
to<00:01:19.010> is<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:22.100> Hellfire<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.909> not<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.270> hybrid<00:01:23.570> it's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
to is the Hellfire is not a hybrid it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.260 
to is the Hellfire is not a hybrid it's
not<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.530> high-performance<00:01:25.159> hybrid<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.729> it's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
not a high-performance hybrid and it's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.690 
not a high-performance hybrid and it's
not<00:01:26.450> your<00:01:26.600> current<00:01:26.930> short<00:01:27.170> board<00:01:27.409> it's<00:01:28.310> it's

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
not your current short board it's it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.750 
not your current short board it's it's
somewhere<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.270> middle<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.860> what<00:01:31.729> I

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
somewhere in the middle and so what I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.539 
somewhere in the middle and so what I
did<00:01:31.880> was<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.240> morphed<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.440> Spitfire<00:01:33.979> out<00:01:34.250> to

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
did was I morphed the Spitfire out to

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.820 
did was I morphed the Spitfire out to
each's<00:01:34.909> know<00:01:35.299> isn't<00:01:35.510> it<00:01:35.690> so<00:01:35.870> so<00:01:36.380> instead<00:01:36.650> of

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
each's know isn't it so so instead of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.490 
each's know isn't it so so instead of
being<00:01:37.010> 5/8<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.760> becomes<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.150> 510<00:01:38.690> but<00:01:39.440> I

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
being 5/8 it becomes a 510 but I

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.890 
being 5/8 it becomes a 510 but I
maintain<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.220> volume<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.360> it's<00:01:41.540> got<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.720> same

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
maintain the volume so it's got the same

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.590 
maintain the volume so it's got the same
paddling<00:01:42.350> volume<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.790> nose<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.060> narrower

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
paddling volume but the nose is narrower

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.140 
paddling volume but the nose is narrower
the<00:01:44.960> tails<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.440> arawa<00:01:45.740> it's<00:01:46.610> also<00:01:46.820> got<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
the tails and arawa it's also got the

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.990 
the tails and arawa it's also got the
same<00:01:47.180> thickness<00:01:47.900> distribution<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.790> same

same thickness distribution the same

same thickness distribution the same
thickness<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.570> tail<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.920> same

thickness of the tail and the same

thickness of the tail and the same
thickness<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.580> note<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.140> when<00:01:54.140> you're

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
thickness in the note so when you're

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.289 
thickness in the note so when you're
paddling<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.770> when<00:01:55.190> you're<00:01:55.460> surfing<00:01:56.000> it

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
paddling it when you're surfing it

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.700 
paddling it when you're surfing it
doesn't<00:01:57.200> feel<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:58.190> doesn't<00:01:58.520> feel<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:58.729> a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
doesn't feel it doesn't feel like a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.620 
doesn't feel it doesn't feel like a
shortboard<00:02:00.520> like<00:02:00.730> doesn't<00:02:01.030> feel<00:02:01.150> like<00:02:01.210> my<00:02:01.420> six

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
shortboard like doesn't feel like my six

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.740 
shortboard like doesn't feel like my six
-<00:02:01.840> because<00:02:02.230> my<00:02:02.350> six<00:02:02.560> dudes<00:02:02.710> more<00:02:02.920> foil<00:02:03.750> but

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
- because my six dudes more foil but

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.350 
- because my six dudes more foil but
it's<00:02:05.110> narrow<00:02:05.680> enough<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.910> make<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> difference

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
it's narrow enough to make a difference

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.820 
it's narrow enough to make a difference
that<00:02:07.780> when<00:02:07.930> you're<00:02:08.080> doing<00:02:08.229> your<00:02:08.440> turns

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
that when you're doing your turns

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.590 
that when you're doing your turns
everything<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.520> just<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.240> little<00:02:10.390> bit

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
everything is just that little bit

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.810 
everything is just that little bit
shorter<00:02:10.990> through<00:02:11.170> your<00:02:11.320> turn<00:02:11.490> but<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:12.520> still

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
shorter through your turn but I still

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.030 
shorter through your turn but I still
get<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.240> two<00:02:13.780> ways<00:02:13.930> as<00:02:14.230> easily<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.860> would

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
get it in two ways as easily as I would

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.060 
get it in two ways as easily as I would
on<00:02:15.220> my<00:02:15.430> six<00:02:15.640> -<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:17.320> was<00:02:17.470> like<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.860> light

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
on my six - so it was like the light

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.470 
on my six - so it was like the light
went<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.580> me<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.940> I've<00:02:19.000> been<00:02:19.030> surfing<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
went on for me and I've been surfing a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.370 
went on for me and I've been surfing a
long<00:02:19.630> time<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.950> said<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.280> me<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.200> can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
long time and it said to me if I can

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.410 
long time and it said to me if I can
write<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> shorter<00:02:23.890> board<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.400> still<00:02:25.090> get<00:02:25.270> into

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
write a shorter board and still get into

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.910 
write a shorter board and still get into
ways<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:25.930> well<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.320> my<00:02:26.590> six<00:02:26.830> -<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:29.620> turns

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
ways as well as my six - then my turns

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.010 
ways as well as my six - then my turns
are<00:02:30.070> going<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.250> be<00:02:30.310> linked<00:02:30.670> better<00:02:30.940> when<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
are going to be linked better when I

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.540 
are going to be linked better when I
push<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> turn<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:32.830> going<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.010> come<00:02:33.220> through

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
push a turn it's going to come through

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.670 
push a turn it's going to come through
that<00:02:33.670> turn<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.090> loop<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.690> come<00:02:35.350> out<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
that turn and loop and come out of the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.199 
that turn and loop and come out of the
turn<00:02:35.830> quick<00:02:36.100> instead<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.520> doing<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:36.970> two

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
turn quick instead of doing a one two

turn quick instead of doing a one two
three<00:02:37.239> stage<00:02:37.810> tune<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.820> that's<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
three stage tune and and that's that is

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.990 
three stage tune and and that's that is
that<00:02:41.170> was<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.440> plan<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.610> precisely

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
