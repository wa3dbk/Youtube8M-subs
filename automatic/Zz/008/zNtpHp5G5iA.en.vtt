 but what matters is what comes in 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.710

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.080

 also to give vi that made him take this 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.740
 It's work, too. 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.869
 some votes and for was essentially 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.789
 one of the people who motivated me to do 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.130
 this contest by voice and both very 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.350
 for mothers mainly for the coming day 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.840
 percent the big winner and now 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.229
 Let's have a very, very long time. 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.450
 much is mico in the vote for the better and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.420
 entered the game place the competitors 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 were steam and fat wai were two projects 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.979
 completely different but we will upload 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.050
 We use very very good ones and I will have 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.450
 sorry to leave a god for the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.209
 way but the great winner of the vote 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.630
 to better get someone in there this is not 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.630
 go 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:33.760
 is not here and now comes a time in 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.070
 that you are going to say hamad but this is not 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 it makes no sense I was right now 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.570
 facebook poll and viper effekt 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.520
 was ahead with another 100 votes 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.840
 is going on here I'll Halley 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.840
 explain yourself calmly 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.020
 there is a very simple reason is that it is 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.750
 the belt and the avaÃ­ was during great 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.640
 part of the week ahead of the vote and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.860
 the moment the steam and fec 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.170
 have moved ahead of the vote with 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.709
 more than 100 votes 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.450
 it was an abysmal difference and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.769
 so I went to search a little more to 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.720
 see what actually happened 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.600
 during this period so that they 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.070
 therefore move ahead if you vote 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.530
 first in the comments area of my 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.480
 videos from my video of the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.459
 missions 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.860
 I found it strange that there were 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.620
 so many comments to say only to 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.239
 option because because it had 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.420
 clearly for people to vote 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.110
 two categories ie the game place 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.780
 Slovak and there were a lot of people just saying aaa 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.970
 and the explanation being none and the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.910
 people who returned b or essentially 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.549
 b gives an explanation they said this one entered 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.680
 has more to do with the channel is not 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.870
 still the weather is more related has 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.670
 an animation is different from the ordinary one 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.260
 a certain way is true 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.610
 studies as they were there did not 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.700
 explanations for such 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.610
 and then it was at that moment that I went 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.360
 to the steam and fat channel and saw them 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.780
 were to run a contest for this 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.709
 vote or be the case and win and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.350
 of this vote would offer the cop 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.290
 line to its subscribers because it is not 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.419
 wrong I think this much in pumping is 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.669
 a very good initiative for you 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.470
 can earn more subscribers more 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.750
 more views of knowledge I 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.260
 I understand the series I understand but it is 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.220
 unfair is unfair to others 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.009
 competitors 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.740
 is a formula 1 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.990
 Is it not correct, could you 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.569
 do this after winning the contest 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.229
 cintrÃ³n you entered had the potential and 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.080
 has potential is very good and do this 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.449
 It's unfair to stop there I may not want to 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.240
 be set up may even come to offer 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.369
 but after the vote because so 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.499
 there is always someone who will have 

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:54.389
 advantage over the other exists 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:56.939
 a lot of people that you might even prefer 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.460
 entered the goal but will vote several 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:02.819
 reflexes, for example, the fact that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.490
 To be able to win a game that I want to reach 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.020
 this is competition that is disloyal in this 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.300
 High I understand our 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.099
 motivations but it's great and because of this 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.499
 Reason to enter will have to be 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.189
 disqualified from this contest and entered 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:18.539
 eight times in this category of the best 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.999
 You came in from Lindia 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.459
 however and as I do not like to be 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.979
 unfair to anyone, not only will I 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:28.559
 used steam and fex in 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.409
 clean some of the lines either within or 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.749
 the goal and continue to be the main but 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.419
 there will be some series without being able to use 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.580
 among others, perfect counting to enter 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.620
 and I like to get a new game 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.439
 may not be borderlands but another 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.110
 game that you can offer them in your 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:47.789
 channel in the contest and made them a 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.039
 excellent work and so has all the 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.279
 I like to promote not only the work of 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:56.039
 god with dog with we go with the day 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:59.759
 come all deserve subscribers on the channels 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.039
 are all in personal description 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.969
 in particular all inputs were 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.999
 very good 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.580
 only two could win there was also 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.319
 this competition issue was both 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.959
 vapors that I think were not 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.089
 just for aek but so everyone goes out to 

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.399
 to win everyone did is at work in 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:19.649
 they all deserve recognition of the 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.749
 gay community just do not forget to leave the 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:24.269
 Your taste and your favorite 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.259
 what they think of this situation and even 

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.649
 the next 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.649
 went
