 in prison use the video of your goals 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.869
 on my good channel today we will talk about 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.299
 the ball the galley or the linen that that 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.469
 futsal glitter one pint player 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.649
 area on the ball 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.670
 besides we will see the rails have taken 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.670
 good luck 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.009
 enough of inflation, let's go to the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.740
 what matters 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.780
 The first book we will see is the ball. 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.869
 It's quite simple, just you. 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.689
 hold your analog right to a 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.509
 sides and as soon as the player starts 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.849
 to make the move you loose analog 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.530
 if you hold analog and do not drop 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.209
 Look at the movement he makes and does 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.000
 multiple goals 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.780
 good guys or it's a crime can be 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.150
 stopped or a move when you 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.720
 is moving and made the goal and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.360
 hold your analog is one side 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.879
 the player makes this variation also worth 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.739
 say that as a dribble move is 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.140
 relative to the position of the player you have 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.700
 to go by running your analogue right 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.340
 little by little to make this move 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.250
 that I showed you can make purchase 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.430
 erased an inverted pedal and you 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.069
 will make this move there is not explained 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.500
 in the game help even if you guys 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.209
 watch the highlights of fifa 12 I already 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.209
 until you score a goal using that tribe 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.100
 this is the drawback a pull for 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.850
 behind to do it is easy just give you 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.180
 a click 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.990
 a tock on your left analogue 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.110
 You can make exits with this dribble. 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.120
 diagonally back to the sides 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.910
 Look, it's good for you to clear the bid. 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 dribble and it is quite simple to do enough 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.680
 you dribble and use your own 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.640
 left to exit 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.540
 that you wish to see you can leave at 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.810
 speed with it our next tribe 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.710
 not in the rest of the game or s to do 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.890
 it 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.380
 You have to hold the rs with side of the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.110
 fliq a touch on ls 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.660
 on the other side basically you make a 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.390
 good or one side then analogical topic 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.860
 that on the other hand this trail of five 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.860
 galley stars 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.600
 the good or done consists in making a goal 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.850
 and give a little bit on the opposite side a 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.260
 right analog signal as it is 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.380
 there on your little screen 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.870
 This dribble is also five stars. 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.410
 a dribble that leaves your game well 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.410
 pretty 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.329
 our next it is four 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 stars are called ball that the mall is 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.700
 good and can be so because it is another 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.120
 dribble that does not appear in fifa help 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.870
 13 to make it easy you give a goal and 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.830
 give a touch back on the rs 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.200
 You can do is always running too. 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.160
 this is a very nice group and let your 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.950
 very confused opponent near wall 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.210
 with the Gabonese shop this rail is 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.919
 five stars to do it enough you 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.460
 gives a bowl and gives an unusual touch 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.290
 right analog stick forward instead of 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.620
 date brings us how we made a good river 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.620
 top 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.340
 now let's look at some examples of 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.340
 applications and the dribbles 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.930
 there I passing ibrahimovic from the goalkeeper one 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.229
 simple goal or now a good river game 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.650
 shopping run for sensational job 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.650
 andreas beck 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.750
 there looks fucking or the robot in 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.710
 shopping is the letter cut 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.500
 look one more 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.590
 these books are very good folks 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.220
 Practice in the arena because it's worth it. 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.220
 learn 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.400
 you can see in other videos of mine 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.440
 fifa highlights 12 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.120
 several goals I made using 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.539
 dribbles 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:58.350
 there you can have ideas and situations 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:58.350
 where you can use the dribbles 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.710
 then will come the game and more 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.300
 examples of the rails we learned today 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:18.890
 the ball with baby 2 paul one more look 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:24.230
 quickness you spend built 360 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.230
 lavezzi to the ball or shock cart 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:38.790
 another there with the catch in Persian 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:41.040
 And I do not even know how to protect myself. 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.050
 Very fast personal dribble is very easy 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.440
 command is virtually obligatory 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:58.440
 play fifa and break blah to learn 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:07:00.780
 Look at the abese bending the defense is 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.890
 moved to good oil or fake twice the 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.880
 output 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.380
 that annoys people very adversely 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.320
 when you're angry 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:14.240
 you lose concentration it's critical 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.240
 for you to play well fifa 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.099

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.039
 our crime 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:30.919
 To close people, go, my dear. 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:33.199
 celebrating there lycra gull 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:35.629
 let's see the globe lavezzi on the tip 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.449
 left already got rid of the score cut 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:40.909
 a new marker that cute dribble 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:42.349
 toss another good one or touched the middle 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:45.740
 nor the short light 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:47.289
 Look at the goal, our goal. 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.969
 This is it people, I'm going to stay here. 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:53.589
 I hope you guys in the next video tutorial 

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.589
 A hug for everyone
