when<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.269> open<00:00:09.300> really<00:00:10.139> busted<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.769> sylvans<00:00:11.219> i

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
when you open really busted in sylvans i

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.589 
when you open really busted in sylvans i
was<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> put<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> deck<00:00:12.360> but

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
was going to put this with the deck but

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.360 
was going to put this with the deck but
then<00:00:12.719> i<00:00:12.780> decided<00:00:12.809> against<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.590> not<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.190> make

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
then i decided against it not to make

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
then i decided against it not to make
two<00:00:14.790> separate<00:00:15.089> videos<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.599> i<00:00:15.839> figure<00:00:16.320> i<00:00:16.350> have

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
two separate videos but i figure i have

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.910 
two separate videos but i figure i have
the<00:00:16.710> dual<00:00:16.859> video<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.690> I<00:00:18.690> film<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.770> deck

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the dual video and I film the deck

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.710 
the dual video and I film the deck
profile<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> didn't<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
profile first so I didn't take in the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.429 
profile first so I didn't take in the
occurs<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.470> editing<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.580> know<00:00:24.439> apart

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
occurs in of editing out you know apart

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
occurs in of editing out you know apart
and<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.859> didn't<00:00:26.070> feel<00:00:26.220> right<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> deck<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and it didn't feel right for the deck I

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.390 
and it didn't feel right for the deck I
feel<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.720> better<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.050> why<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.130> go<00:00:29.250> into

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
feel it was better for why we go into

another<00:00:50.190> copy<00:00:50.579> plant<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.180> probably<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:53.070> have

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
another copy plant I probably would have

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.389 
another copy plant I probably would have
just<00:00:53.250> used<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.410> when<00:00:55.410> even<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:56.160> nuts

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
just used that and when even more nuts

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.979 
just used that and when even more nuts
but<00:00:56.699> there's<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.059> too<00:00:57.270> much<00:00:57.390> further<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.780> could

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
but there's not too much further I could

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.040 
but there's not too much further I could
taken<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.620> least<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:58.920> opinion<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> uh

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
taken it at least of my opinion but uh

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
taken it at least of my opinion but uh
if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.250> someone's<00:01:02.969> could<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
if you see if someone's could do this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
constantly then they'd be uber broken

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.289 
constantly then they'd be uber broken
and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.950> dice<00:01:08.189> roll<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:09.180> let

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
attack I think I could have done it but

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.369 
attack I think I could have done it but
it<00:05:30.539> would<00:05:30.629> have<00:05:30.689> been<00:05:30.779> a<00:05:30.839> hell<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.139> a<00:05:31.199> lot<00:05:31.319> more

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
it would have been a hell of a lot more

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.769 
it would have been a hell of a lot more
riskier<00:05:32.069> I<00:05:32.250> probably<00:05:33.150> would<00:05:33.449> have<00:05:33.509> just<00:05:33.599> been

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
riskier I probably would have just been

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.559 
riskier I probably would have just been
on<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:34.020> thousand<00:05:34.500> had<00:05:35.069> if<00:05:35.219> I<00:05:35.370> not<00:05:35.729> played<00:05:36.180> and
