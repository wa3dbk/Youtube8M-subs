00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.710
 a few months ago a report published 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.450
 by the superintendence of services 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.339
 health services yielded the high level of 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.410
 arsenic that contained drinking water in 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.570
 some communes of santiago being the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.760
 most affected the big valley condominium 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.800
 of the underworld however the report left 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.779
 glimpse further that the drinking water of 9 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.660
 The country's communes contain high levels 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.070
 of toxicity that would be making you sick 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.070
 a day to the Chilean population 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.340
 it may be tomorrow eros we wanted to find out 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.530
 how toxic the drinking water could be 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.840
 of the capital that we take and in which 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.700
 we bathe daily and how this 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.239
 can affect our health put 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.239
 Attention 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 the latest report published by the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.610
 superintendence of health services 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.649
 with date January 2013 threw that are two 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.540
 the communes of santiago that exceed the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 Arsenic limit in drinking water 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.879
 these are big valley 1 and 2 technical and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 great valley of the underworld while I go 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.199
 hidden from the arrayÃ¡n what barnechea bread 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.759
 of sugar and the poplars have not hill 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 informed about the amount of arsenic 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.590
 that would contain the water something worrying 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 due to the evil that would cause the excess 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.180
 of the component in the human body and in 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.550
 the long term increase the possibility of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.460
 develop lung cancer of the bladder 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.479
 of the kidneys via urinary liver and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 skin in the shortest term increase the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.729
 mortality due to myocardial infarction and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.660
 for cerebrovascular problems 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.960
 also produces peripheral polyneuritis and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.550
 gastrointestinal problems related to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 this is what the authorities have called 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.720
 the calm because in any case 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.729
 the excessive amounts would not reach 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 cause these evils however the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 specialist in the subject makes a call 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.970
 to ignore this and here for something 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.980
 should not be exceeded 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.200
 in these amounts although companies 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.660
 can request an extension for the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.760
 next of irresponsible and lack of 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.490
 ethics because the norm is for 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.500
 fulfill them 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.450
 not calm with these reports 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.399
 We also found out that there are many 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.380
 communes suffering from excess chlorine 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.690
 like all those that work with 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.730
 health services of the station as well 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.540
 as also many have not reported 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.819
 the amount of fluorine we contacted with 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.890
 the argentine company psa pioneer in 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.900
 water filters and aunt has two years in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.580
 Chile so that they could explain why 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.890
 of this innovative product in our 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.530
 country and past in some tests with 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 potable water of santiago put the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640
 pollution awareness was doing 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.989
 that this technology that already worked in 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.299
 gas factory soda factory 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.069
 purifying water was a custom 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.010
 began to generate small technology that 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.110
 could make use of a home today 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.299
 is using Chile at home 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.069
 also through different fairs that 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.870
 We have been in the area of the coast 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.000
 public was not asking and with the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.650
 magnitude of the final orders of the year 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.569
 2010 was established to a company name 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.150
 Here , what we are seeing is the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.459
 the passage of time in the pre-filter 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.560
 Pure white white is transforming 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.890
 how long 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.140
 and arts in 90 days always depending 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.520
 of the commune and depending on the use we 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.069
 we found in the commune of Providence 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.930
 and with potable water of the place we wanted 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.709
 see the chlorine that it contained with our 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.349
 own eyes these were the results 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.120
 Our purifier consists of two parts 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.760
 purifier and glass poured with certain 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.099
 in the pouring glass we are going to throw water 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.099
 of key grown we extracted 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.470
 the purifier does its job of 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.280
 decontaminate 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.850
 here we have another glass 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.850
 and let's go 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.660
 to place a reagent called ortho 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.230
 line 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.260
 two 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.690
 / j in another reagent or tutoring and we will 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.019
 verify the presence of free chlorine in 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.019
 Water 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.250
 this is not indicating that the return 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.410
 perfectly drinkable we also perform 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.330
 in the counter test and we mix water from 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.240
 the key with purified water the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.600
 result was the same the chlorine appeared 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.450
 again the water that is purified 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.820
 same that does not react with the reagent 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.549
 thousands billions that perhaps of 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.830
 people buy water based to drink 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.720
 mainly the purified water is used 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.270
 for the whole place to drink for 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.680
 cooking also when this water that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.630
 it's purified we mix it with something 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.630
 key you will see that quickly 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.220
 we observed that what we were looking for was 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.670
 pure water we do not have it and that's what happens 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.540
 when we cook with water 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.370
 with water that's why the purifier has 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.290
 a provision of 30 liters per day 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.730
 It should be remembered that large quantities of 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.950
 chlorine in the body can cause 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.020
 different types of cancer but no more 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.880
 potent than arsenic as well as the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.320
 Fluorine can potentiate problems of 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.320
 osteoporosis in adults 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.530
 in the middle of the summary that was filed 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.630
 against the company not waters the seremi of 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.520
 health pink oyarce visited yesterday by the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.949
 tomorrow the commune of lampa to realize 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.990
 arsenic measurements results that 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.699
 will be ready the third week of 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.650
 April not only what we are looking for 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.599
 with this is to prevent the consumption 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.819
 prolonged of a water that could not 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.800
 comply with the norm water for today day 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.259
 we have made the demands 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.569
 respective to the company so that in the 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.690
 during the year proceed with a water 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.979
 that has 0.01 milligrams much earlier what 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.919
 that it sets the standard that was 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.479
 approved in 2006 protests and 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.370
 calls for attention from the 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.020
 neighbors of the underworld today lifted the 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.720
 alert about what we are taking and 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.970
 cooking the water daily 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.099
 is not as pure as they tell us and today 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.960
 controversy arises to clarify that 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.960
 we are losing the Chileans
