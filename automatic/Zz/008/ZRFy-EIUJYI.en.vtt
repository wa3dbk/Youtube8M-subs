00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.960 
others vilified and I think it it was a
pretty<00:00:48.739> interesting<00:00:48.920> set<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.309> design<00:00:49.640> choices

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
pretty interesting set of design choices

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.170 
pretty interesting set of design choices
I<00:00:50.390> mean<00:00:50.900> um<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.739> know<00:00:51.860> naval<00:00:52.250> battles<00:00:52.610> okay

with<00:00:55.010> something<00:00:55.160> like<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.370> design-wise

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
with something like that design-wise

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.639 
with something like that design-wise
when<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:56.660> when<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.810> add<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.050> naval<00:00:57.410> battles

process a tickly each it's kind of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.670 
process a tickly each it's kind of
interesting<00:01:41.270> one<00:01:41.689> little<00:01:41.930> bit<00:01:42.049> is<00:01:42.170> like<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.650> is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
interesting one little bit is like it is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.100 
interesting one little bit is like it is
like<00:01:42.830> two<00:01:43.189> yachts<00:01:43.689> going<00:01:44.689> around<00:01:44.869> of<00:01:44.990> course

like two yachts going around of course

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.289 
like two yachts going around of course
there's<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.100> constant<00:01:46.520> jockeying<00:01:46.970> about

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
there's that constant jockeying about

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.690 
there's that constant jockeying about
you<00:01:48.080> know<00:01:48.170> when<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.380> say<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.560> same<00:01:49.010> race<00:01:49.310> yeah

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
you're joking around trying to get in

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.840 
you're joking around trying to get in
wind<00:01:51.140> position<00:01:51.500> because<00:01:51.710> that's<00:01:51.890> going<00:01:52.100> but

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
wind position because that's going but

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.710 
wind position because that's going but
at<00:01:52.909> least<00:01:53.000> they're<00:01:53.150> not<00:01:53.180> actually<00:01:53.390> shooting

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
we never intended and the way did it was

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.289 
we never intended and the way did it was
he<00:03:49.560> said<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> bunch<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.069> bishops<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.640> cause<00:03:51.150> the

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
he said a bunch of bishops in cause the

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.820 
he said a bunch of bishops in cause the
repeat<00:03:51.569> cause<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.989> peasant<00:03:52.290> rebellion<00:03:52.709> and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
repeat cause the peasant rebellion and

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.860 
repeat cause the peasant rebellion and
then<00:03:52.950> send<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.220> diplomat<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.209> bribe<00:03:54.599> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
then send a diplomat in and bribe the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.580 
then send a diplomat in and bribe the
rebels<00:03:56.540> I'd<00:03:57.540> lost<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.870> reason<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.260> was<00:03:58.290> still

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
rebels I'd lost the reason I was still

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.850 
rebels I'd lost the reason I was still
his<00:03:58.650> ally<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.099> couldn't<00:03:59.370> do<00:03:59.459> anything<00:03:59.670> about

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
his ally I couldn't do anything about

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.580 
his ally I couldn't do anything about
brilliant<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.959> pumping<00:04:03.959> work<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.440> game

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
brilliant and pumping work the game

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.069 
brilliant and pumping work the game
doesn't<00:04:04.769> even<00:04:05.010> something<00:04:05.750> unintended<00:04:06.750> but

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
doesn't even something unintended but

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.009 
doesn't even something unintended but
clever<00:04:07.560> emergent<00:04:08.489> behavior<00:04:08.610> yeah<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.810> first

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
clever emergent behavior yeah the first

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.150 
clever emergent behavior yeah the first
time<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.440> elephants<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:10.860> running

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.610 
time you see the elephants in running
that<00:04:11.519> was<00:04:11.640> yeah<00:04:12.420> as<00:04:12.720> what<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:12.989> always<00:04:13.260> described

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that was yeah as what I always described

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.949 
that was yeah as what I always described

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
first time sorting that was a place we

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.629 
first time sorting that was a place we
have<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> lot<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.200> good<00:04:49.530> taking<00:04:49.889> place<00:04:50.099> and<00:04:50.430> it'd

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
have a lot of good taking place and it'd

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.839

improve<00:05:38.039> then<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:38.729> becomes<00:05:39.060> easier<00:05:39.330> and

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
improve then it becomes easier and

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
you may release the tools I don't know I

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.029 
you may release the tools I don't know I
have<00:05:42.900> no<00:05:43.020> idea<00:05:43.229> what's<00:05:43.560> going<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.740> go<00:05:43.800> on<00:05:43.830> down

the<00:05:44.129> future<00:05:44.430> but<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.680> just<00:05:46.919> let<00:05:47.009> me<00:05:47.039> shake

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
the future but I so just let me shake

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.850 
the future but I so just let me shake
just<00:05:47.610> be<00:05:47.759> completely<00:05:47.940> really<00:05:48.539> freezing<00:05:48.860> and

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
just be completely really freezing and

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.219 
just be completely really freezing and
it<00:05:49.949> freezes<00:05:50.129> up<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.490> be<00:05:50.580> creative<00:05:50.970> in<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:52.110> way

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
that we want to on the project gives us

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.450 
that we want to on the project gives us
the<00:05:54.479> ability<00:05:54.569> to<00:05:55.050> just<00:05:55.800> create<00:05:56.009> stuff<00:05:56.250> or<00:05:56.370> not

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
the ability to just create stuff or not

the ability to just create stuff or not
without<00:05:57.240> interpretation<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.139> that<00:05:58.259> would<00:05:58.380> be

without interpretation and that would be
