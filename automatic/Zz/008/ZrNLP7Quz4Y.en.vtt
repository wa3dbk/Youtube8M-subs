 Wow, how cool 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.289
 but no one wants to buy it, I came to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 buy a property 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.320
 Let's take the album and some little cards. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.420

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.679
 what I recorded on the bench 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.810
 I'm sorry that the audio got a little 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.939
 Bad because while I was walking 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 I did not realize I put my finger on 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.709
 up my microphone here in the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.200
 album 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.640
 I'm going to do a quick review here because 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.269
 I think everybody already knows this 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.459
 album 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:26.239

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.950

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.560

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.430

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.150
 I'm not going to make a very detailed book. 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.120

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.960
 inside is the poster that I wanted another 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.560

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:15.150
 and here is the 2014 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.760

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.870

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.860
 I already saw that I watched the video. 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.300
 of Julia that Julia whistles and tv 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.370
 monster also showed that they had 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.720
 the album and gave me a lot of 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.440
 buying 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.700
 so let's get down to business here we 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:41.370
 open and see if you see a picture of you 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.180
 here it looks cool that the figurine is that 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.920
 actually it's not just a character 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.960

00:04:49.920 --> 00:05:01.710

 plus a franchise share and hold a 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.150

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:41.520
 hold a little to where the drug 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:49.500
 because the last package that is the 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:52.530

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.380
 Monsters wishes I think it's with 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.380
