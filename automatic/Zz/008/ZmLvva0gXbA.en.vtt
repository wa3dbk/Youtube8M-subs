situation right here they would have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.140 
situation right here they would have
reggie<00:02:35.990> wayne<00:02:36.260> run<00:02:36.980> in<00:02:37.160> place<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:38.270> slow<00:02:38.510> down

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
reggie wayne run in place to slow down

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.440 
reggie wayne run in place to slow down
he<00:02:41.150> doesn't<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.950> then<00:02:43.850> he<00:02:44.150> drags<00:02:44.450> his

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
he doesn't do that and then he drags his

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.199 
he doesn't do that and then he drags his
feet<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:47.390> make<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.600> touchdown<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.180> a

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
feet to make the touchdown this is a

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.200 
feet to make the touchdown this is a
great<00:02:50.510> animation<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.350> his<00:02:51.590> name

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.390 

you<00:02:55.750> can<00:02:55.960> see

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.640 

so<00:02:58.970> imagine<00:02:59.269> he<00:02:59.750> would<00:02:59.840> either<00:02:59.989> run<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.409> place

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
so imagine he would either run in place

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.670 
so imagine he would either run in place
or<00:03:01.159> he<00:03:01.730> would<00:03:01.970> take<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.110> step<00:03:03.170> right<00:03:03.470> here

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
or he would take this step right here

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.710 
or he would take this step right here
and<00:03:04.189> then<00:03:04.400> his<00:03:04.579> left<00:03:04.849> foot<00:03:05.060> would<00:03:05.390> be<00:03:05.569> out<00:03:05.689> of

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
and then his left foot would be out of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.979 
and then his left foot would be out of
outs<00:03:06.079> he<00:03:06.290> would<00:03:06.500> continue<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.250> run<00:03:07.989> unaware

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
outs he would continue to run unaware

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.250 
outs he would continue to run unaware
that<00:03:09.049> he<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.709> near<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:11.000> outer<00:03:11.480> bounds<00:03:11.840> markers

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
that he is near the outer bounds markers

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.319 
that he is near the outer bounds markers
so<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.709> few<00:03:13.159> improvements<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.439> pretty<00:03:16.069> late

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
so a few improvements it is pretty late

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.319 
so a few improvements it is pretty late
tomorrow<00:03:17.329> to<00:03:17.629> release<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.140> settings<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:19.329> i

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
tomorrow to release the settings that i

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.979 
tomorrow to release the settings that i
play<00:03:20.659> on<00:03:21.079> that<00:03:21.950> i<00:03:22.010> use<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.609> this<00:03:22.760> demo<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.750> a

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
play on that i use in this demo but a

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.399 
play on that i use in this demo but a
few<00:03:24.260> improvements<00:03:24.560> as<00:03:25.280> i<00:03:25.400> said<00:03:25.609> before<00:03:26.409> you

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
few improvements as i said before you

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.289 
few improvements as i said before you
know<00:03:27.530> some<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.069> flaws<00:03:28.280> still<00:03:28.730> exist<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.209> i

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
know some of the flaws still exist and i

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.140 
know some of the flaws still exist and i
am<00:03:29.480> going<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:29.780> point<00:03:29.959> them<00:03:30.170> out<00:03:30.879> but<00:03:31.879> i'm<00:03:31.970> going

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
am going to point them out but i'm going

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.479 
am going to point them out but i'm going
to<00:03:32.209> talk<00:03:32.299> about<00:03:32.480> few<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.200> positives<00:03:33.829> because

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
to talk about few the positives because

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.800 
to talk about few the positives because
i<00:03:34.730> got<00:03:34.879> all<00:03:35.060> year<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:36.650> point<00:03:36.920> out<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.159> flaws

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
i got all year to point out the flaws

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.300 
i got all year to point out the flaws
are<00:03:38.810> another<00:03:39.079> example<00:03:39.260> how<00:03:39.680> sliders<00:03:40.159> can

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
are another example how sliders can

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.119 
are another example how sliders can
include<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.849> gameplay<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.690> help<00:03:42.530> minimize

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
include the gameplay and help minimize

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.819 
include the gameplay and help minimize
some<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.700> terrible<00:03:44.090> AI<00:03:45.079> achieving

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
some of the terrible AI achieving

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.910 
some of the terrible AI achieving
tactics<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.579> they<00:03:46.909> tend<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:47.720> use<00:03:47.989> very

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
tactics that they tend to use very

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.330 
tactics that they tend to use very
frequently<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:50.030> all<00:03:50.180> men<00:03:50.450> as<00:03:50.750> well<00:03:50.989> as<00:03:51.260> All<00:03:51.620> Pro

frequently on all men as well as All Pro
as<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:53.720> said<00:03:53.959> before<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.730> football<00:03:56.120> has<00:03:56.569> a

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
as I said before the football has a

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.920 
as I said before the football has a
tendency<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.400> come<00:03:58.400> in<00:03:58.549> very<00:03:59.030> low<00:03:59.359> on<00:03:59.659> those

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
tendency to come in very low on those

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.680 
tendency to come in very low on those
top<00:04:00.230> two<00:04:00.260> levels<00:04:00.859> in<00:04:01.549> which<00:04:01.849> case<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.389> allows

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
top two levels in which case it allows

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.099 
top two levels in which case it allows
the<00:04:03.019> defender<00:04:03.560> who<00:04:04.040> can<00:04:04.250> be<00:04:04.660> 526<00:04:05.660> yards<00:04:05.720> of

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
the defender who can be 526 yards of

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.759 
the defender who can be 526 yards of
late<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:06.590> jump<00:04:06.859> up<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.190> deflect<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.669> past

June<00:04:09.769> see<00:04:09.949> the<00:04:10.220> football<00:04:10.639> comes<00:04:11.269> down<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.870> this

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
June see the football comes down on this

that's<00:04:16.039> trailing<00:04:16.519> here<00:04:17.470> if<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.620> was<00:04:18.829> all

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
that's trailing here if this was all

that's trailing here if this was all
madden<00:04:19.519> he<00:04:20.329> would<00:04:20.720> jump<00:04:21.530> up<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:21.919> deflect<00:04:22.310> this

madden he would jump up and deflect this
because<00:04:24.139> many<00:04:24.919> people<00:04:25.010> have<00:04:25.340> several

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
because many people have several

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.820 
because many people have several

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
demonstrations that that still happens

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.700 
demonstrations that that still happens
in<00:04:28.039> this<00:04:28.190> game<00:04:28.780> but<00:04:29.780> because<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.110> how<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.349> just

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
in this game but because of how I just

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.589 
in this game but because of how I just
said<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.490> sliders<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.820> what<00:04:35.150> happens

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
said the sliders that is what happens

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.629 
said the sliders that is what happens

it's<00:05:04.719> just<00:05:05.050> going<00:05:05.199> to<00:05:05.349> knock<00:05:05.650> down<00:05:05.680> anyway<00:05:06.460> but

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
it's just going to knock down anyway but

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.879 
it's just going to knock down anyway but
you<00:05:07.419> can<00:05:07.569> force<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.020> computer<00:05:08.379> to<00:05:08.499> actually

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
you can force the computer to actually

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.339 
you can force the computer to actually
have<00:05:09.129> to<00:05:09.340> play<00:05:09.550> defense<00:05:09.849> and<00:05:10.389> I've<00:05:11.080> thrown

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
have to play defense and I've thrown

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.679 
have to play defense and I've thrown
this<00:05:11.499> past<00:05:11.770> one<00:05:12.069> purpose<00:05:12.520> into<00:05:12.819> triple

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689 
this past one purpose into triple

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.559 
this past one purpose into triple
coverage<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:15.669> will<00:05:15.789> make<00:05:15.939> the<00:05:16.090> catch<00:05:16.300> and

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
coverage you will make the catch and

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.230 
coverage you will make the catch and
then<00:05:17.499> they<00:05:17.650> will<00:05:17.800> do<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:20.139> animation<00:05:21.240> the

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
then they will do the animation the

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.679 
then they will do the animation the

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
tackle animation causes my player to

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.230 
tackle animation causes my player to
slow<00:05:25.689> down<00:05:25.870> just<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.259> little<00:05:26.409> bit<00:05:26.529> but<00:05:26.939> the<00:05:27.939> no

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
slow down just a little bit but the no

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.879 
slow down just a little bit but the no
threshold<00:05:30.659> causes<00:05:31.659> my<00:05:31.779> player<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.229> continue

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
threshold causes my player to continue

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.730 
threshold causes my player to continue
with<00:05:33.250> his<00:05:33.430> momentum<00:05:34.319> to<00:05:35.319> where<00:05:35.439> he<00:05:35.560> can<00:05:35.680> be

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
with his momentum to where he can be

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.559 
with his momentum to where he can be
dragged<00:05:36.219> on<00:05:36.520> it<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:37.169> threshold<00:05:38.169> was<00:05:38.409> at<00:05:38.500> 50

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
dragged on it the threshold was at 50

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.719 
dragged on it the threshold was at 50
right<00:05:40.569> here<00:05:40.990> I'd<00:05:41.409> fall<00:05:42.009> to<00:05:42.159> the<00:05:42.279> ground<00:05:44.610> as<00:05:45.610> you

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
right here I'd fall to the ground as you

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.429 
right here I'd fall to the ground as you
can<00:05:45.879> see<00:05:45.969> I<00:05:46.029> gained<00:05:46.330> about<00:05:46.479> three<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.229> four

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
can see I gained about three to four

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.300 
can see I gained about three to four
more<00:05:47.770> yards<00:05:49.110> after<00:05:50.110> he<00:05:50.409> makes<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.830> initial

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
more yards after he makes the initial

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.380 
more yards after he makes the initial
hit

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.760 

so<00:05:56.960> again<00:05:57.950> many<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.490> these<00:05:59.230> cheating<00:06:00.230> tactics

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
so again many of these cheating tactics

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.180 
so again many of these cheating tactics
that<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:01.070> AI<00:06:01.540> uses<00:06:02.540> against<00:06:03.050> us<00:06:03.230> can<00:06:03.860> be

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
that the AI uses against us can be

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.630 
that the AI uses against us can be
minimized<00:06:04.670> they<00:06:04.910> can<00:06:05.330> be<00:06:06.190> minimizing<00:06:07.190> can<00:06:07.520> be

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
minimized they can be minimizing can be

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.240 
minimized they can be minimizing can be
removed<00:06:07.970> from<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.330> gameplay<00:06:08.980> not<00:06:09.980> one

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
removed from the gameplay not one

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.170 
removed from the gameplay not one
hundred<00:06:10.430> percent<00:06:10.640> completely<00:06:11.570> but<00:06:12.940> enough<00:06:13.940> to

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
hundred percent completely but enough to

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.020 
hundred percent completely but enough to
where<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:15.170> computer<00:06:15.680> you<00:06:16.040> can<00:06:16.400> play<00:06:16.700> in<00:06:16.940> the

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
where the computer you can play in the

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.560 
where the computer you can play in the
computer<00:06:17.480> is<00:06:17.630> not<00:06:18.170> cheating
