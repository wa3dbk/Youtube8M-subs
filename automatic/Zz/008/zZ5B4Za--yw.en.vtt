00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.260 

the<00:00:17.020> trend<00:00:17.380> I<00:00:17.650> would<00:00:17.890> say<00:00:18.160> was<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.730> complete

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
the trend I would say was to complete

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.820 
the trend I would say was to complete
really<00:00:19.750> every<00:00:20.110> collection<00:00:20.500> with<00:00:21.400> maybe<00:00:21.910> new

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
really every collection with maybe new

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.740 
really every collection with maybe new
animation<00:00:23.830> also<00:00:24.040> I<00:00:24.430> think<00:00:24.849> people<00:00:25.270> are<00:00:25.480> also

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
animation also I think people are also

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.900 
animation also I think people are also
enjoying<00:00:26.349> to<00:00:26.560> have<00:00:26.770> something<00:00:27.279> new<00:00:27.520> every

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
enjoying to have something new every

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.300 
enjoying to have something new every
time<00:00:27.939> but<00:00:28.810> maybe<00:00:29.050> not<00:00:29.439> only<00:00:29.830> in<00:00:29.950> terms<00:00:30.189> of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
time but maybe not only in terms of

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.729 
time but maybe not only in terms of
movement<00:00:30.730> but<00:00:30.849> also<00:00:30.970> in<00:00:31.240> terms<00:00:31.360> of<00:00:31.509> aesthetic

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
movement but also in terms of aesthetic

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.990 
movement but also in terms of aesthetic
people<00:00:32.739> would<00:00:32.980> believe<00:00:33.309> that<00:00:33.340> paddock<00:00:33.760> Philip

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
people would believe that paddock Philip

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.460 
people would believe that paddock Philip

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
what we have done for the anniversary

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.709 
what we have done for the anniversary
was<00:01:43.780> just<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.109> beginning<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:46.090> terms<00:01:46.329> of<00:01:46.420> price

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
was just the beginning in terms of price

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.569 
was just the beginning in terms of price
we<00:01:46.990> made<00:01:47.140> also<00:01:47.469> some<00:01:47.679> changes<00:01:48.189> of<00:01:48.310> course

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
we made also some changes of course

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.489 
we made also some changes of course
because<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.240> swiss<00:01:49.479> price<00:01:49.749> became<00:01:50.229> way<00:01:50.469> too

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
because the swiss price became way too

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.069 
because the swiss price became way too
high<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:52.210> also<00:01:52.359> have<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.659> understand

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
high but you also have to understand

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.989 
high but you also have to understand
that<00:01:53.140> it's<00:01:53.499> going<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.740> move<00:01:53.950> again<00:01:54.189> and<00:01:54.820> we

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
that it's going to move again and we

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.139 
that it's going to move again and we
know<00:01:55.179> that<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:55.960> we<00:01:56.170> have<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.380> adapt<00:01:56.859> ourselves

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
know that so we have to adapt ourselves

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.950 
know that so we have to adapt ourselves
definitively<00:01:58.149> because<00:01:58.450> i<00:01:58.570> think<00:01:58.630> that's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
definitively because i think that's

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.469 
definitively because i think that's
important<00:01:59.409> for<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.619> client<00:02:00.039> also<00:02:00.310> but<00:02:01.149> on<00:02:01.359> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
important for the client also but on the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.179 
important for the client also but on the
other<00:02:01.569> side<00:02:01.899> we<00:02:02.259> are<00:02:02.319> not<00:02:02.619> controlling<00:02:03.159> that

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
other side we are not controlling that

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.130 
other side we are not controlling that
sometimes<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.390> lose<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> little<00:02:04.929> bit

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
sometimes you can lose a little bit

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.499 
sometimes you can lose a little bit
sometimes<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.829> gain<00:02:06.069> but<00:02:06.969> we<00:02:07.119> should<00:02:07.299> look

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
sometimes we can gain but we should look

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.570 
sometimes we can gain but we should look
also<00:02:07.749> as<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> long-term<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.100> know<00:02:09.220> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
also as a long-term you know the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.160 
also as a long-term you know the
investment<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.330> do<00:02:10.539> for<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> paddock

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
investment that you do for a paddock

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.350 
investment that you do for a paddock
today<00:02:11.470> maybe<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.190> will<00:02:12.430> pay<00:02:12.670> slightly<00:02:12.970> higher

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
today maybe you will pay slightly higher

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.410 
today maybe you will pay slightly higher
or<00:02:13.780> maybe<00:02:14.020> slightly<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.680> lower<00:02:15.130> price<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.000> at

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
or maybe slightly a lower price but at

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.540 
or maybe slightly a lower price but at
the<00:02:16.630> end<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:17.170> do<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.160> there<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.520> a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
the end I do not think that there is a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.760 
the end I do not think that there is a
major<00:02:18.850> changes<00:02:19.480> at<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:19.780> level<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.590> also

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
major changes at this level this is also

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.350 
major changes at this level this is also
something<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.220> our<00:02:21.490> client<00:02:21.940> knows

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
something that our client knows

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.700 
something that our client knows
about<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> they<00:02:22.900> are<00:02:22.960> willing<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.230> invest<00:02:23.560> in

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
about it they are willing to invest in

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.830 
about it they are willing to invest in
paddock<00:02:24.100> because<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.610> know<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.540> long-term

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
paddock because I know it's a long-term

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080 
paddock because I know it's a long-term
really<00:02:26.590> investment<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.370> there<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:27.820> another

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
really investment and there was another

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.430 
really investment and there was another
rarity<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.780> product<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:31.270> decided<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:31.930> we

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
rarity of the product we decided that we

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.890 
rarity of the product we decided that we
would<00:02:32.680> go<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> major<00:02:33.730> building<00:02:34.390> but<00:02:34.780> this

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
would go for a major building but this

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.590 
would go for a major building but this
is<00:02:35.050> for<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.320> future<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:36.040> not<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.940> increase

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
is for the future it's not to increase

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.660 
is for the future it's not to increase
the<00:02:37.990> number<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.470> watches<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:39.220> didn't<00:02:39.460> calculate

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
the number of watches I didn't calculate

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.760 
the number of watches I didn't calculate
that<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> will<00:02:41.020> produce<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.590> hundred

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
that so that I will produce a hundred

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.640 
that so that I will produce a hundred
thousand<00:02:42.220> watches<00:02:42.700> no<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.510> need<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.380> space

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
thousand watches no I need the space

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.190 
thousand watches no I need the space
because<00:02:45.220> we<00:02:45.430> need<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.790> train<00:02:46.240> people<00:02:46.570> we<00:02:47.020> need

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
because we need to train people we need

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.680 
because we need to train people we need
also<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.590> lot<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.920> maybe<00:02:48.520> new<00:02:48.790> technology<00:02:49.450> I'm

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
also a lot of maybe new technology I'm

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.750 
also a lot of maybe new technology I'm
willing<00:02:49.959> always<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.500> discover<00:02:50.920> something<00:02:51.580> new

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
willing always to discover something new

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.030 
willing always to discover something new
I'm<00:02:52.209> willing<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> push<00:02:52.840> further<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.560> have<00:02:53.709> even

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
I'm willing to push further to have even

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.940 
I'm willing to push further to have even
a<00:02:54.250> better<00:02:54.550> movement<00:02:54.910> more<00:02:55.600> precise<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.620> all<00:02:56.800> of

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
a better movement more precise so all of

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.620 
a better movement more precise so all of
that<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.310> need<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.850> people<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.480> need

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
that you need the people and you need

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.840 
that you need the people and you need
the<00:02:58.780> space<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:59.050> do<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.709> this<00:03:00.220> building

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
the space to do it and this building

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.850 
the space to do it and this building
will<00:03:01.030> be<00:03:01.180> done<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.080> also<00:03:02.470> for<00:03:02.770> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
will be done for that and also for the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.010 
will be done for that and also for the
access<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.310> service<00:03:03.730> every<00:03:04.450> year<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.900> are

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
access to service every year we are

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.040 
access to service every year we are
fixing<00:03:05.470> roughly<00:03:05.980> 80,000<00:03:06.850> pieces<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.900> know

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
fixing roughly 80,000 pieces you know

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.900 
fixing roughly 80,000 pieces you know
and<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.500> something<00:03:09.070> where<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.610> need<00:03:09.850> a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and this is something where you need a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.120 
and this is something where you need a
lot<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.150> watchmaker<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:11.230> lot<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.590> spare<00:03:11.920> parts

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
lot of watchmaker a lot of spare parts

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.190 
lot of watchmaker a lot of spare parts
so<00:03:12.550> all<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:12.970> will<00:03:13.420> be<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.020> new

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
so all of that will be in this new

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.590 
so all of that will be in this new
building
