00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello and welcome to this video tutorial 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.470
 what 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.639
 leaving me a little bit of android I've done 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.460
 this video for people who 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.740
 they need some drivers for the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.180
 acer aspire of 500 and that can also 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.289
 serve for other people who have 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.929
 have to load a driver since 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 does not detect on the hard drive at the time of 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.370
 install the windows 7 good this me 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.920
 it happened to me 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.400
 and how does my hard drive 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.550
 problems that I had in 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680
 in slow formative and the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.390
 windows and I left this little screen in 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.400
 that I did not detect the hard drive 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.620
 so what did I do was look 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.680
 and such but it cost me a lot to find 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.500
 the controller and good yes 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.500
 I 'll give you an option if you have a 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.800
 goodbye that you can change the system 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.530
 so the hard disk 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.560
 if you can put it in and so you'll 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.110
 it would be much easier since you change 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.760
 and of the news of the problem only 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.040
 the problem is for hard drives 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.050
 that have sata connection but if you have 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.300
 connection and then you do not need the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.320
 true 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.080
 then good 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.260
 I got this out of here and well the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.750
 drivers was hard to find if 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.970
 you have for example another system other 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.070
 order another computer brand because what 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.570
 you look on the official page and 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 download the controls of the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.960
 controllers and the charges and there's 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.200
 no problem but in being by 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.229
 example on the official page to do 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.990
 aspires of 500 because there is not it but for 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.790
 xp but it was not worth to me 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.530
 so what did I do you can 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.409
 search search and then until what 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.399
 I found but it is very complicated 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.440
 find it so I'm going to share it 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.390
 with you 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.000
 good when you give you download 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.610
 controller 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 of sandra another window like this and you 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.720
 they examine and look for the route where 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.310
 have saved the drivers drivers 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.520
 is in the description of the video you give 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.200
 click downloads and downloads are 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.920
 download on your desktop where the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.990
 let's have it properly configured to download 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.980
 and then unzip them if you see a 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.980
 folder like this 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.440
 you will open and here are the controllers 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.320
 sata 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.020
 these these drivers keep it in 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.970
 a disk or a dvd one usb and you give 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.050
 examine and look for the route where there 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.170
 saved the drivers 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.340
 and it will list here 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.050
 selection controls what you want 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.790
 install here you press a list and you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 next day and then start loading 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.980
 the drivers on the hard drive and already 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.550
 in this window here because you already 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.820
 will appear the hard drive that you have in your 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.710
 computer and good what what has 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.620
 to do the next one and then continue with 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.410
 the installation and another problem also 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.690
 it's about the sound of your computer 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.810
 what a coast it cost me to find 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.610
 the sound drivers for acer 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.380
 aspire of 500 then here I leave you the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.390
 folder so you can install it is 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.790
 a real tech models version 5.1 or something 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.810
 around then then here are the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.810
 sound drivers 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.450
 I hope you can help this one 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.270
 only it is not to load it again 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.090
 for a sata hard drive to breathe 500 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.680
 but it can also be useful for others 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.630
 other computers that have another disk 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.930
 hard sata but the drivers and already the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.970
 downloads of your official page I know that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.760
 It will be easier for other brands of 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.420
 computers but in this case the acer 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.440
 aspire of 500 and the hp not the marks in 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.690
 general to do 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 hp well it's a little complicated to find 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.180
 the drivers 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.040
 and good I facilitated them in downloading 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.380
 download these drivers for the 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.630
 people who might need it, so 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.709
 until the next friends and hit the button 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.709
