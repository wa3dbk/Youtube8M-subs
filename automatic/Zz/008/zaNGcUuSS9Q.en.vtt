00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
more project the design process that I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
more project the design process that I
noticed<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.110> him<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.979> blossomed<00:01:41.460> tenfold

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
noticed in him just blossomed tenfold

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.940 
noticed in him just blossomed tenfold
right<00:01:42.420> away<00:01:42.600> he<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.350> involved<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
right away he was more involved in the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
right away he was more involved in the
mechanical<00:01:44.399> theory<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.540> he<00:01:46.020> he's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
mechanical theory right now he he's

interested<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> applying<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> his<00:01:47.729> math

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
interested in applying more of his math

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
beefy at the end of the year we were

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
beefy at the end of the year we were
trying<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.350> figure<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.310> solid<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
trying to figure out the solid that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.910 
trying to figure out the solid that
we're<00:01:53.880> gonna<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.689> intersecting<00:01:55.649> tooth

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
we're gonna get from intersecting tooth

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.179 
we're gonna get from intersecting tooth
alanders<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.140> trying<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
alanders and trying to see it on the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.330 
alanders and trying to see it on the
computer<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> trying

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
computer and trying

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.580 
computer and trying
to<00:02:00.490> ride<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.689> board<00:02:01.899> was<00:02:02.170> really

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
to ride on the board was really

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.139 
to ride on the board was really
difficult<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.159> was<00:02:03.369> like<00:02:03.490> oh<00:02:03.640> why<00:02:03.880> don't<00:02:04.090> I

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
difficult I was like oh why don't I

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.529 
difficult I was like oh why don't I
print<00:02:04.479> out<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.840> 3d<00:02:05.609> model<00:02:06.609> for<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.030> surface<00:02:07.359> I

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
print out a 3d model for the surface I

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.509 
print out a 3d model for the surface I
was<00:02:07.869> sitting<00:02:08.140> there<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:08.349> about<00:02:08.830> 30<00:02:09.220> minutes

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
was sitting there for about 30 minutes

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.490 
was sitting there for about 30 minutes
staring<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.509> printer<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.840> was<00:02:11.080> praying<00:02:11.349> a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
staring at the printer I was praying a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.400 
staring at the printer I was praying a
layer<00:02:11.709> by<00:02:11.980> layer<00:02:15.690> before<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.840> was<00:02:16.959> just<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.290> my

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
layer by layer before it was just in my

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.800 
layer by layer before it was just in my
mind<00:02:17.440> or<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.220> piece<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.549> paper<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.209> on<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
computer and that wasn't as cool as

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.460 
computer and that wasn't as cool as
having<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.450> project<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:22.959> your<00:02:23.080> hand<00:02:23.290> because

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
having the project in your hand because

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.130 
having the project in your hand because
you're<00:02:24.010> able<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.400> touch<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.180> you're<00:02:25.870> able

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you're able to touch it and you're able

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.160 
you're able to touch it and you're able
to<00:02:26.349> feel<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.860> project<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.310> well<00:02:27.750> mr.<00:02:28.750> Connick

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
to feel the project as well mr. Connick

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.289 
to feel the project as well mr. Connick
and<00:02:29.319> mr.<00:02:29.530> pious<00:02:29.769> my<00:02:30.160> other<00:02:30.430> engineering

and mr. pious my other engineering

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.750 
and mr. pious my other engineering
teacher<00:02:31.480> asked<00:02:32.140> me<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.470> create<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.769> instruction

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
teacher asked me to create a instruction

set<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.480> MakerBot<00:02:34.900> because<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.349> was

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
set on the MakerBot because I was

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.180 
set on the MakerBot because I was
working<00:02:35.650> on<00:02:35.890> it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
working on it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.069 
working on it
all<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.519> time<00:02:36.730> they<00:02:37.060> told<00:02:37.269> me<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.450> teach<00:02:37.989> you

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
all the time they told me to teach you

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.420 
all the time they told me to teach you
in<00:02:38.140> front<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.440> class<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
in front of class so that all the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.819 
in front of class so that all the
students<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.849> get<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.410> they're<00:02:41.410> students

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
students can get it they're students

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.140 
students can get it they're students
that<00:02:42.099> sometimes<00:02:42.459> they'll<00:02:42.819> look<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
that sometimes they'll look at the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.420 
that sometimes they'll look at the
picture<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.720> they'll<00:02:44.440> look<00:02:44.560> at<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.799> 3d<00:02:45.069> model

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
picture and they'll look at the 3d model

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.100 
picture and they'll look at the 3d model
and<00:02:45.700> they'll<00:02:45.910> say<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.569> just<00:02:46.750> walk<00:02:46.900> me

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
and they'll say can you just walk me

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.050 
and they'll say can you just walk me
through<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.349> once<00:02:47.530> more<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.060> they're

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
through it once more and they're

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.420 
through it once more and they're
probably<00:02:49.599> more<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.110> verbal<00:02:50.290> learner<00:02:50.680> some

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
probably more of a verbal learner some

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.119 
probably more of a verbal learner some
students<00:02:51.790> are<00:02:51.910> completely<00:02:52.360> visual<00:02:52.629> and<00:02:53.129> some

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
students are completely visual and some

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.100 
students are completely visual and some
of<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> students<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.390> most<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.900> them

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
of the students and now most of them

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.809 
of the students and now most of them
