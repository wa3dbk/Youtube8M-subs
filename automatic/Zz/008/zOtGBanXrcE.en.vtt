 comfortable driving for all 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 terms 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 the engine is designed to deliver a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 very large power terminal with 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.740
 can be used smoothly from 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 slow down to the red line if you 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.640
 are an experienced engine you know this 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 that means if you are not 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 let me explain when you turn 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.490
 the throttle the power and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.409
 acceleration is delivered exactly 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.689
 as you tender and no start 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.490

 control are one of the most 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.750
 important when it comes to a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.820
 driving on this eliminates all kinds 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.630
 of deliveries since censored for allows 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.939
 avoid nervous start 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.899
 the 300 m to more cuts compared to the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.670
 250 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.349
 this is a key element for life 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.000
 urban think about cuts like the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.260
 amount of greatly self-produced film 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.900
 when you want to go there 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.860
 the ascb 300f is perfect for the fight 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.080
 tales the stops and restarts 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.360

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 to get you out of delicate situations 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.989
 do not worry there is also 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.370
 a lot of power for the road to 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.349
 the moment you want to escape the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 city ​​and when you want to go on 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.910
 long trips the fuel economy of 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.830
 the ascb 300f is remarkable which 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.330
 means more time on the road and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.730
 less time to the gas bomb 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.510
 the 300m is as aggressive and agile as 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.310
 his luxury huggel 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.400
 it is light with a center of gravity 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.410
 down a seat and bc is a section of 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.450
 middle and 3 which means you'll have 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.400
 the trust and control required to 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.230
 all types of driving conditions 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.269
 moreover if the stock seat is not 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.370
 low enough for you honda offers a seat 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.890
 which is even narrower and does not pose 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.530
 further down the new cb 300 ended up with 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.360
 two serial abs channels in the room 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.130
 is one of the most 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.930
 important for a motorcycle and is not 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.209
 normally included in the category of 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.040
 the 300th drop could help 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.549
 to stand in a situation 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.739
 doubtful 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.390
 think of it like that the road surface 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.640
 you encounter during a situation 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.310
 emergency can be unpredictable but 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.060
 we the engines can also be 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.639
 unpredictable in this situation 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.500
 emergency even experienced motors can 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.120
 have difficulty modulating their 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.280
 brakes in a stop situation of 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.600
 surprise or panic if you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.489
 find on a high with some 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.079
 un- ideal conditions it's going to be pretty 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.030
 difficult to convince you to support 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.190
 on the lever and handle a braking 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.530
 abs can help you in this type of 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.269
 sensors situation determines when 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.040
 wheel lock is imminent 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.200
 it changes the pressure to prevent the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.880
 wheel lock remember this is the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.950
 gyroscopic force of the wheels that you 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.569
 makes stable the bay is in dha allows 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.910

 necessary to avoid an emergency 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.140
 perhaps that one of the things 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.710
 amazing about the 300m cable and
