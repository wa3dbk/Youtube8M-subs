00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
 and we are going to talk about everything that the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.160
 fourth stage that for the Argentines was 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.710
 tremendous that we started with the bikes 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 good we start with the bikes with are 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.940
 barrier 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.990
 the espanyol that with his sling returned to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.000
 win the cover 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.880
 and what must be highlighted here is that epi 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.250
 alone for the first time the best 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.890
 Argentine on a motorcycle could finish a 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.840
 stage without any mechanical problem what 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.119
 what did he do that will be placed in the position 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.210
 number 6 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.520
 of this root of which was to cross the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.180
 mountain range and get fully into the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.800
 desert before getting to copied the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.370
 good news is also that the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.769
 mendocino ayesa is out of danger 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.649
 He wore a horse with the bike with 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.290
 what that imagines to keep a 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.409
 equine talking in the middle of the track 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.309
 where the track of the motorcycles was 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:04.940
 and took the worst part in quads 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.940
 well we had anticipated it, it won 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.710
 rafael are polish but honest the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.610
 Argentine who had just won a stage 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.890
 long he could not make his cuatri walk and he 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.860
 stayed out better Argentine was in the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.020
 fifth position Gonzalez same position 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.369
 for hardware 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.460
 is located just in the fifth in 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.430

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.590
 in trucks mom the russians as always 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.729
 and in a good car I already said tremendous what 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.520
 that forces them you do not go grabbed a stone 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.950
 that literally embedded in the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.680
 rear wheel drive to break the wheel and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.580
 He was more d 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.100
 but lying is 10 hours thrown trying 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.090
 to repair the problem came almost to the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.400
 2 in the morning to bivouac and still not 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 he knows if he will be able to leave the same in the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.930
 general 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.420
