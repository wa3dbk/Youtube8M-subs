 [Music] 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 [Applause] 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.620

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.110
 purchases and that me and rossi were going 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.690
 a very nice evening with grandma 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 so you do not paint with me granny 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.610
 now I can not that I will do it when 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.160
 finish ironing is now 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.830
 stalling for this shirt to be 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.349
 smooth and soft I gave it to grandfather 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 for his pleasant birthday he has invited me to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.519
 your birthday party 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.980
 because he has not celebrated any hair and 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.760
 you could imagine a birthday without 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.000
 birthday party that grandpa does not 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.910
 he was very animated he did not want anything 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.489
 celebrate it then we will make a party 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 and that seems to me a great idea leaves 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.649
 to take a big surprise 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.899
 the costumes hats the game of 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.070
 put the tail on the donkey and an afternoon of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.170
 birthday 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.440
 then we are going to need a lot of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.440
 material 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.080
 I want a lot of colored pencils 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.460
 I know we have more colored pencils in 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.600
 somewhere 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.600
 [Music] 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.580
 I guess you still need a few tweaks 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.340
 [Music] 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.790
 a granny needs to hang the burrito 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.760
 somewhere 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.879
 [Music] 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.879
 [Applause] 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.540
 [Music] 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.810
 I knew you would find the perfect place 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.650
 that I thought that the decoration 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.710
 It was very good but there was still something missing 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.120
 We need to record grandma, I think that still 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.090
 there are some of your party 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.519
 birthday 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.519
 [Music] 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 and I'm afraid you're still small 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.890
 to inflate balloons that I was 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.979
 disappointed because he still could not 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.369
 puff a balloon but suddenly remembered 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.539
 something I could do look what I know 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.539
 make grandma 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.450
 go often trick that I want to put 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.690
 other 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.690
 [Music] 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.410
 and nothing happens remember that you have to 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.590
 rub it more gently like that of 'la 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.140
 is 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.480
 [Music] 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.110
 with these candles have for all 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.510
 grandma's years I'm afraid that for that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 and we will need many candles do 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.460
 it seems to you if we put a candle for each 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 invited to come the party that I 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.120
 I really wanted Grandpa 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.970

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.980

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.430
