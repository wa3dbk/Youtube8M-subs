00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.100
 specific for nintendo 3ds this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.670
 proposal as such is available for

 wii yum 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.100
 ps vita and precision 3 we analyze the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.660
 version for the latter the game will 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.390
 It divides into two slopes in mode 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 history and the battle coliseum in the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 first we will witness some of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.129
 the most remarkable events to which 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 refers to manga anime with 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.670
 final confrontations against many of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.220
 the most popular enemies among 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.720
 fans in the limited world red not only 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.250
 we must go eliminating the enemies that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.140
 they come to our path 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.820
 towards the final phase enemy but 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.049
 also recovering all kinds of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.280
 materials 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.170
 you have to get wood starting 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 trees banks or boxes get coconuts 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.680
 hitting palm trees parts of rocks 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 breaking stones and doing the same 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.580
 with cactus plants bushes and others 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.110
 crafting elements you have a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.270
 remarkable prominence in this adventure 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.340
 Each store or trade requires certain 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.840
 quantities of x ingredient and it will be 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 habitual revisit some of the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 missions 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 get the necessary materials 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.010
 plant seeds to grow some 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.500
 organic materials also results 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 useful shortly after starting to play and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 meet the first missions we can 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.540
 unblock the tavern from which you 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 gives us in secondary missions 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.160
 that reward us with money and experience 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.140
 in these we are shown the maximum 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.880
 characters that should participate and in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 certain cases we are forced to play with 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.280
 this or that character the entire opening of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.050
 the island is made from the inn place 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 where we rest and we can save 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.310
 games at the beginning little thing we can 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.020
 do on the island more than meet several 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.330
 missions and talk to some of your 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
 inhabitants in fact all trades 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.680
 they will be closed and we will have to go 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.110
 opening buying or as it is called in 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.030
 the game expanding the island with 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.769
 businesses or services thanks to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.030
 elements that we collect during 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.530
 missions 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 the proposal starts with all the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.519
 members of straw hat mooring 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.410
 the boat on the island of promises after 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.019
 rest from the trip all our 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.209
 comrades are kidnapped having to go 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.530
 to them and we are finding everyone 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.930
 and see who is behind this 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.430
 kidnapping is only half of what we 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.799
 propose this development production 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.540
 because in several like this we will begin the 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.969
 first of our missions locating 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 already several of them down the road in 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.030
 how much we find the first ones and already 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.159
 we can select them to form 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.780
 our team of three selecting the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.340
 always before leaving for each 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.889
 mission as we go 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 unlocking the other two will be 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.000
 controlled by the cpu although a second 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.290
 player can join cooperatively and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
 control either of the two 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.659
 remaining is advisable to go changing 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.879
 of character so that they all rise 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.400
 level equally and present more 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.900
 Efficiency in battle we can control 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.549
 any of the three jump from one to 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.060
 another at any time by pressing 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.489
 select 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.379
 In the case at hand, indicate with the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.720
 characters are more effective in attacks 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.189
 Close others to average and others stand out 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.799
 for his long strong attacks 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.900
 distance know how to balance the equipment is 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.840
 essential to face each mission with 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.030
 highest percentage of success the characters 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.430
 they present different attacks based on 5 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.219
 attack attack strong attack 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.359
 fast attack and special attack 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.370
 combining or repeating pulsations 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.080
 between both attack buttons we perform 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.580
 different combos 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.320
 under the life bar we have the meter 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.630
 of experience points that we fill 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.090
 by eliminating enemies allowing us 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.910
 make a special attack more or less 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.620
 potent we use a locker or all at 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.060
 press the top right button on 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.590
 combination with any of the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.140
 buttons indicated on the bottom 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.170
 right making a special attack 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.000
 what these turn out to be the most 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.340
 showcases of the game highlighting in 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.740
 special in fused attack or set 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.750
 among all the members in the heat of 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.580
 the battle will also appear the r1 button 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.710
 that when you press it, you execute one of the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.450
 words that we have selected well 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.220
 to encourage the team or to 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.720
 execute special actions like cure 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.990
 to all team members in 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.850
 function of the selected characters 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.500
 these words are very helpful and 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.420
 we are collecting them and finding them 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.300
 During the game there are several types 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.710
 some open blocked roads although 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.750
 the majority serve to enhance 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.850
 attributes of each of the characters 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.290
 to give variety to the development of 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.990
 game some mini-games have been included 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.370
 how to hunt animals or fish in both 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.680
 cases we have to press the buttons 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.360
 indicated just when they appear 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.340
 the duration of the story without fulfilling 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.590
 no secondary mission is around 8 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.970
 approximate hours even if it's almost to start 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.220
 up to 12 if we meet all the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.750
 secondary and more than 15 if we try 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.150
 meet all the challenges of the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.800
 citizens of the xxi the gameplay of this 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.620
 mode is divided into two parts the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.090
 exploration and confrontations perhaps 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.100
 could have included more variety 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.780
 in the combos but it meets the 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.360
 offer the typical blows of each 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.880
 character the second offer or mode of 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.800
 game the battle coliseum proposes us 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.080
 fight in a sand in different 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.509
 tests either against final bosses or 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.430
 against groups of enemies these battles 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.729
 they give us experience with which we will go 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.130
 rising as a fighter these combats 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.860
 usually last a few minutes and force us 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.139
 to use x character indicated dose of 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.180
 action and good variety of challenges in this 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.970
 proposal that lengthens about 3 or 4 hours 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.860
 plus the original game on the graphic level the 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.870
 cell shading aspect manages to give fidelity 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.699
 to the series offering a very 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.830
 similar to that of the television series of 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.270
 'toy animation the moments more 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.190
 highlights are appreciated when 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.870
 we execute the special movements of 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.210
 each of the characters 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.130
 the rest of the actions could not have been 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.510
 could a little more since some 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.390
 animations are missing some 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.220
 transitions and the camera does not help either 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.140
 sometimes there are two enemies left 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.400
 screen the game reaches 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.710
 located with the voices in English 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.080
 typical of the series with subtitles in 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.550
 castellano juan pizza unlimited world 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.470
 is especially aimed at 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.240
 followers of the series although the neophyte 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.610
 You can also enter for the first time 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 to the wampis universe thanks to the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.850
 narration that we are becoming of the 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.220
 facts and to the presentation of each one 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.080
 of the characters introducing us in the 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.090
 proposal almost without realizing and 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.310
 motivating us to constantly move 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.450
 towards another mission a remarkable and 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.450
 recommended proposal
