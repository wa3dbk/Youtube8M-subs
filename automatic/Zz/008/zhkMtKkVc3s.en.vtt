00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's about so apparently according to

it's about so apparently according to
this<00:01:17.729> post<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.360> game<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.720> confirmed<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this post the game is confirmed to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.760 
this post the game is confirmed to
include<00:01:19.860> over<00:01:20.220> 70<00:01:20.759> characters<00:01:21.320> from<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
include over 70 characters from all of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.690 
include over 70 characters from all of
the<00:01:22.890> Dragon<00:01:23.250> Ball<00:01:23.400> Z<00:01:23.430> arcs<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:25.430> 70<00:01:26.430> characters

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the Dragon Ball Z arcs so 70 characters

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.980 
the Dragon Ball Z arcs so 70 characters
and<00:01:27.420> i'm<00:01:27.780> pretty<00:01:28.020> sure<00:01:28.229> each<00:01:28.439> character<00:01:29.040> has

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and i'm pretty sure each character has

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.109 
and i'm pretty sure each character has
so<00:01:30.990> let's<00:01:31.259> say<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.680> through<00:01:31.950> goku<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.880> have

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so let's say go through goku will have

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.469 
so let's say go through goku will have
four<00:01:33.840> transformations<00:01:34.759> Super<00:01:35.759> seven<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.119> two

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
four transformations Super seven one two

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.289 
four transformations Super seven one two
three<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.560> Super<00:01:37.890> Saiyan<00:01:38.070> God<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.119> I'm

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
three and Super Saiyan God so I'm

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.590 
three and Super Saiyan God so I'm
assuming<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.939> makes<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> count<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
assuming that I makes the count up to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.690 
assuming that I makes the count up to
five<00:01:42.810> characters<00:01:43.380> transformations<00:01:44.220> equals

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
five characters transformations equals

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.670 
five characters transformations equals
characters<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.079> we've<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.409> several

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
characters so if we've got several

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
characters so if we've got several
characters<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.399> transformations<00:01:48.119> like

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
characters with transformations like

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.660 
characters with transformations like
vegeta<00:01:48.630> trunks<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.049> cell<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.409> Frieza<00:01:53.100> that's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
vegeta trunks and cell and Frieza that's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.760 
vegeta trunks and cell and Frieza that's
like<00:01:53.939> nearly<00:01:55.520> 25<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.840> characters<00:01:58.530> right

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
like nearly 25 or so characters right

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.429 
like nearly 25 or so characters right
there<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.270> assume<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> list

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
there so we can assume that the list

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950 
there so we can assume that the list
might<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> little<00:02:02.520> bit<00:02:02.820> teeny<00:02:03.270> because

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
might be a little bit teeny because

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.160 
might be a little bit teeny because
again<00:02:04.799> transformations<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:05.670> count<00:02:05.909> as

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
again transformations will count as

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.999 
again transformations will count as
characters

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
characters

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.190

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.070 
so unfortunately that seems like you
guys<00:04:26.979> might<00:04:27.400> miss<00:04:27.759> out<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.900> other<00:04:29.050> reason

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
guys might miss out and the other reason

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.930 
guys might miss out and the other reason
I<00:04:29.319> say<00:04:29.470> might<00:04:29.680> is<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.129> as<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.520> previously

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
I say might is because as I previously

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.649 
I say might is because as I previously
said<00:04:31.270> before<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.990> maybe<00:04:32.819> these<00:04:33.819> are<00:04:33.879> sort<00:04:34.569> of

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
said before that maybe these are sort of

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.100 
said before that maybe these are sort of
like<00:04:34.740> early<00:04:35.740> deal<00:04:36.580> sees<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.210> we're<00:04:37.720> getting

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
like early deal sees the we're getting

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.839 
like early deal sees the we're getting
and<00:04:38.319> then<00:04:38.500> they'll<00:04:38.650> release<00:04:39.039> them<00:04:39.340> further

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
and then they'll release them further

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.649 
and then they'll release them further
down<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.330> track<00:04:41.550> two<00:04:42.550> or<00:04:42.729> so<00:04:42.940> months<00:04:43.150> after
