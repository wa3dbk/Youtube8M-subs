00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hey everyone, what's the catch? 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.130
 in this attraction's archive video for 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.780
 you my analysis of the training of the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.969
 next should be that of the cup two that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.849
 call national sales i will only speak 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.440
 about the new kelburn zombie map as well 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.970
 For a start, I'll explain to you. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.859
 because Lupi said in arrears that are 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480
 seeing the reason for this place because 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.609
 leave the whole lot there for you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 while I speak I have a chance to attract the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.910
 make a video fall out of the air and to avoid 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.680
 What happened is only part of the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.210
 trailer that most emphasize what I am 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 talking repeating itself 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 well to start the name of a band like 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 I already said the translation before the letter 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.000
 in Portuguese would be buried then go 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 be something to do with buried the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 map name on the chile canopy in 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 Portuguese and the style of the map that will speak 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 by itself a typical old-west city 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.039
 underneath the earth will well have the four 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 characters returned in which the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.840
 character of the starting team and are already 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 back did not like a good idea and they 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 also talked about how to have more information 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 about the history of both the map with the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.070
 game characters plus a bit of 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.470
 probably completing information 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 debuts something like this and one thing 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.860
 that I also realized that the four 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.020
 characters means that it will 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.820
 to use your feet in case you know 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.780
 have a way to play a project that will 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 in transit and in the base or with 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.990
 This character back I think a lot 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 positive that we will be able to use 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 both looking for the game that goes pro 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.360
 so a tip that I'm leaving 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.310
 ahead for you is where you play 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.490
 map you already have ready and that will 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.259
 Well, what you said about the boss is 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 He never really said anything about the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.460
 boxing if what they said they will have 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.170
 a new character and depending on what the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.790
 people decide to do it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 he can turn our enemy into the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.810
 benefit to us what I imagine as 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.540
 Are you seeing where he's walking? 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.189
 a little what I imagine is that he will have 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.320
 path on the map and the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 We have to help him if we can. 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.799
 Shoot him with the desire to kill him 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.240
 something like doing something that 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.380
 It happened to him and he will get to 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.939
 little we will see our enemy 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.659
 When I tried to kill people, something 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.310
 of the type 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.740
 if he can get to a place that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.689
 Do not accept that you're there. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.920
 if he can get to this place 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.380
 people to win no prize is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.720
 possibly how to get part of the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.009
 interreg or pick up the ruler mark 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.319
 the new pandemic because it is 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.830
 Speaking of you, but what I 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.810
 think 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.060
 I'm not saying anything of what I think. 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.370
 probably not may not 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.840
 some kind of coverage for 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.370
 him for him to get a place 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.950
 maybe we have to give points for 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.090
 so I do not know but I think some 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.190
 such thing 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.010
 well the new currency the yuan the rule mark 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.840
 two and that as it is known is that everyone 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.820
 likes the regan they did to complain 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.950
 of two rings reaching the mark of 2 is 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.090
 no matter how small she may be 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.810
 also relatively poorly. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.080
 great 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.150
 Charging appeared and is much more powerful 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.610
 because her uncle through an encore to 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.720
 can kill more than one shot only will it 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.760
 be used to kill a bunch of zombies 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.410
 along with one with styles that enliven 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.660
 said during the trailer 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.790
 The map leaves on July 2 that will be 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.260
 a Tuesday and I think it's going to leave 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 at the same time as the old maps 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.660
 that it will be around six 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.490
 morning 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.320
 a little before or a little later then 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.670
 in case you do not have 1 on Tuesday 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.430
 I recommend you wake up at six in the morning 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.470
 What I'm doing to be able to download 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.090
 the map already start playing in it then 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.470
 smaller people are staying right here 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.720
 I hope that the analyzes have given a 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.970
 best perspective for you on this map 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.370
 and do not forget my tip that I said 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.560
 for you to catch the game in which they scratch 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.769
 was the other pec pro before you 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.970
 start playing on this map and make 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.739
 around six in the morning as I said 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.420
 which will launch on July 2 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.920
 and if you liked the video, leave a like 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.420
 Did you not like a slip that also 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.709

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.760
