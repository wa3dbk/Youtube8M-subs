will add in garlic and I'm taking very

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.089 
will add in garlic and I'm taking very
little<00:03:41.569> oil<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:42.259> firstly<00:03:42.769> because<00:03:43.009> I'm

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
little oil in this firstly because I'm

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.229 
little oil in this firstly because I'm
using<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.400> nonstick<00:03:43.609> pan<00:03:43.879> and<00:03:44.359> secondly<00:03:45.349> is

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
using a nonstick pan and secondly is

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.030 
using a nonstick pan and secondly is
them<00:03:47.239> you<00:03:47.930> don't<00:03:48.049> really<00:03:48.199> need<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.680> take<00:03:48.829> so

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
them you don't really need to take so

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.249 
them you don't really need to take so
much<00:03:49.159> oil<00:03:49.340> because<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:49.790> just<00:03:50.000> go<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.239> stir<00:03:50.989> fry

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:51.259 
much oil because we just go to stir fry

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.699 
much oil because we just go to stir fry
this

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
this

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.249 
this
so<00:03:52.370> after<00:03:53.030> garlic<00:03:53.509> goes<00:03:53.780> in<00:03:53.810> ginger<00:03:56.079> okay

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:57.259 
so after garlic goes in ginger okay

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.759 
so after garlic goes in ginger okay
now<00:03:58.599> before<00:03:59.599> we<00:03:59.719> add<00:03:59.840> in<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.019> chillies<00:04:00.349> I

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
now before we add in the chillies I

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.170 
now before we add in the chillies I
suggest<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.609> we<00:04:01.790> add<00:04:01.969> the<00:04:02.479> peppers<00:04:03.879> why<00:04:04.879> is

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
suggest that we add the peppers why is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.059 
suggest that we add the peppers why is
because<00:04:05.419> if<00:04:05.659> you<00:04:05.780> add<00:04:05.930> chillies<00:04:06.319> directly<00:04:06.979> to

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
because if you add chillies directly to

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.449 
because if you add chillies directly to
the<00:04:07.159> pan<00:04:07.370> you'll<00:04:08.090> start<00:04:08.359> coughing<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.680> some

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the pan you'll start coughing so some

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.059 
the pan you'll start coughing so some
yellow<00:04:11.150> peppers<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.810> now<00:04:12.139> to<00:04:12.199> this<00:04:12.590> meal<00:04:12.889> add

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
yellow peppers and now to this meal add

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.569 
yellow peppers and now to this meal add
in<00:04:13.219> the<00:04:13.689> red<00:04:14.689> chillies

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.950 

now<00:04:19.579> let's<00:04:20.480> add<00:04:21.019> some<00:04:21.370> fish<00:04:22.370> sauce<00:04:22.930> fish<00:04:23.930> sauce

seared 1 1 or 1 and 1/2 minute on each
side<00:06:10.330> is<00:06:10.749> sufficient<00:06:11.229> for<00:06:11.379> the<00:06:11.469> fish<00:06:11.649> to<00:06:11.680> cook

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
side is sufficient for the fish to cook

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.249 
side is sufficient for the fish to cook
if<00:06:12.309> it's<00:06:12.490> nice<00:06:12.699> thin<00:06:13.089> fillets<00:06:13.449> is<00:06:13.839> a<00:06:13.899> fillet

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259 
if it's nice thin fillets is a fillet

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.019 
if it's nice thin fillets is a fillet
steak<00:06:14.319> then<00:06:14.889> probably<00:06:15.189> 2<00:06:15.430> to<00:06:15.459> 2<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:15.699> a<00:06:15.849> half

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:16.029 
steak then probably 2 to 2 and a half

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.119 
steak then probably 2 to 2 and a half
minutes<00:06:16.209> on<00:06:16.449> each<00:06:16.569> side<00:06:16.599> do<00:06:17.409> not<00:06:17.439> overcook<00:06:17.949> the

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
minutes on each side do not overcook the

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.609 
minutes on each side do not overcook the
fish<00:06:18.159> because<00:06:18.610> it<00:06:18.729> will<00:06:19.389> give<00:06:20.020> out<00:06:20.169> all<00:06:20.409> the

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:20.619 
fish because it will give out all the

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.139 
fish because it will give out all the
moisture<00:06:21.129> and<00:06:21.159> it<00:06:21.399> will<00:06:21.490> leave<00:06:21.699> the<00:06:21.909> meat

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:22.149 
moisture and it will leave the meat

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.920 
moisture and it will leave the meat
quite<00:06:22.569> dry<00:06:23.309> actually<00:06:24.309> that<00:06:24.819> is<00:06:24.999> applicable<00:06:25.749> to

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
quite dry actually that is applicable to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.329 
quite dry actually that is applicable to
most<00:06:26.289> of<00:06:26.499> the<00:06:26.619> needs<00:06:26.800> which<00:06:27.009> are<00:06:27.159> high<00:06:27.309> in

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:27.339 
most of the needs which are high in

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:29.309 
most of the needs which are high in
protein<00:06:27.610> when<00:06:28.270> you<00:06:28.360> overcook<00:06:28.809> anything<00:06:29.169> for

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
protein when you overcook anything for

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.839 
protein when you overcook anything for
example<00:06:29.680> chicken<00:06:30.009> if<00:06:30.129> you<00:06:30.189> overcook<00:06:30.550> chicken

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:30.849 
example chicken if you overcook chicken

example chicken if you overcook chicken
what<00:06:30.999> happens<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.389> goes<00:06:31.539> stuff<00:06:31.899> there<00:06:32.860> the

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
what happens it goes stuff there the

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.469 
what happens it goes stuff there the
same<00:06:33.159> reason<00:06:33.459> with<00:06:33.580> fish<00:06:33.789> also<00:06:34.029> go<00:06:34.270> over

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
same reason with fish also go over

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.929 
same reason with fish also go over
quickly<00:06:34.809> it<00:06:35.020> goes<00:06:35.229> quite<00:06:35.469> dry<00:06:35.830> so<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.580> fish<00:06:36.789> is

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
quickly it goes quite dry so the fish is

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.959 
quickly it goes quite dry so the fish is
done<00:06:37.149> let's<00:06:37.569> switch<00:06:37.870> off<00:06:38.080> the<00:06:38.289> heat<00:06:38.529> now

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
done let's switch off the heat now
