think<00:02:05.539> there's<00:02:05.810> way<00:02:06.679> fact<00:02:06.979> there<00:02:07.159> is<00:02:07.280> a

think there's way fact there is a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
think there's way fact there is a
dangerous<00:02:07.850> as<00:02:08.000> car<00:02:08.300> being<00:02:08.600> underpowered

ride<00:04:05.380> all<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.610> all<00:04:06.760> this<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.209> very<00:04:07.510> very<00:04:07.900> good

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
ride all in all this is a very very good

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.300 
ride all in all this is a very very good
car<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.590> drive<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:10.800> able<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.890> feel<00:04:12.040> very

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
car to drive and able to feel very

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.979 
car to drive and able to feel very
comfortable<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.090> drive<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.480> car<00:04:13.720> long

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
comfortable to drive this car long

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.550 
comfortable to drive this car long
distance<00:04:15.150> it's<00:04:16.150> certainly<00:04:16.540> not<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.810> tiring<00:04:17.169> car

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
distance it's certainly not a tiring car

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.099 
distance it's certainly not a tiring car
to<00:04:17.739> drive<00:04:17.980> it's<00:04:18.730> well<00:04:18.970> put<00:04:19.180> together<00:04:19.359> it's

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
to drive it's well put together it's

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.520 
to drive it's well put together it's
well<00:04:20.320> engineered<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:22.480> only<00:04:22.720> criticism<00:04:23.200> I

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
well engineered the only criticism I

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.590 
well engineered the only criticism I
really<00:04:24.070> will<00:04:24.310> stick<00:04:24.639> with<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.210> fact<00:04:25.419> that

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
really will stick with is the fact that

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.900 
really will stick with is the fact that
I<00:04:25.750> think<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.050> engine<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.730> little

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
I think the engine is a little

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.120 
I think the engine is a little
underpowered<00:04:28.419> on<00:04:28.900> acceleration<00:04:29.500> so<00:04:29.919> if<00:04:30.040> you

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
underpowered on acceleration so if you

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.670 
underpowered on acceleration so if you
were<00:04:30.250> pulling<00:04:30.550> out<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:31.389> junctions<00:04:31.960> or<00:04:32.110> around

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
were pulling out the junctions or around

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.170 
were pulling out the junctions or around
about<00:04:32.979> where<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.370> needed<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.790> get<00:04:33.910> up<00:04:34.060> to

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
about where you needed to get up to

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.350 
about where you needed to get up to
speed<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.979> get<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.490> flow<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.760> traffic

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
speed to get it to the flow of traffic

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.570 
speed to get it to the flow of traffic
I<00:04:37.590> think<00:04:38.590> you'd<00:04:38.740> have<00:04:38.860> problems<00:04:39.280> with<00:04:39.430> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
I think you'd have problems with the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.450 
I think you'd have problems with the
acceleration<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:41.139> also<00:04:41.710> traveling<00:04:42.310> on<00:04:42.430> a

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
acceleration and also traveling on a

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.629 
acceleration and also traveling on a
motorway<00:04:42.850> if<00:04:43.330> one<00:04:43.510> was<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:44.020> overtake<00:04:44.889> say<00:04:45.610> a

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
motorway if one was to overtake say a

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.150 
motorway if one was to overtake say a
lorry<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.180> rain<00:04:46.650> wanted<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.710> hurry<00:04:47.889> pass

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
lorry in the rain wanted a hurry pass

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.030 
lorry in the rain wanted a hurry pass
and<00:04:48.460> get<00:04:48.580> past<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:50.350> just<00:04:50.560> doesn't<00:04:50.770> have

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
and get past that it just doesn't have

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.760 
and get past that it just doesn't have
meat<00:04:51.389> it's<00:04:52.389> really<00:04:52.990> struggling<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.560> get

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
meat it's really struggling to get

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.340 
meat it's really struggling to get
anywhere<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:55.300> my<00:04:55.570> advice<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:55.930> anybody

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
anywhere so my advice to anybody

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.460 
anywhere so my advice to anybody
thinking<00:04:56.770> about<00:04:56.979> buying<00:04:57.280> one<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.580> these<00:04:57.850> is

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
thinking about buying one of these is

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.500 
thinking about buying one of these is
you<00:04:59.470> certainly<00:04:59.919> don't<00:05:00.160> want<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.580> go<00:05:01.120> for<00:05:01.389> the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
you certainly don't want to go for the

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.050 
you certainly don't want to go for the
automatic<00:05:01.930> for<00:05:02.860> this<00:05:03.010> engine<00:05:03.250> size<00:05:03.669> because

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
automatic for this engine size because

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.779 
automatic for this engine size because
then<00:05:04.240> it's<00:05:04.360> going<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.660> be<00:05:04.810> more<00:05:05.140> underpowered

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
then it's going to be more underpowered

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.430 
then it's going to be more underpowered
it's<00:05:06.789> worthwhile<00:05:07.030> going<00:05:07.600> for<00:05:07.810> something<00:05:08.020> more

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
it's worthwhile going for something more

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.960 
it's worthwhile going for something more
talky<00:05:08.979> something<00:05:09.370> with<00:05:09.490> more<00:05:09.640> mid-range

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
talky something with more mid-range

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.779 
talky something with more mid-range
torque<00:05:10.690> especially<00:05:11.470> if<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.160> might<00:05:12.310> find<00:05:12.640> in

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
torque especially if you might find in

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.110 
torque especially if you might find in
the<00:05:12.880> diesel

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
the diesel

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.840 
the diesel
and<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.570> would<00:05:14.960> seriously<00:05:15.760> emphasize<00:05:16.760> that<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
and I would seriously emphasize that the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.290 
and I would seriously emphasize that the
necessity<00:05:19.850> for<00:05:19.880> a<00:05:20.210> larger<00:05:20.960> engine<00:05:22.120> would<00:05:23.120> be<00:05:23.150> a

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
necessity for a larger engine would be a

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.200 
necessity for a larger engine would be a
very<00:05:23.660> wise<00:05:23.780> choice<00:05:24.020> indeed<00:05:27.639> now<00:05:28.639> hopefully<00:05:28.910> I

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
very wise choice indeed now hopefully I

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.820 
very wise choice indeed now hopefully I
can<00:05:29.300> get<00:05:29.479> to<00:05:29.570> do<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:29.720> nought<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:30.020> sixty<00:05:30.410> tests<00:05:30.680> in

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
can get to do a nought to sixty tests in

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:43.140 
can get to do a nought to sixty tests in
the<00:05:30.889> moment<00:05:31.280> three<00:05:32.270> two<00:05:32.570> one

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.629 

and<00:05:43.600> that's<00:05:43.900> 60<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.530> mean<00:05:44.800> there's<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:45.190> perfect

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
and that's 60 I mean there's a perfect

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.210 
and that's 60 I mean there's a perfect
example<00:05:45.669> there's<00:05:46.419> a<00:05:46.479> loop<00:05:46.660> of<00:05:46.840> road<00:05:47.220> kill

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
example there's a loop of road kill

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.689 
example there's a loop of road kill
carriageway<00:05:48.880> it's<00:05:49.479> just<00:05:50.400> struggle<00:05:51.400> to<00:05:51.550> get

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
carriageway it's just struggle to get

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.760 
carriageway it's just struggle to get
there<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:52.540> you<00:05:53.080> want<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.290> go<00:05:53.380> for<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> bigger

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
there so you want to go for a bigger

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.680 
there so you want to go for a bigger
engine<00:05:54.040> don't<00:05:54.820> worry<00:05:55.000> about<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.270> socks<00:05:55.570> the

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
engine don't worry about the socks the

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.800 
engine don't worry about the socks the
socks<00:05:55.780> are<00:05:56.110> very<00:05:56.290> firm<00:05:57.780> unfortunately<00:05:58.780> I

can't tell you what this is like in the

can't tell you what this is like in the

wheel<00:06:11.440> drive<00:06:11.740> I<00:06:13.229> suspect<00:06:14.229> you're<00:06:14.410> going<00:06:14.440> to

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
wheel drive I suspect you're going to

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.400 
wheel drive I suspect you're going to
have<00:06:14.740> a<00:06:14.770> lot<00:06:14.979> of<00:06:15.100> understeer<00:06:15.669> but<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:17.110> torque

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
have a lot of understeer but the torque

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.710 
have a lot of understeer but the torque
steer<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.130> a<00:06:18.160> big<00:06:18.460> issue<00:06:18.639> I'm<00:06:19.300> coming<00:06:19.630> to

steer is a big issue I'm coming to

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.020 
steer is a big issue I'm coming to
around<00:06:19.960> about<00:06:20.289> now<00:06:20.650> and<00:06:21.520> I'm<00:06:21.669> just<00:06:21.820> going<00:06:21.970> to

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
around about now and I'm just going to

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.330 
around about now and I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:06:22.270> that<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:23.110> I<00:06:23.470> have<00:06:23.889> had<00:06:24.130> worse

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
demonstrate that to you I have had worse

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.620 
demonstrate that to you I have had worse
reflexive<00:06:25.680> steering's<00:06:27.090> but<00:06:28.090> let's<00:06:28.300> see<00:06:28.449> what

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
reflexive steering's but let's see what

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.040 
reflexive steering's but let's see what
this<00:06:28.750> one's<00:06:29.020> like<00:06:29.260> now<00:06:30.419> sometimes<00:06:31.419> they<00:06:31.690> joked

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
this one's like now sometimes they joked

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.620 
this one's like now sometimes they joked
back<00:06:32.350> to<00:06:32.979> straighten<00:06:33.430> up<00:06:33.550> so<00:06:33.789> aggressively

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
back to straighten up so aggressively

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.320 
back to straighten up so aggressively
that<00:06:34.930> it<00:06:35.080> I<00:06:35.580> think<00:06:36.580> it<00:06:36.669> could<00:06:36.850> be<00:06:36.970> a<00:06:37.000> serious

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
that it I think it could be a serious

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
that it I think it could be a serious
danger<00:06:37.889> around<00:06:38.889> the<00:06:39.039> roundabout<00:06:40.350> tolerating

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
danger around the roundabout tolerating

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.120 
danger around the roundabout tolerating
out<00:06:42.270> yeah<00:06:43.270> it's<00:06:43.810> a<00:06:44.169> little<00:06:44.289> bit<00:06:44.470> reflective

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
out yeah it's a little bit reflective

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.279 
out yeah it's a little bit reflective
there<00:06:45.400> so<00:06:46.270> that<00:06:46.419> could<00:06:46.600> be<00:06:46.630> an<00:06:46.810> issue<00:06:46.930> for<00:06:47.229> some

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
there so that could be an issue for some

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:48.960 
there so that could be an issue for some
people<00:06:47.470> and<00:06:47.979> you'd<00:06:48.099> want<00:06:48.250> to<00:06:48.340> keep<00:06:48.520> your<00:06:48.639> hands

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
people and you'd want to keep your hands

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.640 
people and you'd want to keep your hands
firmly<00:06:49.900> on<00:06:50.110> the<00:06:50.260> steering<00:06:50.620> wheel<00:06:50.800> because

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
firmly on the steering wheel because

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.960 
firmly on the steering wheel because
there<00:06:52.650> are<00:06:52.830> times<00:06:53.130> when<00:06:53.400> the<00:06:53.490> steering<00:06:53.700> wheel

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
there are times when the steering wheel

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.820 
there are times when the steering wheel
is<00:06:54.060> going<00:06:54.210> to<00:06:54.270> take<00:06:54.450> over<00:06:54.480> control<00:06:54.810> so<00:06:55.500> that<00:06:55.710> is

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
is going to take over control so that is

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.680 
is going to take over control so that is
an<00:06:55.980> issue<00:06:56.100> so<00:06:56.280> please<00:06:56.700> bear<00:06:56.940> that<00:06:57.120> in<00:06:57.240> mind

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
an issue so please bear that in mind

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.150 
an issue so please bear that in mind
especially<00:06:58.320> if<00:06:58.410> you're<00:06:58.500> not<00:06:58.590> too<00:06:58.770> keen<00:06:59.040> on

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
especially if you're not too keen on

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.700 
especially if you're not too keen on
front<00:06:59.430> wheel<00:06:59.580> drives<00:06:59.940> but<00:07:00.840> it<00:07:01.020> has<00:07:01.170> to<00:07:01.320> be<00:07:01.440> said

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
front wheel drives but it has to be said

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.710 
front wheel drives but it has to be said
this<00:07:02.220> vehicle<00:07:02.640> is<00:07:02.760> very<00:07:02.790> very<00:07:03.300> good<00:07:03.540> and<00:07:05.720> it's

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
this vehicle is very very good and it's

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.270 
this vehicle is very very good and it's
got<00:07:06.870> the<00:07:06.990> build<00:07:07.230> quality<00:07:07.440> it's<00:07:08.010> got<00:07:08.190> the

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
got the build quality it's got the

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.420 
got the build quality it's got the
drivability<00:07:09.200> it's<00:07:10.200> certainly<00:07:10.650> one<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.280> the

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
drivability it's certainly one of the

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.810 
drivability it's certainly one of the
best<00:07:11.610> ones<00:07:11.910> out<00:07:12.090> there<00:07:12.420> is<00:07:12.960> it<00:07:13.170> better<00:07:13.380> than<00:07:13.530> a

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
best ones out there is it better than a

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.480 
best ones out there is it better than a
small<00:07:14.820> BMW<00:07:15.570> BMW<00:07:15.840> 1-series<00:07:16.410> I'd<00:07:17.010> have<00:07:17.190> to<00:07:17.280> say

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
small BMW BMW 1-series I'd have to say

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.260 
small BMW BMW 1-series I'd have to say
no<00:07:17.730> is<00:07:18.600> it<00:07:18.810> better<00:07:18.990> than<00:07:19.050> a<00:07:19.170> Ford<00:07:19.470> Fiesta

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
no is it better than a Ford Fiesta

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:34.410 
no is it better than a Ford Fiesta
definitely<00:07:21.270> 100%

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420
