00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the top of my wheel how much the axle

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
the top of my wheel how much the axle
needs<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.189> go<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.119> axe<00:00:21.270> were<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> bottom

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
needs to go up if the axe were to bottom

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
needs to go up if the axe were to bottom
out<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.500> much<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:22.859> travel<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.730> when<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
out how much it would travel so when I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.730 
out how much it would travel so when I
make<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.300> wheel<00:00:24.510> well<00:00:24.720> I'll<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
make my wheel well I'll know what the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.349 
make my wheel well I'll know what the
height<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.099> needs<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> want<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
height that needs to be so I want to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.759 
height that needs to be so I want to
make<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.720> equalizer<00:00:28.109> bars<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
make sure my equalizer bars in the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
make sure my equalizer bars in the
correct<00:00:29.010> location<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.420> I'll<00:00:30.510> measure<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
correct location and I'll measure to the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
correct location and I'll measure to the
ground<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.740> got<00:00:31.890> 21<00:00:32.460> inches<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:33.570> also

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
ground and I got 21 inches I'm also

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
ground and I got 21 inches I'm also
going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> check<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> other<00:00:34.469> side<00:00:34.559> now<00:00:35.399> once<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
going to check the other side now once I

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.889 
going to check the other side now once I
put<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> weight<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
put a lot of weight on it it's going to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.430 
put a lot of weight on it it's going to
settle<00:00:37.200> down<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.870> it'll<00:00:39.870> probably<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
settle down and it'll probably be a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
settle down and it'll probably be a
little<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.800> shorter<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
little bit shorter than that but just in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.220 
little bit shorter than that but just in
case<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.410> 21<00:00:43.980> inches<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:45.230> my

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
case I'm going to go 21 inches as my my

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
case I'm going to go 21 inches as my my
height<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.760> axle<00:00:48.440> if<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
height for now now for my axle if it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.260 
height for now now for my axle if it
were<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> bottom<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.239> a

this<00:01:02.010> could<00:01:02.280> potentially<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> get

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this could potentially be so to get

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
this could potentially be so to get
ready<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> plywood<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> trailer<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:06.090> thing

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
highest point and set it up on posts I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
highest point and set it up on posts I
used<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.080> concrete<00:01:25.439> blocks<00:01:25.970> set<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.150> highest

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
used some concrete blocks set my highest

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.060 
used some concrete blocks set my highest
point<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.290> from<00:01:28.530> there<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> brought

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
point and then from there I brought

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819 
point and then from there I brought
everything<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> level<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.680> my

than<00:04:55.260> doing<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.860> with<00:04:56.660> polystyrene<00:04:57.660> foam

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
