is this structure then when you were at
HBO<00:00:06.560> um<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:08.040> know<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:10.070> when<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.099> was<00:00:11.219> at<00:00:11.340> HBO<00:00:11.700> in

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
HBO um you know I when I was at HBO in

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.419 
HBO um you know I when I was at HBO in
the<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.330> 90s<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the in the 90s and I think that was the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.760 
the in the 90s and I think that was the
golden<00:00:14.880> era<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.330> HBO<00:00:16.020> boxing<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.590> I'm<00:00:16.650> really

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
golden era of HBO boxing and I'm really

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.019 
golden era of HBO boxing and I'm really
proud<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.220> period<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.640> time<00:00:17.699> working

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
proud of that period of time working

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.269 
proud of that period of time working
with<00:00:18.210> Seth<00:00:18.480> Abraham<00:00:18.900> force<00:00:19.680> F<00:00:19.890> Abraham

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
with Seth Abraham force F Abraham

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.120 
with Seth Abraham force F Abraham
working<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.730> Russ<00:00:20.910> greenberg<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.570> think<00:00:21.900> we

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
working with Russ greenberg I think we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.769 
working with Russ greenberg I think we
over<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.760> period<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.150> time<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
over that period of time I think that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.400 
over that period of time I think that
was<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> golden<00:00:25.320> age<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:26.250> HBO<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
was a golden age for for HBO and and I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.169 
was a golden age for for HBO and and I
think<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.740> gave<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.429> public<00:00:29.760> some<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
think we gave the public some of the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
think we gave the public some of the
biggest<00:00:30.630> fights<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.199> biggest<00:00:31.470> events<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
biggest fights and biggest events and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.660 
biggest fights and biggest events and
our<00:00:33.390> ratings<00:00:33.750> reflected<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:35.250> think

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
our ratings reflected that I think

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.250 
our ratings reflected that I think
boxing's<00:00:36.059> become<00:00:36.329> more<00:00:36.510> marginalized<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
boxing's become more marginalized in the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.400 
boxing's become more marginalized in the
last<00:00:37.440> 15<00:00:37.770> years<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.190> certainly<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.760> grown<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
last 15 years it's certainly not grown I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
last 15 years it's certainly not grown I
think<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.800> opportunity<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.420> think

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
think this is an opportunity and I think

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.790 
think this is an opportunity and I think
it's<00:00:42.690> everything<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> Allah<00:00:43.290> north<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it's everything that Allah north to the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.900 
it's everything that Allah north to the
benefit<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> everybody<00:00:44.489> else<00:00:44.760> who's
