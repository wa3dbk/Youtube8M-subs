00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to be opened here's so it's really great

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.069 
to be opened here's so it's really great
it<00:00:33.809> does<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> really<00:00:34.170> good<00:00:34.530> job<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it does a really good job this is the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.619 
it does a really good job this is the
person<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:38.149> mess<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
person that I really mess with this and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.910 
person that I really mess with this and
start<00:00:39.840> dealing<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.739> haven't

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
start dealing with it because I haven't

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.700 
start dealing with it because I haven't
had<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> cheaper<00:00:41.700> version<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.350> thought<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> one

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
had a cheaper version I thought this one

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.139 
had a cheaper version I thought this one
would<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.950> better<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.910> tube

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
would be better just because this tube

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.510 
would be better just because this tube
here<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.420> slightly<00:00:46.200> thicker<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.370> many

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
here is slightly thicker has so many

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
here is slightly thicker has so many
adjustments<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.559> get<00:00:49.710> different

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
adjustments so you can get different

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.729 
adjustments so you can get different
heights<00:00:50.280> also<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.059> remove<00:00:51.500> I'm<00:00:52.500> sorry

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
heights also you can remove I'm sorry

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
heights also you can remove I'm sorry
you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.980> remove<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you can remove this right here and this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.220 
you can remove this right here and this
flat<00:00:55.820> will<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> sides<00:00:58.079> of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.160 
they're not going to be nice you know
they're<00:02:05.490> trying<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> bang<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.780> hit<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
they're trying to bang it and hit it and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
they're trying to bang it and hit it and
if<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.590> goes<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.550> believe<00:02:09.030> me<00:02:09.239> this

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
if this goes like this believe me this

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.810 
if this goes like this believe me this
we<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.200> fly<00:02:11.180> Canada<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.480> this

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
we just fly Canada now but this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.910 
we just fly Canada now but this
see<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.060> get<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:18.380> see<00:02:19.380> how<00:02:19.500> little<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.890> is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
see if I can get it see how little it is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740 
see if I can get it see how little it is
there<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:20.970> needs<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.390> bit<00:02:21.660> more

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
there it just needs a little bit more

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.090 
there it just needs a little bit more
and<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.770> gone<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> downside

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
and it it's gone so that is the downside

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.440 
and it it's gone so that is the downside
to<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:26.970> they<00:02:27.120> should<00:02:27.330> have

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to this I think that they should have

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.560 
to this I think that they should have
made<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.780> tube<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.350> slightly<00:02:29.220> thicker<00:02:29.910> so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
made this tube here slightly thicker so

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.030 
made this tube here slightly thicker so
it<00:02:30.630> wouldn't<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.260> much<00:02:31.410> plate<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it wouldn't have so much plate on the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.470 
it wouldn't have so much plate on the
inside<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.490> this<00:02:32.610> bigger<00:02:32.850> bigger<00:02:33.540> tube<00:02:33.950> and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
inside of this bigger bigger tube and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.150 
inside of this bigger bigger tube and
but<00:02:36.480> aside<00:02:36.690> from<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.930> disgusting<00:02:37.530> good<00:02:37.950> wait

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
but aside from that disgusting good wait

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.420 
but aside from that disgusting good wait
a<00:02:38.370> few<00:02:38.580> solid<00:02:38.910> feels<00:02:39.390> good<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.220> just

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
a few solid feels good but I just

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.890 
a few solid feels good but I just
noticed<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.850> little<00:02:42.000> downpour<00:02:42.330> here<00:02:42.750> this
