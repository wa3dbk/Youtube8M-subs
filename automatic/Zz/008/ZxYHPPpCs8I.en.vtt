00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
together with my hands and then just

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.969

coated<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.419> apples<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.959> crepe<00:04:21.410> after<00:04:21.950> I

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
coated the apples in crepe after I

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.790
