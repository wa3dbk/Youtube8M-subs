00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
was in it because it always used to go
out<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.820> time<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> pubs<00:02:00.509> were<00:02:00.659> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
out at a time when the pubs were just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.749 
out at a time when the pubs were just
opening<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.030> never<00:02:03.240> watched<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.780> because

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
opening and I never watched it because

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.190 
opening and I never watched it because
if<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.939> could<00:02:06.149> possibly<00:02:06.450> avoid<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
if I could possibly avoid it because I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.839 
if I could possibly avoid it because I
was<00:02:07.439> never<00:02:07.590> satisfied<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.160> actors<00:02:08.700> them

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
was never satisfied with actors them

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.010 
was never satisfied with actors them
they<00:02:09.090> liked<00:02:09.300> watching<00:02:09.479> them<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
they liked watching them because you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.300 
they liked watching them because you
always<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.440> did<00:02:10.590> another<00:02:10.800> take<00:02:11.069> would

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
always think we did another take would

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.670 
always think we did another take would
be<00:02:11.430> better<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:13.080> assumed

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
be better so I just assumed

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
be better so I just assumed
people<00:02:14.010> liked<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.670> left<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
people liked it I left it at that I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240 
people liked it I left it at that I

disenchanted with the way it was going
you<00:03:15.419> know<00:03:15.510> being<00:03:15.689> a<00:03:15.750> very<00:03:15.900> proprietorial<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you know being a very proprietorial and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.219 
you know being a very proprietorial and
I<00:03:17.549> thought<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.909> was<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.120> only<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.449> who<00:03:18.959> knew

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
I thought I was the only one who knew

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.809 
I thought I was the only one who knew
what<00:03:19.409> it<00:03:19.560> was<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.919> how<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.489> should<00:03:20.669> be<00:03:20.790> done

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
what it was like how it should be done

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.089 
what it was like how it should be done
that<00:03:21.299> inevitably<00:03:21.870> happens<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.620> became<00:03:22.919> too

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
that inevitably happens and I became too

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.819 
that inevitably happens and I became too
possessive<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:24.569> said<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.109> anyone<00:03:25.349> may<00:03:25.590> want

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
possessive and said if anyone may want

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.580 
possessive and said if anyone may want
to<00:03:25.889> make<00:03:26.069> any<00:03:26.280> changes<00:03:26.699> that<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:27.000> didn't<00:03:27.299> like

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
to make any changes that I didn't like

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.469 
to make any changes that I didn't like
this<00:03:28.590> used<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.889> upset<00:03:29.220> me<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.790> began<00:03:30.150> to

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
this used to upset me and so I began to

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.500 
this used to upset me and so I began to
think<00:03:30.689> I'd<00:03:31.379> rather<00:03:31.560> go<00:03:31.829> away<00:03:32.069> from<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.510> they

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
think I'd rather go away from this they

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.170 
think I'd rather go away from this they
didn't<00:03:33.780> decide<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.139> decided<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.849> how<00:03:35.970> would<00:03:36.030> you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
didn't decide I decided so how would you

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.670 
didn't decide I decided so how would you
describe<00:03:36.479> what<00:03:36.900> would<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.109> put<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.319> dent<00:03:37.530> at

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680
