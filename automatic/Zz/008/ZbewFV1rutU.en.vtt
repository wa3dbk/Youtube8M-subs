00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:15.969
 it was the relegation candidate too aggressive 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.220
 plays behind trying to admit anything 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.360
 At the beginning that was maybe one 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.670
 Little surprised by the way of playing 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.640
 innsbruck but then I think with 1 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.990
 1 0 and 2 0 then it was the game 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.279
 then actually more or less 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.199
 chosen because they have known 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.539
 We know our qualities 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.460
 where today our nationwide 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.200
 play out and think that that yourself 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.550
 then at the height this is earned 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.630
 result of course very very nice though 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.760
 that is also a lot of hard work 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.290
 behind it the great player is really 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.320
 viewed exactly he has noticed in the beginning 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.670
 It was not the yellow of the egg but you 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.770
 knows the fight and a descent of the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 we await its actual counterpart 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.110
 be cool and be patient and if 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.280
 also rewarded in the end 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 he was surprised about the formation of the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.190
 roland kirchler sent for more 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.680
 marino and sarah counted and but 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.850
 very strong players came and 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.530
 and get 20 minutes more time 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.130
 but because she because she is doing very well 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.840
 implemented 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.640
 utilities season so you have 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.520
 demanded everything from us 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.920
 yes and then we already have others 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.230
 Possibility but it is very very 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.000
 it has been difficult to be very concrete 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.340
 come in front of the gate and 100 in person 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.300
 play and then very different from one 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.010
 Studied situation with a standard 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.520
 free kick that the side then with the 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.790
 Guidance is a bit easier if you can 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 say good luck for one 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.909
 great combination on our side with 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.770
 the optical 2012 took place 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.310
 my heart that was awesome was a lot 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.990
 movement was in it 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.450
 A great combination was there 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.369
 there were many chances in and out 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.280
 what we the team in the summer 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.320
 have tried to vaccinate that if it 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.299
 opportunities and if we have one 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.799
 great are that we are permanently on time 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.830
 must continue to play chances and 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.880
 that's what the team has internalized 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.979
 really this season and that's why 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 you have then in the game not with 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.849
 Forced but really like that meets me 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.690
 or saturn and we have 4 0 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.510
 that is gratifying 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 he looks pretty much the same from the outside 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.540
 always there 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.519
 there is a lot of it and hard 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.870
 works behind everyone gives always 100 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.700
 percent each wants to be tribe member 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.580
 fight for and prove that he 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.870
 had the confidence that that 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 can go back and laugh 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.420
 simply because everyone is one hundred percent 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.739
 on the game concept we tried 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.280
 after the first one again 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.260
 drauflegen 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.060
 it may be easier than it is 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.500
 we succeeded what was very important 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.510
 is because the individual leadership is sage 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.110
 important but the 240 times some 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.420
 fancier I think at the latest 3 0 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.760
 was already at the 2 0 very good feeling 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.070
 head if you have seen our season 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.900
 Defenders how to play uncompromising 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.600
 and moved to let but little 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.730
 have got to gates until now yes 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.530
 therefore actually more or less big 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.609
 that as always if you do not consider them 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.269
 do stupid that one the game 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.940
 will win 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:16.269
 am somebody who always organization in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.280
 have sense dogs and you can say okay 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.780
 all because if I thought so 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.850
 and that's what it radiates 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.769
 how to fear the team have at 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.200
 careless what is rather rare 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.389
 but that happens really done 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.180
 that partie was 3 0 because of that 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:35.600
 but magath is very huge opportunities 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.819
 ok so a discussion finished 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.780
 After two games, the goal lulled today 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.730
 the madness 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.519
 So that's why it was cool there again 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 so a bit quiet and the third 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.609
 So then the decision has that 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.230
 was very enjoyable yes it was in 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.109
 the media maybe once so far 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.459
 theme which is nothing, or otherwise negative 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.329
 to write about us but have come 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.819
 I think that they are not in doubt 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.270
 Myself can be just like my teammates 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.950
 to entrust with it 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.020
 that we will have the chance again someday 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.520
 Get or ease Germany 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.560
 that the land of the knots burst again 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.770
 can and that was short today 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.770
 the case
