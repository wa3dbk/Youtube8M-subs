00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.899
 Do you want to try 120 minutes in one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.899
 to realize 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.089
 yes they were systems that competed against each other 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.890
 played 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.080
 i thought we had more quality as 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 Costa Rica 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 and I thought we were three pointers 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.019
 we could hurt more at one 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.179
 Costa Rica 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 well we have created many opportunities 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.700
 but we did n't hurt 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.090
 yes and then it is usually the team 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.370
 the odds also beast the penalties 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 lose what is with me through my 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 gone but yes that group is it 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 really amazing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.860
 so really the best group with which to work together 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.239
 have worked better than with one 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.230
 festering ajax in year in the sense of 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 team spirit and belief and conviction 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.299
 that is just so 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.390
 and when does he first notice it? 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.390
 to do 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.090
 Well though notes first week 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.740
 proof for speaking yes it sounds crazy 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.040
 but everyone who has been so also the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.259
 pro girls and poetry is in all that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 players who have called who have 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.439
 really great trained and it is alone 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.310
 but continue we have four 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.909
 boarding moments goes because it was then 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.640
 not the best preparation and we 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 also had to individualize 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 so that was also difficult of the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.229
 clarity one buildings other than 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.470
 the other 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.850
 yes and one and also did not come yet 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 fit players inside so yes it was 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.420
 actually incredible how fast this one 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.310
 group and how now the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
 conviction lives 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.100
 because indeed Wesley Shipp the way 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.460
 on which those penalties were taken that is 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.140
 really with a lot of conviction there 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.700
 all world how falls it is not 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.780
 so that we do not have much 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.450
 because I believe in the fact that if 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.220
 your shot automates it a lot 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.130
 easier 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.530
 and as long as you know that you are in it 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.209
 shoot if you know in advance then 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.390
 you can focus on that 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.090
 so they all did that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 and tim has it 2 degrees so better 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.370
 it doesn't 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 the radio report said hey according to mail 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 also tim curl hot you are movie 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.620
 has been hockey and has been handball leading 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.989
 me twenty eight 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.280
 Well just look who the best penalty 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.400
 killer is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.840
 and in our eyes that was curl and he 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.410
 also has a longer reach 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.810
 so so yes it has never happened on 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.680
 a wk the 15 years that but nothing came 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.410
 no no ok we realize I have 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.530
 true on purpose not with the jasper 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.140
 went through what we wanted him to be 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.230
 preparation later 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.459
 and tim well of course you must is too 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.269
 he keeps his mouth against jaspers too 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.709
 difficult hera 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.290
 anyway it's all your team 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.739
 interests it sometimes just packed another 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.750
 miraculous exile 117 minutes 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.540
 no, but jasper is just doing really bad 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.100
 well so there is no matter you at all 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.329
 next time to a goal 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.510
 that we jasper everyone also needs to 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.019
 know there is a difference in keeper 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.010
 and and for these penalties 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.650
 apparently tim pill 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.380
 better look afterwards it's nice and table 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.650
 nice but if it had ended differently 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.900
 was worn in weather for crazy but it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.880
 now comes out luckily you have it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.049
 idea that you describe so from me 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.220
 you are still becoming 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:57.070
 weighted by race I 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.750
 I don't care but that's how it goes 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.640
 it in football 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.530
 a good all spoke out well so far 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.110
 you can't complain everyone is fit too 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.200
 closely playing just fine I know 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.420
 not everything if it's about it 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.430
 possession have harder honor 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.370
 I like to have analytical skills 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.880
 what percentage of ball president 70% 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.320
 o no o no with such a defender 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.110
 devices went a bit more offensive now 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.150
 playing is just the same 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.560
 yesterday we are talking about argentina 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.400
 next Wednesday 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.930
 I know you don't know about it yet 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.970
 thought you will prepare your new one 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.080
 fit argentina but you know it 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.950
 something of it 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.470
 we are going in well I have the first one 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.920
 considering half that was today I believe 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.880
 yes between belgium and argentina 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:51.070
 yes i thought that belgium was actually better 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.870
 played coal but so massive 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.730
 because I call it a muscle car adv 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.370
 then you want to and then shoot here 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.650
 of course nice in yes but there 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:05.350
 you do a little gut feeling that is not 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.640
 something you do as a team and then was 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.490
 just had it against 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.810
 If you like Argentina then talk about it 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.300
 divide around 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.300
 system while you 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.430
 442 game plays by everyone 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.020
 later it has nothing to do with it 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.020
 is how you do that 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.009
 yes i think we have chances against that 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.020
 have it is what i see yourself one 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.430
 few good i'm going so now some 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.220
 watch matches or 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.430
 video der lee will do that too and then 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.440
 let's make a campaign plan and 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.120
 see me where ship is stranded best 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.610
 Spain have a reward final 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.050
 have ticked Argentina every time 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.389
 of lost in final 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.830
 I got him got a headset and then 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.539
 Germany teams are at once to 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.840
 she wrote that michael 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:54.629
 grain but which now sits watching 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.490
 you know you feel good everyone is 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:58.620
 everyone is good at fighting out 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.840
 appear and plain 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.879
 struggled with another mat lots 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.629
 trouble with the camp or yes 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.259
 fatigue 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.990
 clare's Flemish knee was locked 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.379
 we have to wait 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.629
 and for the rest I don't think they are 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.490
 all fatigue symptoms 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:21.360
 employable on Wednesday it is already that far again 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.810
 do you think i think i don't think so 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.919
 but the miracles are not out of the world 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.449
 I said it before the game 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.759
 objective was this but you are still 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.979
 not nearly satisfied 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.169
 no, the purpose of us is something else 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.680
 bullseye of the NFL that have achieved 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.779
 so I'm happy about that but we have 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.370
 a higher goal 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.539
 I wish you a lot of success and if 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.539
 congratulations thank you
