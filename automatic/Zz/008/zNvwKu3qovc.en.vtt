00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.520
 Hi, I'm Alejandra, they charge and you're in my 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.910
 house that is your house I have done so many 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.900
 marshmallow stuff I bought so many 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 marshmallows that suddenly one day I 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.010
 It made me think good and I could not do 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.860
 some marshmallows and well I've searched 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.200
 a lot of recipes I have tried 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.960
 some marshmallows and good if you 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.050
 I talk about how they left me all are their 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.540
 Rare everything everything everything has happened to me 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 done out there I'm seeing some 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.380
 but this recipe I think is very good 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.600
 I tried it, it worked, it worked 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.110
 well and well I want to share the first 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.900
 what we are going to do is hydrate two envelopes 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.730
 of grenetina in this case is a 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 grenadine that I bought in the super 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 remember that the gelatin is gelatin 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.200
 without flavor here we are going to put two envelopes 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.770
 the envelopes are 7 grams each if 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.330
 you're going to weigh 14 grams and nothing 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.510
 more you know we put it 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.790
 we leave it here and continue with the 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.910
 elaboration of marshmallows after 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 we are going to use two and a quarter cups here 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.070
 I already have measures we are going to put 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.110
 warm up and we're going to use corn syrup 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.300
 baby honey there are many brands this 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.540
 It is also carlota and there is honey 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.850
 expensive there are many brands and we will use 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:39.310
 a cup and a half of honey as you'll see 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.670
 it melted very well all the sugar 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.670
 and now let's see that it reaches the point 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.840
 highest thermometer 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.290
 we are with the 210 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.159
 fahrenheit 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.340
 in the 100 degrees centigrade 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:11.100
 and that means that the point of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.410
 this honey and I will keep moving 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.280
 and you remember the argentina- 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.990
 we had around there I'm going to incorporate 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 while boiling we are going to paint a 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.860
 bit 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.290
 a couple of drops of this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.250
 to everything that was the boil we are going to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.550
 pay we have our clear to point 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.550
 of nougat 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.920
 we're going to beat this mixture so 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.650
 less about 15 or 20 minutes for 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.860
 Thicken very well and then I'm going to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.129
 while I'm showing you how you're going to 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:59.909
 prepare the corn starch in the mold 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.909
 so you have your mothers ready 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.350
 the point is already adequate and I'm going to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.410
 say because I know the point is 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:35.430
 suitable very carefully 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:37.890
 look, do not fall, it's amazing, super 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.290
 super nice this is the point that should 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.930
 to take I put a little bit more 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.790
 painting because I felt very white and 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.790
 then now let's pay it 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.770
 ok our sleeve is already ready and what 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.530
 you're going to do is you're going to put it together and you're going 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.310
 to give as well as that the vueltita so that 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.090
 do not get out above that's very very 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.700
 important and then we are already and now 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.270
 ladies and gentlemen the moment of the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.270
 true 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.050
 connects 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.570
 and this one that is left later only 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 short 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:43.040
 Well, this recipe is going to give you 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.410
 for two trays right now we put the 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.360
 half in this and what we're going to do is 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.710
 that we are going to leave them in a cool place 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.130
 for they rest and dry overnight and 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.630
 tomorrow we will see how it is then now if 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.270
 it's already happened the day you love 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.030
 that we made the marshmallows right now 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.710
 I'm shaking them because with this 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.640
 the cornstarch have a lot of cornstarch 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.680
 this turned out to be a very successful recipe I 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.140
 I invite you if you want to see the step to 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.910
 step if you missed something if in the video 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.220
 you did not understand it, something that 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.880
 you look for in a blog we are going to put it there 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.850
 detailed the recipe but it was very 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.430
 father here we already have some of 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.500
 they cut I'm going to cut you again 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.670
 this so that you see it remember 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.330
 we deserve and we cut it has this 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.400
 So fluffy cloud texture are not 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.260
 same as the commercial ones 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.410
 I imagine that it will be producing the 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.870
 diffusion is a friend or something no no 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.540
 They are just as fluffy but they are 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.020
 incredibly rich 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.660
 You can do this in the ways that 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.940
 want me after we're going to exterminate and 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.730
 experiment with some strike molds 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.610
 I'm already thinking but well this is 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.160
 the basic to make 11 records if you 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.680
