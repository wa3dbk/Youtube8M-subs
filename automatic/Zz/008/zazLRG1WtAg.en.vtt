00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I tried um it was not the best concealer

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.690 
I tried um it was not the best concealer
I've<00:00:36.000> used<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> dryer<00:00:37.559> consistency<00:00:38.430> and

it's<00:00:38.879> definitely<00:00:39.780> full<00:00:40.230> coverage<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:41.399> you

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it's definitely full coverage so if you

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.779 
it's definitely full coverage so if you
have<00:00:42.170> deep<00:00:43.170> bags<00:00:43.440> under<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.770> eyes<00:00:43.860> this
