00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.839
 Hello, this is a short informational 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.670
 video primarily for those who know 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.580
 I have long been introduced 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.460
 I see no point in me pretty 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.980
 often ask in youtube comments 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.140
 and where did the project go r2 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.750
 I'll say right away that this was not my project 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.220
 it was a customer order by the way 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.800
 the client who brought me the cake 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 27 honda with 139 motor can look 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.090
 and those who have not seen me turn 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.520
 taking advantage of the moment did 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.700
 blanks for your engine like 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.379
 type and in order to be wrong 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.980
 sad to know that you are 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.629
 runner 2 will not see in the work I want 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.500
 say that for myself in particular, I collected 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.000
 I want to set a two-cylinder cylinder 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.219
 say that for myself, I gathered here 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.190
 kit for two-cylinder engine on 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.780
 the basis of the long menore whether it will be 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.089
 perhaps more interesting because he himself 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.119
 engine more modern and already a lot 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.320
 Once who practiced only I did 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.600
 maximum budget did not 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.369
 bother with all sorts of machines at chip 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.220
 I was the old block 3 Kigi 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.400
 he ideally repeats the form 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.460
 crankcase and all adjacent planes 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.110
 so I took as you can see from the left 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.130
 half cut off most of where 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.780
 CVT was frezer well exactly the same 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.759
 way took the right half 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.390
 cut off all unnecessary and argon from it 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.950
 welded if strain your eyesight then 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.680
 principle you can see a couple of points 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.960
 Of course the design is still pretty 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.460
 flimsy raw well in essence 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 principle therefore still requires 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.600
 multiple improvements but in general 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.909
 touched already big in this regard I confess 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.840
 honestly that freak show in the first 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.649
 turn the principle of articulation 2 crankshafts 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.939
 but since in principle the idea is not 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.530
 promising for serial 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.890
 production therefore do not see much 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.049
 sense of hiding the principle of articulation 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.119
 Crankshafts as you see internal 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.119
 hexagon but i think what else 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.150
 connection it will have to be finalized i 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.790
 I think that will have to additionally 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.790
 top of the clutch well and of course 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.190
 inside you will be here at 1 and 2 Colin 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.580
 shoot hex 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.800
 high alloy steels 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.190
 although I still do not know, in principle, it will be necessary with 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.730
 metal Vedas consult such here 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.410
 thing i think sometime i'm up to it 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.820
 I'll get it because you understand me now 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.850
 slightly different priorities 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.950
 I bought myself a garage in the garage 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.480
 normal unlike this halabuda in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.730
 which I already long ago and am learning and and 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.820
 I'm not working here very much 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.500
 arranges in terms of this you have seen everything 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.510
 It seems much just what is really 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.640
 business and many who came to me for 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.500
 dating who saw my videos later 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.270
 wanted to see live wondered how 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.390
 I fit here so much in principle 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.200
 especially tell anything is the main thing that 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.810
 I wanted to voice 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.790
 maybe a couple more videos 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.980
 come out of this garage because there is still 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.020
 not quite ready but subsequent videos 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.310
 but we will be shooting in a new room 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:23.120
 in a new workshop 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.489
 and this is by the way pinscher 2 already after 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.590
 our experiment with alexander 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.830
 miller thing was pretty 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.680
 popular and we are now slowly 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.860
 small-scale we produce frames for it 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.860
 So it goes
