oh<00:00:01.070> here<00:00:02.070> first

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.100 

has<00:00:06.359> an<00:00:06.540> old<00:00:06.720> brown<00:00:07.049> River<00:00:07.410> Mine<00:00:07.710> spreader<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
has an old brown River Mine spreader and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.450 
has an old brown River Mine spreader and
basically<00:00:10.110> all<00:00:10.350> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.770> a<00:00:10.799> 90-degree<00:00:11.670> here

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580 

so<00:00:14.850> that<00:00:15.030> can<00:00:15.300> switch<00:00:15.630> from<00:00:15.660> horizontal<00:00:16.200> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
so that can switch from horizontal to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.550 
so that can switch from horizontal to
vertical<00:00:17.330> then<00:00:18.330> inside<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> pair<00:00:19.410> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
vertical then inside is a pair of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.900 
vertical then inside is a pair of
homemade<00:00:20.330> 12<00:00:21.330> inch<00:00:21.540> diameter<00:00:22.520> for<00:00:23.520> granted

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
homemade 12 inch diameter for granted

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.880 
homemade 12 inch diameter for granted
millstones<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:25.380> i<00:00:25.410> need<00:00:26.450> there's<00:00:27.450> a<00:00:27.890> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
millstones that i need there's a the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.920 
millstones that i need there's a the
bottom<00:00:29.250> millstone<00:00:29.730> turns<00:00:30.090> from<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> shaft

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
bottom millstone turns from the shaft

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.000 
bottom millstone turns from the shaft
and<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:32.189> supported<00:00:32.790> underneath<00:00:33.210> by<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:34.010> throw

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and it's supported underneath by a throw

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
and it's supported underneath by a throw
out<00:00:35.100> bearing<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.940> 35<00:00:36.360> massey<00:00:36.840> ferguson

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
out bearing from a 35 massey ferguson

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.590 
out bearing from a 35 massey ferguson
tractor<00:00:37.800> that's<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.579> that's<00:00:38.880> basically<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
tractor that's what that's basically the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
tractor that's what that's basically the
thrust<00:00:40.020> bearing<00:00:40.140> underneath<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.880> then

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
thrust bearing underneath it and then

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
thrust bearing underneath it and then
there's<00:00:42.270> three<00:00:42.770> adjusting<00:00:43.770> screws<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.309> top

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
there's three adjusting screws on top

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.810 
there's three adjusting screws on top
that<00:00:44.880> puts<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> top<00:00:45.480> millstone<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that puts the top millstone down so the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.590 
that puts the top millstone down so the
top<00:00:48.120> millstone<00:00:48.690> sits<00:00:50.359> stationary<00:00:51.359> and<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
top millstone sits stationary and the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
top millstone sits stationary and the
bottom<00:00:51.960> millstone<00:00:52.469> turns<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.280> pedal

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
bottom millstone turns with my pedal

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.169 
bottom millstone turns with my pedal
power<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.989> flower<00:00:55.640> drops<00:00:56.640> off<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
power and the flower drops off the

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.579 
power and the flower drops off the
millstone<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> bottom<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
millstone into the bottom of the

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.079 
millstone into the bottom of the
stainless<00:00:59.100> steel<00:00:59.129> container<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> then

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
stainless steel container and then

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.540 
stainless steel container and then
there's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> rubber<00:01:01.350> panel<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.100> attached

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
there's a rubber panel that's attached

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's a rubber panel that's attached
to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> bottom<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> bottom<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.510> milk

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
to the bottom the bottom of the milk

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
to the bottom the bottom of the milk
bottle<00:01:06.930> turned<00:01:07.200> out

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.959 

you<00:01:12.359> see<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.100> here's<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> rubber<00:01:14.490> paddle

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
you see that here's the rubber paddle

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.840 
you see that here's the rubber paddle
that<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.899> catches<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> flower<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.549> drops

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that that catches the flower that drops

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520 
that that catches the flower that drops
down<00:01:17.969> below<00:01:18.359> and<00:01:18.509> sweeps<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
down below and sweeps it around and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.520 
down below and sweeps it around and
drops<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.969> hole<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.439> go

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
drops it into a hole and so it can go

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.999 
drops it into a hole and so it can go
into<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> container<00:01:23.159> outside<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
into a container outside and then the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
into a container outside and then the
exercise<00:01:26.549> machine<00:01:26.819> is<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.450> something<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.959> got

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
exercise machine is just something I got

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.849 
exercise machine is just something I got
at<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.409> dumpster<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:30.349> the<00:01:31.349> main<00:01:31.560> thing<00:01:31.829> is

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
at the dumpster and the main thing is

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.980 
at the dumpster and the main thing is
the<00:01:32.189> flywheel<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.030> originally<00:01:33.539> had<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.719> rap

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the flywheel was originally had a rap

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.160 
the flywheel was originally had a rap
sit<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.429> that<00:01:35.459> would<00:01:36.329> continue<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.959> spin

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
sit on it so that would continue to spin

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
sit on it so that would continue to spin
when<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.530> stop<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.130> pedals<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> wanted<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
when you stop the pedals but I wanted to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
when you stop the pedals but I wanted to
actually<00:01:39.959> have<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> flywheel<00:01:41.069> on<00:01:41.099> it<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
actually have the flywheel on it to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.029 
actually have the flywheel on it to
smooth<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.929> whole<00:01:43.109> thing<00:01:43.409> otherwise<00:01:43.859> you

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
smooth out the whole thing otherwise you

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.619 
smooth out the whole thing otherwise you
get<00:01:44.159> jerkiness<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.819> took<00:01:47.819> the<00:01:48.000> ratchet<00:01:48.479> off

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:48.629 
get jerkiness so I took the ratchet off

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.990 
get jerkiness so I took the ratchet off
of<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.959> and<00:01:49.079> moderate<00:01:49.530> solid<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.549> so

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
of it and moderate solid so that it so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600 
of it and moderate solid so that it so
that's<00:01:51.209> it<00:01:51.619> actually<00:01:52.619> helps<00:01:52.890> pull<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.429> I<00:01:53.579> go

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that's it actually helps pull it as I go

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.089 
that's it actually helps pull it as I go
back<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.149> forth<00:01:54.239> it<00:01:54.629> dips<00:01:54.959> it<00:01:55.679> makes<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
back and forth it dips it makes the

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.459 
back and forth it dips it makes the
whole<00:01:56.250> system<00:01:56.610> work<00:01:57.030> smooth<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.929> like<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.170> fly

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
whole system work smooth just like a fly

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.969 
whole system work smooth just like a fly
we<00:01:58.679> are<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.069> gasoline<00:02:00.030> engine<00:02:00.209> or<00:02:00.539> whatever

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
we are at a gasoline engine or whatever

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.419 
we are at a gasoline engine or whatever
so<00:02:01.979> originally<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.969> ratchet<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
so originally this was a ratchet so that

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.039 
so originally this was a ratchet so that
when<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.670> stopped<00:02:05.969> peddling<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.840> would

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
when you stopped peddling this would

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930 
when you stopped peddling this would
continue<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> spin<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> made<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.609> so<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
continue to spin but I made it so that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
continue to spin but I made it so that
it's<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:10.019> locked<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.220> solid<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it's actually locked in solid and that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.330 
it's actually locked in solid and that
way<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.329> helps<00:02:12.569> smooth<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.890> whole<00:02:14.040> thing

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
way it helps smooth out the whole thing

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:25.290 
way it helps smooth out the whole thing
and<00:02:14.370> makes<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.120> easier<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.629> tell

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.060 

at<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.630> rate<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.830> probably
