tuner and the reason to set your

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.490 
tuner and the reason to set your

intonation is if you have tuned at the

high or down low and it seems out of

tune everywhere but where you tuned that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
tune everywhere but where you tuned that
is<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.000> reason<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> set<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:42.899> intonation<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
is a reason to set your intonation and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.220 
is a reason to set your intonation and
the<00:00:43.680> most<00:00:43.860> common<00:00:44.219> reason<00:00:44.809> what<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the most common reason what you do to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
the most common reason what you do to
set<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.500> intonation<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> move<00:00:47.520> these

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
set your intonation is you move these

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.810 
set your intonation is you move these
saddle<00:00:48.239> pieces<00:00:48.690> via<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:50.160> screws<00:00:50.550> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
saddle pieces via the little screws on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.229 
saddle pieces via the little screws on
the<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.390> bridge<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.910> these<00:00:53.910> saddle

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the back of your bridge and these saddle

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.569 
the back of your bridge and these saddle
pieces<00:00:54.600> determine<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> string<00:00:55.410> length<00:00:55.710> if

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pieces determine the string length if

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.779 
pieces determine the string length if
your<00:00:57.230> string<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.440> too<00:00:58.680> short<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.609> will

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
your string is too short what will

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
your string is too short what will
happen<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> it'll<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.690> sharp<00:01:01.020> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> 12th

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
happen is it'll be sharp at the 12th

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.319 
happen is it'll be sharp at the 12th
fret<00:01:01.559> which<00:01:02.489> means<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> move<00:01:03.270> your

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
fret which means you need to move your

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.190 
fret which means you need to move your
saddle<00:01:03.750> piece<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.869> your<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
saddle piece back this way if your and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.179 
saddle piece back this way if your and
vice<00:01:07.740> versa

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
vice versa

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
vice versa
I'm<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.060> gonna<00:01:09.210> explain<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
I'm not gonna explain it all we have a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
I'm not gonna explain it all we have a
very<00:01:10.439> short<00:01:10.799> amount<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.100> time<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> need

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
very short amount of time what you need

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.649 
very short amount of time what you need
to<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.640> moving<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.970> put<00:01:15.330> stress

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to know is that moving these put stress

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.230 
to know is that moving these put stress
on<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.930> strings<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.430> should<00:01:17.880> tune<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
on your strings so you should tune it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.600 
on your strings so you should tune it
way<00:01:18.509> down<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.619> let's<00:01:19.890> prove<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
way down well first let's prove that the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.840 
way down well first let's prove that the
string<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.600> intonation<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.580> have<00:01:23.580> tuned

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
string is out of intonation I have tuned

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.170 
string is out of intonation I have tuned
it<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:25.979> e<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.850> play<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it it is a good e but then I play the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.980 
it it is a good e but then I play the
12th<00:01:27.270> fret<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:30.090> tuner<00:01:30.420> shows<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.810> it's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
12th fret and the tuner shows that it's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.679 
12th fret and the tuner shows that it's
sharp<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:32.130> barely<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.880> sharp<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.689> what

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
sharp just barely but sharp and so what

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.420 
sharp just barely but sharp and so what
I<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.710> string<00:01:38.070> length

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I need to do is make my string length

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.399 
I need to do is make my string length
longer<00:01:39.170> I'm<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> tune<00:01:40.829> my<00:01:41.549> string<00:01:41.909> down

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
longer I'm going to tune my string down

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
longer I'm going to tune my string down
to<00:01:43.409> take<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> stress<00:01:44.009> off<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:47.720> turn<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to take the stress off of it turn the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
to take the stress off of it turn the
tuner<00:01:49.110> off<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.530> move<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.549> saddle<00:01:50.880> piece

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
tuner off and move this saddle piece

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.520 
tuner off and move this saddle piece
this<00:01:51.299> way<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.810> make<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> string<00:01:52.320> length

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this way to make the string length

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.959 
this way to make the string length
longer<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.810> way<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.340> screwing

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
longer the way I do that is by screwing

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.490 
longer the way I do that is by screwing
in<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.750> screw<00:01:58.259> clockwise<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.079> move<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
in this screw clockwise and move it just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.310 
in this screw clockwise and move it just
a<00:02:01.770> short<00:02:02.040> distance<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:03.990> small

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
a short distance you want to make small

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.320 
a short distance you want to make small
changes<00:02:05.840> turn<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> tuner<00:02:07.200> back<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:08.179> tune<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
changes turn the tuner back on tune it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.540 
changes turn the tuner back on tune it
back<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.989> E

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.920 

now<00:02:18.550> let's<00:02:18.790> check<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.060> 12th<00:02:19.390> fret<00:02:19.540> again
