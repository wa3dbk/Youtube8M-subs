00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
last definitely when I started writing I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920 
last definitely when I started writing I
can<00:01:55.409> never<00:01:55.680> ever<00:01:55.950> remember<00:01:56.430> seeing<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.670> boy<00:01:56.930> now

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I've written and obviously this book is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.960 
I've written and obviously this book is
obviously<00:02:03.690> big<00:02:04.130> they're<00:02:05.130> also<00:02:05.280> picking<00:02:05.760> me<00:02:05.850> in

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
obviously big they're also picking me in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
when the helmets I'm starting forced to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.950 

since<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.570> obviously<00:02:20.990> absorbs<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:22.960> it

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
since a to obviously absorbs all for it
