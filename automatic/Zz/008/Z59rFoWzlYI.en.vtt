00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:04.109
 the trenitalia a 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 game 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.600
 farm fear if a good day 7 invalid seems 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.260
 in the municipality of falerna 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.800
 just over three kilometers my husband and I have a farm 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.229
 the paolazzi farmhouse 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.519
 today I present a very easy recipe but above all very fresh for 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.570
 the summer 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.650
 first of all we use our products 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.770
 and the trout and how you see trout fillets 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 and that are explained the evening before put under scratch you know that in the mail 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.310
 it looks typical and you too 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.250
 grappa production as well as wine production 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.280
 then 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 you can put a normal grappa of ischia but how can it also be one 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.720
 of yellow muscat you leave it all night naturally under grappa ours 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.320
 bodies I recommend with the skin upwards otherwise it risks drying out 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.540
 after that if we need parsley naturally 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.800
 of the lemon juice of the excellent extra virgin olive oil now we do nothing else 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.200
 than to take the fresh trot chick marinated all night. as I have 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.930
 said in the grappa 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.870
 resting on the cutting board 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.610
 brooch year 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.860
 as we normally do 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 asses indeed 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.720
 it will be raw fish 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.190
 and we value it 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.550
 on a plate 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 of scope 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.550
 fillet piece by piece 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.729
 being careful to make small pieces 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.599
 is 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.360
 to respect the fact that they are not there 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.090
 denis that inside me when I redeem it I paid attention but for whom 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.209
 it is not practical 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 comfort and also buy naturally 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.089
 the fillets of Trentino trout that are already found waste 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.089
 a little bit of slightly flavored rooms 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.629
 of lemon juice 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 as we said the extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.149
 and naturally 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:56.439
 of parsley 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.450
 the dish is ready therefore good appetite from the val di zena 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.399
 he trenitalia with 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.849
