00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.699 

so<00:00:12.330> first<00:00:12.629> I'm<00:00:12.900> going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> demonstrate<00:00:13.230> using

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
so first I'm going to demonstrate using

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.919 
so first I'm going to demonstrate using
the<00:00:14.280> stick<00:00:14.669> and<00:00:14.969> you're<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.419> to<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:15.660> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the stick and you're going to see that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.400 
the stick and you're going to see that
everything<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.800> divided<00:00:17.310> into<00:00:17.670> twos<00:00:18.560> 1<00:00:19.560> 2<00:00:19.880> 3<00:00:20.880> 4

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
everything is divided into twos 1 2 3 4

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:33.440 
everything is divided into twos 1 2 3 4
5<00:00:22.410> 6<00:00:22.919> 7<00:00:23.910> 8<00:00:24.239> 9<00:00:24.770> 10<00:00:25.770> 11<00:00:26.180> 12

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:53.940 

you

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.760 

you

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.950 

you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.420 

so<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.860> concentrate<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
so we're gonna concentrate on the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.010 
so we're gonna concentrate on the
first<00:01:09.550> four<00:01:09.880> movements<00:01:10.210> because<00:01:10.870> they're

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
first four movements because they're

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.560 
first four movements because they're
kind<00:01:11.230> of<00:01:11.350> similar<00:01:11.860> okay<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:12.580> goes<00:01:12.850> one<00:01:13.270> two

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
kind of similar okay so goes one two

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.040 
kind of similar okay so goes one two
three<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.590> four<00:01:15.010> okay<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:16.660> first<00:01:16.900> thing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
three and four okay the first thing

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.230 
three and four okay the first thing
that's<00:01:17.350> going<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.740> here<00:01:17.800> is<00:01:18.310> just<00:01:18.370> a<00:01:18.820> strategy

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
that's going on here is just a strategy

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.930 
that's going on here is just a strategy
of<00:01:19.720> attacking<00:01:20.380> high<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.250> then<00:01:21.640> immediately

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
of attacking high and then immediately

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.510 
of attacking high and then immediately
low<00:01:22.510> this<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:23.020> an<00:01:23.170> excellent<00:01:23.680> strategy<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
low this is an excellent strategy so

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
low this is an excellent strategy so
that's<00:01:24.700> number<00:01:24.940> one

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
that's number one

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.870 
that's number one
okay<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.320> second<00:01:26.770> thing<00:01:26.800> that's<00:01:27.340> going<00:01:27.760> on

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
okay the second thing that's going on

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.680 
okay the second thing that's going on
here<00:01:27.940> is<00:01:28.860> we're<00:01:29.860> going<00:01:30.010> from<00:01:30.250> here<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.210> here

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
here is we're going from here to here

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.370 
here is we're going from here to here
using<00:01:32.680> momentum<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:34.000> instead<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.510> using<00:01:34.960> just

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
using momentum so instead of using just

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.840 
using momentum so instead of using just
pure<00:01:36.190> muscle

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
pure muscle

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.420 
pure muscle
to<00:01:37.420> go<00:01:37.570> from<00:01:37.810> point<00:01:38.020> A<00:01:38.260> to<00:01:38.290> point<00:01:38.440> B<00:01:38.710> we're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
to go from point A to point B we're

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.940 
to go from point A to point B we're
actually<00:01:39.610> using<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.360> rebound<00:01:40.840> okay<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:41.560> there

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
actually using a rebound okay so there

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.150 
actually using a rebound okay so there
is<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.399> momentum<00:01:43.330> going<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.710> help<00:01:44.950> you

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
is this momentum going on to help you

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.540 
is this momentum going on to help you
transition<00:01:45.580> faster<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.860> that's<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.160> second

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
transition faster so that's the second

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.990 
transition faster so that's the second
thing

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
thing

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.749 
thing
the<00:01:49.930> third<00:01:50.320> thing<00:01:50.619> that's<00:01:50.950> going<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.490> is

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
the third thing that's going on is

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.359 
the third thing that's going on is
actually<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:53.080> is<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.350> first<00:01:53.800> motion<00:01:54.250> right

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
actually this is the first motion right

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.540 
actually this is the first motion right
here<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.880> not<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.600> slash<00:01:56.110> which<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.070> kind<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.430> a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
here is not a slash which is kind of a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.910 
here is not a slash which is kind of a
long<00:01:57.820> movement<00:01:58.570> like<00:01:58.690> this<00:01:58.899> it's<00:01:59.170> not<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.470> slash

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
long movement like this it's not a slash

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.600 
long movement like this it's not a slash
and<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:01.630> not<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:02.229> stab<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:03.009> actually<00:02:03.369> combines

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and it's not a stab it actually combines

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.210 
and it's not a stab it actually combines
them<00:02:04.509> both<00:02:04.810> together<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.560> when<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.009> combine

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
them both together and when you combine

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.400 
them both together and when you combine
a<00:02:06.399> slash<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.119> stab<00:02:07.360> together<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.990> get<00:02:08.170> a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
a slash and a stab together you get a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.710 
a slash and a stab together you get a
hack<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.520> more<00:02:09.640> like<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.850> chopping<00:02:10.509> motion

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
hack so it's more like a chopping motion

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.949 
hack so it's more like a chopping motion
right<00:02:11.410> here<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.220> you're<00:02:12.340> going<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.550> shop<00:02:13.180> right

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
right here so you're going to shop right

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.350 
right here so you're going to shop right
there<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.530> then<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.580> second<00:02:15.970> motion<00:02:16.090> right

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
there and then the second motion right

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.650 
there and then the second motion right
here<00:02:17.070> comes<00:02:18.070> in<00:02:18.340> after<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.820> chop<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.510> a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
here comes in after that chop so it's a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.000 
here comes in after that chop so it's a
a<00:02:19.870> real<00:02:20.440> deep<00:02:20.830> hack<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> next

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
a real deep hack and then the next

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.180 
a real deep hack and then the next
motion<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.519> circular<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.780> C<00:02:26.200> motion

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
motion is a circular it's a C motion

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.610 
motion is a circular it's a C motion
coming<00:02:27.459> down<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.810> cut<00:02:29.549> Y<00:02:30.549> now<00:02:31.420> what<00:02:32.230> makes<00:02:32.440> this

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
coming down to cut Y now what makes this

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.449 
coming down to cut Y now what makes this
so<00:02:32.860> great<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:34.830> you're<00:02:35.830> coming<00:02:36.100> in<00:02:36.310> right

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
so great is if you're coming in right

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.860 
so great is if you're coming in right
here<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.910> course<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.570> said<00:02:37.750> this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
here and of course it's like I said this

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.580 
here and of course it's like I said this
is<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.080> very<00:02:38.200> deep<00:02:39.420> pronounced<00:02:40.420> cut<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.290> attack

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
is a very deep pronounced cut the attack

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.310 
is a very deep pronounced cut the attack
itself<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.190> very<00:02:42.459> powerful<00:02:42.820> okay<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.080> type<00:02:44.290> of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
itself is very powerful okay the type of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.650 
itself is very powerful okay the type of
mark<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.100> should<00:02:45.310> leave<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.480> gonna

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
mark that it should leave is it's gonna

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.690 
mark that it should leave is it's gonna
be<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> line<00:02:47.260> kind<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.830> like<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> slash<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.580> not

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
be a line kind of like a slash but not

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.759 
be a line kind of like a slash but not
super<00:02:49.150> long<00:02:49.299> like<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> full<00:02:49.989> slash<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.620> it's

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
super long like a full slash but it's

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.039 
super long like a full slash but it's
gonna<00:02:50.950> be<00:02:51.040> probably<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.120> line<00:02:52.360> about<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:52.780> big

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
gonna be probably a line about this big

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.830 
gonna be probably a line about this big
this<00:02:53.739> long<00:02:54.070> but<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:54.820> gonna<00:02:54.940> be<00:02:55.120> very<00:02:55.450> deep

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
this long but it's gonna be very deep

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.410 
this long but it's gonna be very deep
almost<00:02:56.170> like<00:02:56.380> get<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.769> stab<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:58.180> know<00:02:58.269> this

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
almost like get a stab so you know this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.780 
almost like get a stab so you know this
parts<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:58.780> gonna<00:02:58.989> dig<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.440> really<00:03:00.040> big<00:03:00.459> okay

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
parts just gonna dig in really big okay

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.259 
parts just gonna dig in really big okay
and<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:01.660> motion<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:03.160> from<00:03:03.549> where<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.910> stops

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
and that motion that from where it stops

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.650 
and that motion that from where it stops
to<00:03:05.260> coming<00:03:05.739> out<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.880> immediately<00:03:07.390> go<00:03:07.630> to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
to coming out and you immediately go to

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.300 
to coming out and you immediately go to
the<00:03:07.930> circular<00:03:08.530> stat<00:03:08.829> slash<00:03:09.340> going<00:03:10.329> on<00:03:10.480> is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the circular stat slash going on is

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.000 
the circular stat slash going on is
gonna<00:03:12.310> make<00:03:12.579> your<00:03:12.850> motion<00:03:13.440> body<00:03:14.440> mechanic

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
gonna make your motion body mechanic

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.940 
gonna make your motion body mechanic
wise<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:16.390> efficient<00:03:16.959> but<00:03:17.320> on<00:03:17.440> top<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.859> that

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
wise really efficient but on top of that

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.460 
wise really efficient but on top of that
like<00:03:18.250> if<00:03:18.519> for<00:03:19.030> let's<00:03:19.570> say<00:03:19.720> some<00:03:19.959> reason<00:03:20.290> they

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
like if for let's say some reason they

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.520 
like if for let's say some reason they
grab

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
grab

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.670 
grab
your<00:03:22.220> wrist<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.209> if<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:24.020> happens<00:03:24.470> for

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
your wrist so if that happens for

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.030 
your wrist so if that happens for
whatever<00:03:24.890> reason<00:03:25.459> okay<00:03:25.910> then<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:27.319> circular

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
whatever reason okay then this circular

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.760 
whatever reason okay then this circular
cut<00:03:28.910> motion<00:03:29.450> which<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.870> number<00:03:30.080> two<00:03:30.440> is

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
cut motion which is number two is

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.160 
cut motion which is number two is
connected<00:03:31.640> with<00:03:31.790> number<00:03:32.150> one<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:32.930> you're

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
connected with number one so you're

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.199 
connected with number one so you're
already<00:03:33.410> countering<00:03:34.340> you're<00:03:34.550> already<00:03:34.850> making

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
already countering you're already making

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.720 
already countering you're already making
it<00:03:35.450> super<00:03:35.870> difficult<00:03:36.500> for<00:03:36.680> them<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.040> seize<00:03:37.490> and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
it super difficult for them to seize and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.790 
it super difficult for them to seize and
control<00:03:37.760> your<00:03:38.360> wrist<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.170> anti

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
control your wrist so this is anti

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.530 
control your wrist so this is anti
seasoned<00:03:40.250> control<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.910> you're<00:03:41.239> already

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
seasoned control and you're already

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.680 
seasoned control and you're already
slicing<00:03:42.410> away<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.250> if<00:03:43.370> they<00:03:43.489> do<00:03:43.550> grab<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.300> mean

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
slicing away so if they do grab I mean

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.690 
slicing away so if they do grab I mean
you<00:03:44.750> got<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:45.080> circular<00:03:46.069> see<00:03:46.310> right<00:03:46.520> there

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
you got that circular see right there

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.850 
you got that circular see right there
and<00:03:46.819> you<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.150> slash<00:03:47.720> right<00:03:48.260> into<00:03:48.500> their<00:03:48.650> arm

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
and you just slash right into their arm

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.540 
and you just slash right into their arm
okay

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
okay

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.870 
okay
so<00:03:50.030> that's<00:03:50.270> what<00:03:50.480> makes<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:52.100> advanced

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
so that's what makes this so advanced

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.690 
so that's what makes this so advanced
all<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.780> details<00:03:54.470> are<00:03:54.769> very<00:03:54.950> important<00:03:55.550> in

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
all the details are very important in

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.670 
all the details are very important in
such<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.300> good<00:03:56.540> move

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.250 

so<00:04:02.489> now<00:04:02.610> I'm<00:04:02.760> gonna<00:04:02.909> go<00:04:03.150> into<00:04:03.420> five<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.959> six

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
so now I'm gonna go into five and six

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
so now I'm gonna go into five and six
five<00:04:05.099> is<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.519> stab<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.209> six<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.830> slash

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
five is the stab and six is a slash

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.470 
five is the stab and six is a slash
right<00:04:08.580> there<00:04:08.849> okay<00:04:09.420> they<00:04:10.110> go<00:04:10.349> together<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
right there okay they go together and

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.960 
right there okay they go together and
once<00:04:12.480> again<00:04:12.780> as<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.440> stab<00:04:14.069> right<00:04:14.099> here<00:04:14.700> you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
once again as you stab right here you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.240 
once again as you stab right here you
immediately<00:04:15.569> come<00:04:15.959> into<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.829> circular

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
immediately come into the circular

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.039 
immediately come into the circular
motion<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:17.850> what<00:04:18.359> you're<00:04:18.510> doing<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.870> you're

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
motion so what you're doing is you're

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.740 
motion so what you're doing is you're
combining<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.709> two<00:04:19.919> movements<00:04:20.729> together<00:04:21.299> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
combining the two movements together and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.409 
combining the two movements together and
once<00:04:21.989> again<00:04:22.290> there<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.800> anti<00:04:23.280> grab<00:04:23.760> okay

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
once again there is that anti grab okay

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.930 
once again there is that anti grab okay

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.600 
open them up okay so the from the motion
seven<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.260> eight<00:05:01.410> is<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.860> figure<00:05:02.310> eight<00:05:02.580> motion

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
seven and eight is a figure eight motion

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.060 
seven and eight is a figure eight motion
and<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.960> reason<00:05:04.229> why<00:05:04.350> so<00:05:04.620> many<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.919> these

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
and the reason why so many of these

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.570 
and the reason why so many of these
moves<00:05:05.430> are<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:05.849> circular<00:05:06.450> is<00:05:06.660> because

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
moves are so circular is because

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.120 
moves are so circular is because
circular<00:05:08.580> motion<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:10.139> fastest<00:05:10.740> most

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
circular motion is the fastest most

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.400 
circular motion is the fastest most
efficient<00:05:11.700> way<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.880> continue<00:05:12.630> with<00:05:12.960> combos

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
efficient way to continue with combos

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.440 
efficient way to continue with combos
because<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:14.010> want<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.340> make<00:05:14.610> sure<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.180> if<00:05:15.300> we

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
because we want to make sure that if we

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.080 
because we want to make sure that if we
miss<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.780> we<00:05:16.169> still<00:05:16.650> keep<00:05:17.280> attacking<00:05:17.700> and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
miss that we still keep attacking and

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.960 
miss that we still keep attacking and
hopefully<00:05:18.690> one<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:19.020> them<00:05:19.169> who<00:05:19.860> is<00:05:20.039> gonna<00:05:20.370> work

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
hopefully one of them who is gonna work

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.120 
hopefully one of them who is gonna work
or<00:05:21.210> if<00:05:21.479> not<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:22.080> combination<00:05:22.710> of<00:05:22.860> all<00:05:23.010> these

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
or if not the combination of all these

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.670 
or if not the combination of all these
attacks<00:05:23.580> together<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:24.479> fluid<00:05:25.229> motion

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
attacks together in this fluid motion

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.029 
attacks together in this fluid motion
okay<00:05:26.599> from<00:05:27.599> seven<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.139> eight<00:05:28.289> right<00:05:28.440> here<00:05:28.500> it

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
okay from seven and eight right here it

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.210 
okay from seven and eight right here it
takes<00:05:29.520> us<00:05:29.789> to<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.630> next<00:05:30.960> combination<00:05:31.169> okay<00:05:32.160> so

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
takes us to the next combination okay so

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.969 
takes us to the next combination okay so
this<00:05:32.550> momentum<00:05:33.360> right<00:05:33.510> here<00:05:33.780> will<00:05:34.500> take<00:05:34.740> us

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
this momentum right here will take us

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.170 
this momentum right here will take us
into<00:05:35.330> nine<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.690> ten<00:05:37.310> okay<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:38.760> when<00:05:38.910> we<00:05:39.030> go

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
into nine and ten okay so when we go

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.089 
into nine and ten okay so when we go
into<00:05:39.330> nine<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:40.080> ten

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
into nine and ten

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.529 
into nine and ten
we're<00:05:41.220> actually<00:05:41.430> targeting<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.330> nerve

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
we're actually targeting the nerve

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.050 
we're actually targeting the nerve
clusters<00:05:43.169> right<00:05:43.740> here<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.130> here<00:05:44.460> okay

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
clusters right here in here okay

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.200 
clusters right here in here okay
so<00:05:45.389> nine<00:05:45.599> comes<00:05:45.870> in<00:05:46.080> this<00:05:46.260> way<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:47.090> then<00:05:48.090> we're

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
so nine comes in this way and then we're

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.310 
so nine comes in this way and then we're
gonna<00:05:48.300> bring<00:05:48.599> it<00:05:48.780> down<00:05:48.810> into<00:05:49.789> a<00:05:50.789> slash<00:05:51.660> so<00:05:52.139> this

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
gonna bring it down into a slash so this

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.830 
gonna bring it down into a slash so this
is<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.500> stab<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:53.130> slash<00:05:53.639> and<00:05:53.940> then<00:05:54.210> another<00:05:54.449> stab

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
is a stab a slash and then another stab

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.200 
is a stab a slash and then another stab
right<00:05:54.870> here<00:05:55.349> onto<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.830> other<00:05:55.979> side<00:05:56.340> okay<00:05:57.030> so

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
right here onto the other side okay so

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.930 
right here onto the other side okay so
it's<00:05:57.510> actually<00:05:57.660> three<00:05:58.349> hits<00:05:58.680> going<00:05:59.099> on<00:05:59.340> for

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
it's actually three hits going on for

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.060 
it's actually three hits going on for
this<00:06:00.060> one<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:00.960> maybe<00:06:01.199> with<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.530> stick<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:01.979> was

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
this one so maybe with the stick it was

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.870 
this one so maybe with the stick it was
only<00:06:02.280> two<00:06:02.430> hits<00:06:02.699> but<00:06:02.970> for<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:03.330> one<00:06:03.539> it's<00:06:03.990> and

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
only two hits but for this one it's and

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.700 
only two hits but for this one it's and
then<00:06:05.880> there's<00:06:06.150> number<00:06:06.539> three<00:06:06.660> so<00:06:07.139> it's<00:06:07.289> three

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
then there's number three so it's three

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.080 
then there's number three so it's three
strikes<00:06:07.979> put<00:06:08.729> into<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:09.530> combination<00:06:10.530> together

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
strikes put into a combination together

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.140 
strikes put into a combination together
now<00:06:12.090> the<00:06:12.150> last<00:06:12.450> one<00:06:12.719> is<00:06:13.200> of<00:06:14.099> course

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
now the last one is of course

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.300 
now the last one is of course
comes<00:06:15.420> from<00:06:15.540> the<00:06:15.690> Albany<00:06:15.870> commotion<00:06:16.680> so<00:06:17.070> it's

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
comes from the Albany commotion so it's

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.150 
comes from the Albany commotion so it's
a<00:06:17.550> slash<00:06:17.910> and<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.960> slash<00:06:19.230> right<00:06:19.500> here<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:19.980> we

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
a slash and a slash right here and we

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.340 
a slash and a slash right here and we
all<00:06:20.310> know<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.670> benefits<00:06:20.820> for<00:06:21.540> that<00:06:21.780> that

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
all know the benefits for that that

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.500 
all know the benefits for that that
motion<00:06:22.680> in<00:06:23.010> itself<00:06:23.460> I've<00:06:23.730> explained<00:06:24.270> in<00:06:24.390> other

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
motion in itself I've explained in other

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.290 
motion in itself I've explained in other
videos<00:06:24.630> is<00:06:25.290> almost<00:06:25.950> like<00:06:26.100> a<00:06:26.160> combo<00:06:26.610> starter<00:06:26.880> or

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
videos is almost like a combo starter or

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.470 
videos is almost like a combo starter or
even<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.140> combo<00:06:28.500> finisher<00:06:28.740> so<00:06:29.280> it<00:06:30.030> goes<00:06:30.240> very

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
even a combo finisher so it goes very

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.950 
even a combo finisher so it goes very
very<00:06:30.600> well<00:06:30.990> with<00:06:31.170> Chaney<00:06:31.500> moves<00:06:31.800> together

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.760 

so<00:06:37.169> dynamic<00:06:38.030> circular<00:06:39.030> motions<00:06:39.630> are<00:06:40.229> great

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
so dynamic circular motions are great

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.430 
so dynamic circular motions are great
for<00:06:41.280> combos<00:06:41.819> you<00:06:42.060> need<00:06:42.419> to<00:06:42.600> know<00:06:42.780> how<00:06:43.020> to<00:06:43.050> do<00:06:43.289> it

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
for combos you need to know how to do it

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.320 
for combos you need to know how to do it
you<00:06:43.770> know<00:06:43.889> there's<00:06:44.069> a<00:06:44.130> reason<00:06:44.370> why<00:06:44.639> the<00:06:44.699> boxers

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
you know there's a reason why the boxers

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.200 
you know there's a reason why the boxers
work<00:06:45.630> on<00:06:45.919> the<00:06:46.919> speed<00:06:47.310> bag<00:06:47.340> you<00:06:47.940> know<00:06:48.000> with

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
work on the speed bag you know with

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.089 
work on the speed bag you know with
circular<00:06:48.630> motions<00:06:49.020> like<00:06:49.169> that<00:06:49.380> because<00:06:49.740> you

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
circular motions like that because you

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:53.089 
circular motions like that because you
know<00:06:50.250> the<00:06:50.550> this<00:06:51.060> is<00:06:51.240> the<00:06:51.330> type<00:06:51.539> of<00:06:52.099> body

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
know the this is the type of body

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.939 
know the this is the type of body
mechanics<00:06:53.340> necessary<00:06:54.330> to<00:06:54.599> do<00:06:54.750> combos<00:06:55.229> now<00:06:55.740> on

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
mechanics necessary to do combos now on

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.420 
mechanics necessary to do combos now on
top<00:06:56.310> of<00:06:56.370> that<00:06:56.610> with<00:06:57.349> knife<00:06:58.349> combat<00:06:58.889> these

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
top of that with knife combat these

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.730 
top of that with knife combat these
dynamic<00:07:00.270> circular<00:07:00.720> motions<00:07:01.139> also<00:07:01.440> make<00:07:01.620> it

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
dynamic circular motions also make it

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.279 
dynamic circular motions also make it
very<00:07:02.190> very<00:07:02.430> difficult<00:07:02.669> for<00:07:03.300> the<00:07:03.630> other<00:07:03.810> person

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
very very difficult for the other person

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:14.629 
very very difficult for the other person
to<00:07:04.789> seize<00:07:05.789> and<00:07:06.180> control<00:07:06.210> your<00:07:06.960> wrists
