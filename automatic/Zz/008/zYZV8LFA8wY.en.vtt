then<00:00:45.800> when<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.010> get<00:00:46.190> there<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:46.730> watch

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
then when you get there and you watch

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.030 
then when you get there and you watch
the<00:00:47.030> smoke<00:00:47.300> garage<00:00:47.810> they<00:00:48.230> calm<00:00:48.470> down<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:48.920> then

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
the smoke garage they calm down and then

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.990 
the smoke garage they calm down and then
you<00:00:49.160> can't<00:00:49.370> see<00:00:49.579> anything

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
you can't see anything

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.450 
you can't see anything
I<00:00:50.090> did<00:00:50.300> feel<00:00:50.450> like<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.660> firefighter<00:00:51.460> you're

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
I did feel like a firefighter you're

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.510 
I did feel like a firefighter you're
never<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.060> be<00:00:53.150> wet<00:00:53.390> hot<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.989> filthy<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.220> you

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
never to be wet hot and filthy so you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.220 
never to be wet hot and filthy so you
know<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:56.000> feels<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.300> bit<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.450> fighting<00:00:56.930> actual

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
know it feels a bit like fighting actual

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.780 
know it feels a bit like fighting actual
fires<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:57.800> think<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.010> average<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.280> about<00:00:58.370> three

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
fires I think the average is about three

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.639 
fires I think the average is about three
showers<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.570> get<00:00:59.720> over<00:00:59.989> some<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.230> those<00:01:00.320> scenes

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
showers to get over some of those scenes

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.650 
showers to get over some of those scenes
yeah<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.220> get<00:01:01.460> quite<00:01:01.640> claustrophobic<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.540> when

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
yeah I get quite claustrophobic so when

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.329 
yeah I get quite claustrophobic so when
I<00:01:02.690> put<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:02.989> be<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.140> mask<00:01:03.500> on<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:03.800> first<00:01:03.980> time<00:01:04.220> I

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
I put the be a mask on the first time I

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.700 
I put the be a mask on the first time I
thought<00:01:04.460> oh<00:01:04.549> my<00:01:04.790> god<00:01:04.939> oh<00:01:05.119> my<00:01:05.269> god<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.840> felt<00:01:06.380> free

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
thought oh my god oh my god I felt free

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.129 
thought oh my god oh my god I felt free
that's<00:01:06.950> gonna<00:01:07.070> start<00:01:07.340> working<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:08.810> didn't

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
that's gonna start working if you didn't

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:11.289 
that's gonna start working if you didn't
have<00:01:09.289> your<00:01:09.380> BA<00:01:09.619> on<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.850> were<00:01:10.939> in<00:01:11.090> there

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
have your BA on and you were in there

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.940 
have your BA on and you were in there
without<00:01:11.630> any<00:01:12.079> breathing<00:01:12.259> apparatus<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.859> know

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
without any breathing apparatus you know

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.620 
without any breathing apparatus you know
you<00:01:13.009> could<00:01:13.249> possibly<00:01:13.759> die<00:01:13.969> it's<00:01:14.359> scary

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
you could possibly die it's scary

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.419 
you could possibly die it's scary
sometimes<00:01:14.899> but<00:01:15.319> we're<00:01:15.560> always<00:01:15.649> very<00:01:15.920> safe<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
sometimes but we're always very safe and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.919 
sometimes but we're always very safe and
I<00:01:16.700> think<00:01:17.149> it's<00:01:17.240> great<00:01:17.359> because<00:01:17.539> because<00:01:17.840> you

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
I think it's great because because you

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.539 
I think it's great because because you
can<00:01:18.079> really<00:01:18.409> see<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:19.009> was<00:01:19.100> doing<00:01:19.399> them

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
can really see but it's I was doing them

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.580 
can really see but it's I was doing them
and<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.789> sort<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.509> just<00:01:20.929> makes<00:01:21.139> it<00:01:21.259> seem<00:01:21.409> all

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
and that sort of just makes it seem all

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.770 
and that sort of just makes it seem all
the<00:01:21.619> more<00:01:21.709> real

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
the more real
