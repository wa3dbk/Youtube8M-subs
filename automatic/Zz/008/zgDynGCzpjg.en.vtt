00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
so it took me quite a while to figure it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.310 
so it took me quite a while to figure it
out<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.280> I'm<00:01:29.119> looking<00:01:29.360> all<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.750> spices<00:01:30.049> you

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.270 
know you got sesame seeds and poppy
seeds<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.440> know<00:01:33.560> how<00:01:33.710> does<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:33.920> play

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
seeds and you know how does that play

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.010 
seeds and you know how does that play
off<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.640> crushed<00:01:34.880> rosemary<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.510> then<00:01:35.659> not

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
off the crushed rosemary and then not

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.469 
off the crushed rosemary and then not
probably<00:01:36.890> work<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.729> bottles<00:01:38.119> down<00:01:38.270> from

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
probably work for bottles down from

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.300 
probably work for bottles down from
crushed<00:01:38.720> rosemary<00:01:38.930> they're<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.830> store<00:01:40.070> was

basil leaves

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.160 
basil leaves
so<00:01:42.409> obviously<00:01:42.979> basil<00:01:43.640> has<00:01:43.909> left<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
so obviously basil has left and it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.920 
so obviously basil has left and it
crushed<00:01:45.860> rosemary<00:01:46.330> candy<00:01:47.330> corn<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.689> not

crushed rosemary candy corn is not

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.140 
crushed rosemary candy corn is not
really<00:01:48.830> easy<00:01:49.010> to<00:01:49.159> work<00:01:49.400> with<00:01:49.580> with<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.850> wires

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
really easy to work with with the wires

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.600 
really easy to work with with the wires
