00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.380 

so<00:01:56.190> once<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.520> mixture<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.210> your

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
so once all the mixture is in your

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
so once all the mixture is in your
silicone<00:01:57.870> muffin<00:01:58.170> trays<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
silicone muffin trays you just want to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
silicone muffin trays you just want to
press<00:01:59.370> them<00:01:59.610> down<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.090> they're<00:02:00.270> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
press them down so that they're really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.760 
press them down so that they're really
tightly<00:02:00.870> compact<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.260> this<00:02:04.380> should<00:02:04.530> start

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
tightly compact so if this should start

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.140 
tightly compact so if this should start
to<00:02:04.950> look<00:02:05.040> something<00:02:05.400> like<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.730> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.120> just

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
to look something like this and you just

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.000 
to look something like this and you just
want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> pop<00:02:06.750> them<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.050> your<00:02:07.260> preheated<00:02:07.500> oven

want to pop them in your preheated oven
at<00:02:08.340> 160<00:02:09.000> degrees<00:02:09.240> C<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:10.200> 17<00:02:10.830> minutes

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.840 

so<00:02:16.740> once<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> macaroons<00:02:17.430> are<00:02:17.550> finished

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
so once the macaroons are finished

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.640 
so once the macaroons are finished
baking<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.480> want<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> allow<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.440> cool

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
