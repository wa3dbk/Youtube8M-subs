00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.700
 so for synchronized swimming 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.930
 either stuffed because it takes 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.210
 a lot of time for her it's a little 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.119
 complicated the horizon project we did not 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.770
 of front functions in our jerseys sai 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.660
 sai does a lot since all 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.880
 recognized sports have a lot of 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.980
 merchants and 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.809
 close to the financial 2 we can not 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.800
 have it unfortunately because it's 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.570
 a regulation we do not have the right to 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.980
 to put a jersey article on how do we 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.449
 could be more recognized it's with 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.059
 the media help they can we 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.079
 show a little more watched over them 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.879
 rooms and requests a change of 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.129
 dress already and the games that pass all 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.900
 the four years we try to show it 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.809
 will be made the world but it's little 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.370
 often not open channels to any 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.600
 the world it's true that it's complicated 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.089
 after that I have to be more 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.360
 popular already inside each 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.540
 country 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.580
 and you in sport in the same sport 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.009
 it's recognized because we as 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.810
 sports with other disciplines 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.610
 we are recognized because they understand 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.080
 the difficulty is not in the world of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.619
 sport you have to be recognized it's a 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.619
 outside world 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.680
 generally when way 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.360
 big game where I already established a theme 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.320
 of a desire that comes to me from things that 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.550
 I was watching, but I'm still 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.750
 very curious I also have a lot 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.790
 many watched from classical dance 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.350
 the modern dance of skating the gym the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.060
 I think all these sports 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.560
 artistic inspires us anyway 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.850
 whatever the gesture we can 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 reproduce but it's really an image 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.200
 even sometimes clips to everything that has 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.110
 something aspiring artistic it's 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.330
 very important to be interested in everything 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.680
 what is around 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.590
 after yes once I established a 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.390
 game theme but still different 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.010
 music 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.420
 coach me movie because I 'm trying 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.130
 to really immerse myself in music 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.710
 I 'm happy I 'm listening once 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.720
 I really put myself in and we film 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.340
 I have to film myself because I am 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.930
 unable to know what I have what 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.760
 I did so after we look at 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.380
 videos is one is one draws all who well 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.390
 all that is not good we leave of 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.830
 side and I'm trying to reproduce that which 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.910
 is often difficult because 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.770
 that when you do something 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.870
 interesting spontaneously it's very 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.090
 difficult after reproducing that's it 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.890
 after that it's work includes 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.200
 a few things like that and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.180
 start many times I leave myself 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.790
 completely go music inspires me 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.400
 really a lot I really try to 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.440
 follow the sound and after I try to 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.700
 find the performance so when you 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.470
 do improvisations I try 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.810
 always from 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.910
 some pies find something hyper 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.140
 strong that there are a little bit both of them a 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.480
 side I let myself go 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 I think of nothing and the other side I am 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.160
 very careful about it being very 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.160
 strong 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.300
 so my first title of champion of the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.460
 world I'm waiting for it already finds since 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.410
 years because it was said that I was 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.270
 very close is every time indeed 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.790
 I must have received a little slap 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.590
 so that was the culmination game 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.150
 it's true that the year before I had 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.900
 won the world cup it was a little 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.910
 a logic 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.590
 now these are the water the exchanged 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.360
 request to barcelona on the madness was 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.550
 really particular and was coming out again 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.560
 more of the ordinary so it's some 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.060
 something that was very strong at the level of 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.580
 the pressure of the inner tension 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.400
 when I will be able to pardon myself 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.510
 I have a magic memory of it because 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.220
 it was in barcelona because there is 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.390
 a lot of people who came who could 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.640
 come see me because it was close 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.310
 from France 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.500
 my girlfriends were there at an old 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 swimmer and so she was on the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.580
 moment I believe that the biggest 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.930
 remember that I have on this result there 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.290
 that's when I came back after 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.760
 podium 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.350
 everyone waited for me in the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.970
 bleachers ok press conferences 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.320
 anti-doping control etc 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.790
 I came really a good time 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.980
 after and everyone else still 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.990
 waited and there I was taped that it takes 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.190
 the most nothing to do oussama that me 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.190
 really liked it was not it 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.380
 if I think of a con 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.780
 no I've done it after a year and 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.820
 half high level stop it's been 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.080
 very hard I needed it I regret 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.670
 absolutely not to have necessarily done 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.290
 more because I won even though with 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.280
 my girlfriend I think it was necessary that 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.710
 this time we needed 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.230
 now I 'm having fun with my 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.090
 club I'm having fun and I'm trying to 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.780
 bring at the same time but I am 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.850
 unable to do high level 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.850
 physically I can not stand the road anymore 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.200
 so I was indeed singing 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.480
 France national to x but I have not everything 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.090
 saw I saw the team final and I did 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.600
 some workouts the level in 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.340
 France except on this competition there 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.470
 I was surprised by the power of 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.690
 retro thrusts and displacement was 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.460
 not bad overall now 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.610
 I think we're losing a little bit of 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.919
 force and technique especially because 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.260
 impose them disappeared in seniors 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.910
 why do I think we're doing a little 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.710
 little attention but it feels on the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.690
 brooms and I think that's what has 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.940
 makes our strength to the May generation 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.260
 especially with my friends no it's for 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.880
 we have an Olympic medal 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.890
 we were first and foremost technicians 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.110
 we worked a lot and figures 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.850
 imposed so do not skimp there 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.260
 on it and I know it's forbidding 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.820
 and that's not the most interesting 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.500
 in the sacro but that's what you 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.820
 will give all the support and all 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.090
 assets afterwards to make ben ali very 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.090
 very strong 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.720
 so I started synchro at six 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.620
 and a half by chance why so I 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.730
 lack I did not know had all these 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.620
 sports I was doing classical dance 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.920
 I absolutely wanted to do the little ones 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.440
 Opera rats 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.970
 and if I was usually dance 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.770
 modern and I was looking for a course of 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.529
 classical dance and this while discussing with 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.849
 my modern dance teacher that 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.279
 we learned the existence of swimming 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.409
 synchronized my mother put me to sport 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.579
 to let off steam for fun says to himself 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.169
 why not since I knew how to swim 

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:15.559
 I loved dancing so it's a good 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.689
 mixed 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:18.979
 I tested I loved the year after 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.959
 I did ballet made 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.389
 two for a very long time and after 

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:24.619
 Here it was I think it was 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.299
 had to fall like that because 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:27.769
 I feel really very good in 

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:29.149
 the water I have a lot more going without 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.119
 the other on earth where it's sport that 

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:34.549
 I needed it happened by competition of 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:36.709
 circumstances like that it took me I 

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:37.759
 hung I was watching the big ones too 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:40.129
 since at that time there are 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.589
 juniors to his fears in my club who 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.159
 arrived and it made us want 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:45.019
 I was always in the process of 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.259
 look for movement movements I 

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:47.259
 make me happy
