00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.800
 the following model of the fujifilm x100 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.400
 is the x100 it was this at the beginning 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 of the year 2013 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.329
 For the most part, fujifilm is oriented 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 at the x100 it's on the predecessor a few 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.410
 innovations but there is still the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 Picture taking takes place at the Fujifilm 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.140
 x100 it is an aps c sensor with 23 6 x 15.8 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.600
 mm size and 16 megapixel resolution 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 through the special color filter decix 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.500
 Trans you must have two sensors with you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.920
 dispensed with a low pass filter 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 become 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 the sensitivity settings are sufficient 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.720
 for all image formats from iso 200 to 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.320
 iso 6,400 with jpeg images can the iso 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.760
 range to iso 100 and up to iso 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 25,600 to be extended 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.939
 The 23mm Fujinon lens covers one 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.310
 Small picture equivalent focal length of 35 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.549
 mm and has a light intensity of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.770
 f2 even in sunshine the big one 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.659
 Being able to use open was a three 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
 stages nd filter integrated 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.790
 the biggest feature of the fujifilm 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.800
 x100 it's your hybrid search 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.330
 this can be on the one hand as 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.790
 optical viewfinder with overlays 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.780
 on the other hand, as well as 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.930
 electronic viewfinder 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.140
 the display is only 2 8 inches tall its 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.060
 resolution is one in 460,000 pixel 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.860
 integrated flash unit is available 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 over the lightning shoe can be but 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 and external lightning drive as 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.229
 Exposure modes offers the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.080
 digital camera an automatic program 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.479
 a time and aperture automatic as well 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.060
 a manual exposure mode at 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.810
 fujifilm typical movie 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 simulation model and different 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.159
 to filter creatively such as one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.070
 Pinhole effect complement the photo 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.229
 program videos takes the fujifilm x100 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.640
 it in full hd resolution with 60 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.640
 frame up every second 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.420
 the sound is recorded via a 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.519
 integrated and walk-in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.019
 stereo microphone with battery and 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:21.769

 place next to this introductory video 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.350
 we give you the camera in other videos 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.210
 in detail before they learn about 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.830
 example closer to the equipment 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.830
