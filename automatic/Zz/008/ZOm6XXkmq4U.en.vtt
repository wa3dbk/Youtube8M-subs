teach you how to check your tread depth

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.220 
teach you how to check your tread depth
on<00:00:12.929> your<00:00:13.500> tires<00:00:13.799> properly<00:00:14.750> tread<00:00:15.750> depth<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
on your tires properly tread depth is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.179 
on your tires properly tread depth is
very<00:00:16.619> important<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> measure<00:00:17.779> once<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.900> month

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
very important to measure once a month

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.310 
very important to measure once a month
it's<00:00:20.189> important<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.630> your<00:00:21.930> tread

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it's important because if your tread

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
it's important because if your tread
depth<00:00:22.590> gets<00:00:23.010> below<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> 30<00:00:23.939> seconds<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.449> an

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
depth gets below to 30 seconds of an

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.640 
depth gets below to 30 seconds of an
inch<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.560> only<00:00:26.039> are<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:27.170> risking<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.349> blowout

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
inch not only are you risking a blowout

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.890 
inch not only are you risking a blowout
or<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> flat<00:00:29.250> tire<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.210> also<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.869> very

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
or a flat tire but it's also can be very

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.770 
or a flat tire but it's also can be very
dangerous<00:00:31.500> especially<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.669> rain<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.210> snow

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
dangerous especially in rain or snow

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.299 
dangerous especially in rain or snow
because<00:00:34.590> you're<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.829> getting<00:00:35.130> enough

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
because you're not getting enough

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.690 
because you're not getting enough
traction<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.530> gonna<00:00:37.620> check<00:00:38.040> we're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
traction so we're gonna check we're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.100 
traction so we're gonna check we're
gonna<00:00:38.790> use<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> couple<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.510> techniques<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
gonna use a couple of techniques to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
gonna use a couple of techniques to
check<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.680> tread<00:00:40.980> depth<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.969> heavier<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
check your tread depth so heavier is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.810 
check your tread depth so heavier is
here<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.410> me<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> he's<00:00:44.250> gonna<00:00:44.399> demonstrate

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
here with me and he's gonna demonstrate

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.900 
here with me and he's gonna demonstrate
the<00:00:45.329> proper<00:00:45.780> technique<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:47.039> check<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.579> tire

tread<00:00:48.180> depth<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:49.890> technique<00:00:50.399> we're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
tread depth the first technique we're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
tread depth the first technique we're
going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> use<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.750> tire<00:00:52.379> tread<00:00:52.739> depth

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
going to use is using a tire tread depth

if you if you do need tires I recommend

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
if you if you do need tires I recommend
you<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.610> four<00:01:38.970> new<00:01:39.150> tires<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> can't

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you get four new tires but if you can't

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
you get four new tires but if you can't
do<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.310> need<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> buy<00:01:41.790> tires<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.450> pairs

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
do that you need to buy tires in pairs

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.160 
do that you need to buy tires in pairs
front<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.860> rear<00:01:44.220> since<00:01:45.030> front<00:01:45.360> tires<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.899> most

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
front and rear since front tires do most

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170 
front and rear since front tires do most
of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> braking<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.250> probably<00:01:47.729> need<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of the braking you probably need to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
of the braking you probably need to
check<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.720> tire<00:01:49.020> tread<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.920> front

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
check your tire tread and your front

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
check your tire tread and your front
tires<00:01:50.490> work<00:01:50.820> frequently<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.710> suggest<00:01:52.710> checking

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
tires work frequently I suggest checking

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
tires work frequently I suggest checking
your<00:01:53.220> tire<00:01:53.460> tread<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:54.090> every<00:01:54.450> oil<00:01:54.720> change

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
your tire tread at every oil change

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.740
