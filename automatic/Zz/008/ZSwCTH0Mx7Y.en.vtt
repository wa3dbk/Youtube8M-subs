access to trauma admitting which is
right<00:00:21.190> there<00:00:24.420> he<00:00:25.420> definitely<00:00:25.869> was<00:00:26.230> involved

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
right there he definitely was involved

right there he definitely was involved

in a motor vehicle crash it doesn't from
the<00:00:28.600> history<00:00:28.900> doesn't<00:00:29.170> sound<00:00:29.529> like<00:00:29.740> it<00:00:29.859> was<00:00:29.949> a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
the history doesn't sound like it was a

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.859 
the history doesn't sound like it was a
high-speed<00:00:30.580> accident<00:00:31.119> or<00:00:31.210> something<00:00:31.420> as<00:00:31.689> well

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
high-speed accident or something as well

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.809 
high-speed accident or something as well
I<00:00:31.900> stopped<00:00:32.289> another<00:00:32.649> car<00:00:32.949> just<00:00:33.489> crossed<00:00:33.699> a

I stopped another car just crossed a

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.489 
I stopped another car just crossed a
stop<00:00:34.059> sign<00:00:34.300> so<00:00:34.569> it<00:00:34.659> doesn't<00:00:34.929> sound<00:00:35.050> like<00:00:35.229> it's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
stop sign so it doesn't sound like it's

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:36.959

a<00:00:35.589> high-speed<00:00:36.039> accident<00:00:36.609> where<00:00:36.699> we<00:00:36.789> would

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
a high-speed accident where we would

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.689 
a high-speed accident where we would
suspect<00:00:37.390> like<00:00:37.539> very<00:00:38.109> more<00:00:38.889> severe<00:00:39.190> injuries

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
suspect like very more severe injuries

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.389 
suspect like very more severe injuries
when<00:00:40.210> such<00:00:41.019> trauma<00:00:41.289> patients<00:00:41.739> come<00:00:41.889> in<00:00:42.039> we<00:00:42.190> do

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
when such trauma patients come in we do

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.549 
when such trauma patients come in we do
a<00:00:42.940> quick<00:00:43.389> assessment<00:00:43.569> to<00:00:44.079> see<00:00:44.260> if<00:00:44.289> there<00:00:44.530> is

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
a quick assessment to see if there is

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.649 
a quick assessment to see if there is
any<00:00:44.769> major<00:00:45.370> organ<00:00:45.879> injury<00:00:46.210> he's<00:00:46.449> bleeding

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
any major organ injury he's bleeding

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.450 
any major organ injury he's bleeding
somewhere<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.499> a<00:00:47.620> head<00:00:47.859> injury<00:00:48.010> those<00:00:48.339> are

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
somewhere it is a head injury those are

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.709 
somewhere it is a head injury those are
the<00:00:48.549> things<00:00:48.729> we<00:00:48.850> need<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:49.089> act<00:00:49.239> upon<00:00:49.510> right

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
the things we need to act upon right

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.479 
the things we need to act upon right
away<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.440> that's<00:00:50.530> when<00:00:50.769> we<00:00:50.799> do<00:00:51.039> like<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.280> quick

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
away so that's when we do like a quick

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:59.939 
away so that's when we do like a quick
assessment<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.989> entire<00:00:53.709> body<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.739> there's

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
assessment of the entire body so there's

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.340
