00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
have been a different of course anyway

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.300 
have been a different of course anyway
let's<00:01:39.479> take<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> look<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.170> his<00:01:40.409> stats<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:41.130> will

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
let's take a look at his stats he will

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.999 
let's take a look at his stats he will
lose<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.880> pace<00:01:42.119> because<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.869> his<00:01:43.140> age<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.979> he

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
lose some pace because of his age so he

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.990 
lose some pace because of his age so he
will<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.759> from<00:01:45.240> 77<00:01:45.840> 275<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.700> +1

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
will go down from 77 275 he will get +1

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910

heading minus one and defending and of

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.219 
heading minus one and defending and of
course<00:01:52.439> his<00:01:52.860> overall<00:01:53.399> will<00:01:53.939> no<00:01:54.149> longer<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.810> 88

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
course his overall will no longer be 88

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.609

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.830 
on the list is Eden Hazard and as you
see<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> kept<00:02:07.859> his<00:02:08.039> overall<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.580> 87<00:02:09.180> but<00:02:09.630> maybe

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
see I kept his overall at 87 but maybe

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.350 
see I kept his overall at 87 but maybe
he<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.619> downgraded<00:02:11.310> by<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.850> everyone

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
he will be downgraded by one everyone

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.870 
he will be downgraded by one everyone
expected<00:02:12.990> more<00:02:13.230> from<00:02:13.260> him<00:02:13.680> that's<00:02:13.980> why<00:02:14.310> they

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
expected more from him that's why they

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.580 
expected more from him that's why they
are<00:02:15.000> disappointed<00:02:15.600> he<00:02:15.780> had<00:02:15.990> some<00:02:16.320> great

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
are disappointed he had some great

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.979 
are disappointed he had some great
moments<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.280> think<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:18.269> his<00:02:18.480> talent<00:02:18.959> he

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
moments but I think with his talent he

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.860 
moments but I think with his talent he
can<00:02:19.260> do<00:02:19.440> even<00:02:19.739> more<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.819> he<00:02:21.150> played<00:02:21.390> 40<00:02:21.720> games

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
can do even more so he played 40 games

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.380 
can do even more so he played 40 games

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
only 10 goals but making 14 asses so it

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.949 
only 10 goals but making 14 asses so it
was<00:02:26.830> pretty<00:02:27.010> decent<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.180> decrease<00:02:28.540> his<00:02:28.720> deep

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
was pretty decent so I decrease his deep

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.920 
was pretty decent so I decrease his deep
link<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.470> heading<00:02:29.950> by<00:02:30.459> 2<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.940> he's<00:02:31.480> defending

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
link and heading by 2 and he's defending

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.380 
link and heading by 2 and he's defending
by<00:02:32.110> three<00:02:32.440> his<00:02:33.010> face<00:02:33.310> will<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> same<00:02:34.090> or

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
by three his face will be the same or

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.440 
by three his face will be the same or
maybe<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.500> don't<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.830> minus<00:02:36.520> one<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
maybe like I don't know minus one and I

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.900 
maybe like I don't know minus one and I
think<00:02:37.690> he<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.800> plus<00:02:39.010> 2<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.400> shooting<00:02:39.760> n

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
think he will get plus 2 in shooting n

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.050 
think he will get plus 2 in shooting n
plus<00:02:40.180> 1<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:40.930> passing<00:02:41.740> maybe<00:02:42.340> he<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.730> play<00:02:43.030> a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
plus 1 in passing maybe he will play a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.870 
plus 1 in passing maybe he will play a
lot<00:02:43.300> better<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.810> year<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:45.160> way<00:02:45.430> he

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
lot better this year and that way he

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.400 
lot better this year and that way he
might<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.600> player<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.840> everyone

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
might be the player that everyone

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.100 
might be the player that everyone
expects<00:02:47.890> him<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.190> be<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:49.000> last<00:02:49.270> places<00:02:49.600> by<00:02:50.080> you

a centre-forward in a fee 14 or maybe a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.199 
a centre-forward in a fee 14 or maybe a
striker<00:03:07.720> since<00:03:08.410> that's<00:03:08.650> where<00:03:09.010> he<00:03:09.220> played<00:03:09.519> so

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
striker since that's where he played so

I gave him on 83 overall increased by

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.970 
I gave him on 83 overall increased by
only<00:03:13.330> one<00:03:13.600> because<00:03:14.019> he<00:03:14.230> helped<00:03:14.500> your<00:03:14.650> rentals

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
only one because he helped your rentals

only one because he helped your rentals
win<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.280> foul<00:03:15.459> anyway<00:03:15.940> his<00:03:16.090> face<00:03:16.360> will<00:03:16.570> go

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
win the foul anyway his face will go

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.890 
win the foul anyway his face will go
down<00:03:17.200> by<00:03:17.590> two<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.190> he's<00:03:18.459> dribbling<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.630> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
down by two and he's dribbling the the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.990 
down by two and he's dribbling the the
same<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.440> think<00:03:20.709> he<00:03:20.860> will<00:03:21.040> get<00:03:21.519> plus<00:03:21.760> 20

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
same I think he will get plus 20

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.090 
same I think he will get plus 20
shooting<00:03:22.690> plus<00:03:22.930> two<00:03:23.080> passing<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:23.830> predict

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
shooting plus two passing can I predict

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.940 
shooting plus two passing can I predict
that<00:03:24.130> he<00:03:24.430> will<00:03:24.550> become<00:03:24.700> 4<00:03:25.510> star<00:03:25.750> skills<00:03:26.050> in

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
that he will become 4 star skills in

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.640 
that he will become 4 star skills in
fifa<00:03:27.220> 12<00:03:27.400> he<00:03:27.610> was<00:03:27.760> five<00:03:28.030> star<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.510> now<00:03:29.350> when<00:03:29.620> he

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
fifa 12 he was five star and now when he

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.699 
fifa 12 he was five star and now when he
14<00:03:30.010> he<00:03:30.340> was<00:03:30.519> decreased<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.480> free<00:03:31.780> but<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.380> think

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
14 he was decreased to free but I think

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.069 
14 he was decreased to free but I think
four<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.459> where<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:34.090> should<00:03:34.120> be<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:35.049> other

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079

four is where it should be the other
