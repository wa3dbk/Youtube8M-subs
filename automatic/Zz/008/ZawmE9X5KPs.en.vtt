drain in a gravel drive and you can see

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.160 
drain in a gravel drive and you can see
we've<00:00:08.160> already<00:00:08.370> pulled<00:00:08.790> back<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.510> top<00:00:09.750> still

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
we've already pulled back the top still

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.870 
we've already pulled back the top still
at<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> top<00:00:10.530> gravel<00:00:10.800> because<00:00:11.519> we're<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
at the top gravel because we're going to

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.419 
at the top gravel because we're going to
run<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> trench<00:00:12.450> down<00:00:13.200> through<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.889> with

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
run a trench down through here with

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.029 
run a trench down through here with
gravel<00:00:14.910> perforated<00:00:15.570> pipe<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.650> help<00:00:16.830> collect

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
gravel perforated pipe to help collect

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.720 
gravel perforated pipe to help collect
water<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.119> pooling<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> driveway

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
water that is pooling in this driveway

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.210 
water that is pooling in this driveway
and<00:00:20.910> also<00:00:21.210> washing<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> gravel<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.130> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
and also washing out the gravel so it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
and also washing out the gravel so it
comes<00:00:23.460> down<00:00:23.640> through<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:26.359> here<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.510> run<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
comes down through here here we run the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.830 
comes down through here here we run the
lateral<00:00:28.260> across<00:00:28.880> we'll<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.060> another<00:00:30.090> lateral

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
lateral across we'll put another lateral

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
lateral across we'll put another lateral
down<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.279> water<00:00:32.520> comes<00:00:32.910> across

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
down there so as that water comes across

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
down there so as that water comes across
that<00:00:33.559> section<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.770> drops<00:00:35.070> into<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> gravel

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that section there drops into the gravel

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.790 
that section there drops into the gravel
perforated<00:00:36.239> pipe<00:00:36.450> comes<00:00:37.170> over<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
perforated pipe comes over here on the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.639 
perforated pipe comes over here on the
other<00:00:37.920> side<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> bushes<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.290> will<00:00:40.379> go<00:00:40.500> all

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
other side of the bushes and will go all

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.750 
other side of the bushes and will go all
the<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> street<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the way out to the street for the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.779 
the way out to the street for the
discharge<00:00:42.860> okay<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.280> started

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
discharge okay so we just started

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.260 
discharge okay so we just started
trenching<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:46.200> found<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.920> concrete<00:00:47.879> slurry

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
trenching and we found a concrete slurry

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.200 
trenching and we found a concrete slurry
that<00:00:48.450> had<00:00:48.780> been<00:00:48.960> poured<00:00:49.550> underneath<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that had been poured underneath of this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
that had been poured underneath of this
gravel<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.710> we're<00:00:52.860> doing<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.280> we're

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
gravel and what we're doing is we're

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.920 
gravel and what we're doing is we're
going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> pick<00:00:53.789> through<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.809> we

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
going to pick through there to see if we

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.139 
going to pick through there to see if we
can<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> trencher<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.460> down<00:00:56.699> under

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
can get the trencher to get down under

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
can get the trencher to get down under
that<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.690> maybe<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> teeth<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> trencher

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that and maybe the teeth of the trencher

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.060 
that and maybe the teeth of the trencher
can<00:01:00.120> pull<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> out

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.700 

well<00:01:04.310> then<00:01:04.460> make<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.760> bigger<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.480> I<00:01:05.540> can<00:01:05.620> if<00:01:06.620> I

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
well then make it bigger so I can if I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.990 
well then make it bigger so I can if I
can<00:01:06.860> get<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.070> trencher<00:01:07.430> down<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.820> there<00:01:07.970> I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
can get the trencher down in there I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.620 
can get the trencher down in there I
might<00:01:08.270> be<00:01:08.450> able<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.690> rip<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:08.990> up

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.170 

as<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.380> can<00:01:15.530> see<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:16.219> would<00:01:16.369> take<00:01:16.610> thousands

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
as you can see it would take thousands

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.420 
as you can see it would take thousands
of<00:01:17.299> dollars<00:01:17.659> worth<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:18.020> labour<00:01:18.289> try<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.130> pick

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
of dollars worth of labour try to pick

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.999 
of dollars worth of labour try to pick
through<00:01:19.789> this<00:01:20.090> concrete<00:01:20.719> but<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.680> a<00:01:21.710> little

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
through this concrete but with a little

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.670 
through this concrete but with a little
ingenuity<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.390> strong<00:01:23.780> belief<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.259> you

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
ingenuity and a strong belief that you

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.940 
ingenuity and a strong belief that you
can<00:01:24.979> do<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:25.759> guarantee<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.409> can<00:01:27.649> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
can do this I guarantee that you can and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010 
can do this I guarantee that you can and
this<00:01:28.610> could<00:01:28.789> be<00:01:28.820> done<00:01:28.939> without<00:01:29.270> raising<00:01:29.899> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
this could be done without raising the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.179 
this could be done without raising the
cost<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.909> we<00:01:34.939> started<00:01:35.450> trenching<00:01:35.929> we<00:01:36.799> found<00:01:37.039> a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
cost so we started trenching we found a

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.520 
cost so we started trenching we found a
layer<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.520> concrete<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:38.539> course<00:01:38.600> underneath

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
layer of concrete of course underneath

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.190 
layer of concrete of course underneath
this<00:01:39.679> gravel<00:01:40.450> but<00:01:41.450> we're<00:01:41.600> able<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.840> make<00:01:41.990> some

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
this gravel but we're able to make some

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.149 
this gravel but we're able to make some
progress<00:01:42.350> through<00:01:42.829> here<00:01:43.009> as<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.310> see

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
progress through here as you can see

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.350 
progress through here as you can see
we'll<00:01:46.159> come<00:01:46.340> back<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.700> clean<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.030> trench

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
we'll come back and clean that trench

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.410 
we'll come back and clean that trench
out<00:01:47.569> we'll<00:01:48.289> be<00:01:48.319> ready<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.619> lay<00:01:48.709> our<00:01:48.830> pipe<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
out we'll be ready to lay our pipe the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.330 
out we'll be ready to lay our pipe the
trencher<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:50.840> doing<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.170> fine<00:01:51.380> job<00:01:51.409> of<00:01:52.009> slowly

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
trencher is doing a fine job of slowly

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.940 
trencher is doing a fine job of slowly
digging<00:01:52.909> through<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.330> concrete<00:01:53.740> once<00:01:54.740> we've

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
digging through that concrete once we've

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.370 
digging through that concrete once we've
completed<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.640> trench<00:01:55.970> we'll<00:01:56.599> remove<00:01:56.929> all<00:01:57.200> of

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
completed the trench we'll remove all of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.309 
completed the trench we'll remove all of
that<00:01:57.409> excess<00:01:58.189> soil<00:01:58.490> gravel<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.270> concrete<00:01:59.780> so

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
that excess soil gravel and concrete so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.559 
that excess soil gravel and concrete so
we<00:02:00.349> have<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> smooth<00:02:00.920> surface<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.640> put<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.299> top

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
we have a smooth surface to put that top

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.809 
we have a smooth surface to put that top
base<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:03.110> gravel<00:02:03.590> back<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.310> cover<00:02:04.729> the
