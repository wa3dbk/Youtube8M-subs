00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the arrow the other era when it's in a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
the arrow the other era when it's in a
tree<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.720> he<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:13.259> was<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> picking<00:01:14.250> cards<00:01:14.570> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
tree and he he was a picking cards and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.060 
tree and he he was a picking cards and
we<00:01:15.630> picked<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.899> card<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> he<00:01:16.530> asked<00:01:16.770> me<00:01:16.860> what

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
we picked a card and he asked me what

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.680 
we picked a card and he asked me what
was<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> car<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.460> matched<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.940> card<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
was the car that matched this card and I

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.820 
was the car that matched this card and I
think<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:18.930> showed<00:01:19.080> me<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.440> a<00:01:19.500> six<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
think he showed me it's like a six of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.060 
think he showed me it's like a six of
spades<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.460> six<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> clubs<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.890> obviously

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
spades or six of clubs and so obviously

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
spades or six of clubs and so obviously
natural<00:01:23.759> match<00:01:23.880> would<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.750> other<00:01:24.840> black

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
natural match would be the other black

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
natural match would be the other black
six<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.310> he<00:01:26.820> first<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.750> were<00:01:27.840> working<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
six so he first we were working with a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.570 
six so he first we were working with a
different<00:01:28.530> card<00:01:28.710> though<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.189> he<00:01:29.250> threw<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.490> up

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.789 
different card though and he threw it up
in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> air<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.869> mean<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.110> would<00:01:31.229> weigh<00:01:31.439> my

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
