 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.429
 I bring a news today gentlemen 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.250
 this is brought to me by the friend tommy 777 who 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 in the photo ethical shield and very well 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.490
 agree that a few days ago he spoke 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 with the people of mexico the people of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 Mexico 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 days ago 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
 we had talked a little about some 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.310
 details of the playstation 4 in which 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.310
 they were revealed in the journal psm3 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 in which I was in doubt that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.840
 simple there are four or whatever you call it was going to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.940
 read this game of play 3 not very well 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.879
 it seems that it will not support games of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.489
 playstation 3 the new playstation the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.750
 publication of psm 3 has unveiled new 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.089
 details of the new console 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.949
 sony desktop that would not be called 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.379
 playstation 4 as we all know 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.239
 according to the magazine the code name does not 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 is you go too, as we have 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.379
 heard a rumor 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 good a few days ago was what I reported 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 also good but it is orbis 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.549
 practically still with the code name 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520
 of orbis for playstation 4 in which 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.320
 it was talking about the year 2011 in addition 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 the new generation of sony consoles 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 would work with bluray would not support the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.869
 playstation 3 games or titles 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.689
 used and possibly will not go to a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.900
 4k resolution as they had claimed 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.909
 other rumors train would have a memory 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.439
 internal flash of 16 gb and it would cost good 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.680
 between about four hundred and fifth 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.470
 sterling not me I said 400 and 600 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.610
 dollars but here 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.380
 of sterling pounds good as everything 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.880
 this as everything is known so far not 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.250
 there is nothing official but if we are 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.710
 talking about psm3 magazine that the magazine 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.670
 official I think there's 90 percent 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.290
 of security no but already this would be a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.270
 issue aside talk about the used games 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.650
 because we talk about it many times but 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.150
 whenever I speak once they always come out 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.250
 other things informal or that the others 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.080
