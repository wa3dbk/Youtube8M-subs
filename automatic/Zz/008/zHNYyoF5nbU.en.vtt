00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 I will teach to play the song 19 days 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.610
 and 500 nights of joaquin sabina this is 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 my first video tutorial that is going to upload 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.950
 from joaquin sabina is a very public 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 select I am going to seem very cultured and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.970
 Well the truth seems to me a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.680
 excellent musician if not listened to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 songs of yours I recommend you 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 look for songs from him since he has a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 peculiar style of poetry that does not 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.320
 any artist can have it good 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 let's start with the song song 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 I'm going to make it look like a version 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.360
 to listen live what good I think 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.820
 which is a little more practical than it is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820
 the original version since here I could see 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.410
 the features and the chords they used 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.059
 to joaquin let's start with a fix 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.969
 what would this be what I'm going to do first 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.969
 slowly and then a little faster 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.629
 Y 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.770
 i 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.979
 or not 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.299
 and we will use the following 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 chords for what is the part of the 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.780
 stanza 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.150
 me 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 this variant of me 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.430
 I agreed that I have not found 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.890
 well the definition of how it would be so 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.970
 so as not to lie or cheat, I'm going to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.380
 to leave like this is played as if we play a re 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.020
 but a rope up and putting 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.980
 this finger on the first string in the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.980
 third fret 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.100
 F sharp minor 7 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.350
 yes 7a 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.870
 and seventh 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.470
 the least 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.170
 this chord also that is like a do 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.170
 but we had it that way the second fret 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.230
 and these are going to be the chords that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.970
 use strumming is something peculiar already 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.350
 that in the part of me uses the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.770
 variant that had told them 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.770
 previously 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.600
 and let's do the fast together with a 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.170
 variant the strum is going to be of 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.170
 this way 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.580
 ok this is going to be the quick one that's going to 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.530
 bring the whole song and now we are going 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.860
 to start with what would be the part of 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860
 the stanza 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.100
 after this we go back to doing the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.930
 arrangement that I taught them at the beginning and 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.750
 then comes what is part of the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.800
 choir how good this part is simple and 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.420
 that we're just going to use the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.420
 and we are going to do it this way 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.180
 good as they realize it's a song 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.670
 very peculiar the truth I liked it 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.410
 You have to practice strumming 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.530
 well I made them in a way 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.990
 simple but the strum itself is a 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.240
 little more fanned at hand that wants 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 say that we use the four fingers of 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.080
 our hand to do the fast 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.030
 practice first of the quick I gave them 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.700
 and then as they grab 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.410
 practice they can implement the trait that 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.020
 I tell them you already know that if you have doubts 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.580
