00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.310
 two 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.030
 hello how about in this video we're going to see 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.040
 how to root your galaxy s 6 either in the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.450
 edition version the normal version what 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.250
 let's do with a root ping pong what 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.779
 that you will not help increase the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.580
 Equinox counter therefore 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.320
 theoretically you would not harm your 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.240
 guarantee in a new case that the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.910
 require what it is that we have to 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.830
 do I'll show with Reuters 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.529
 this galaxy of 6 in question does not have 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.690
 root let's check rock says no 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.910
 that we do not have root then let's go 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 to the forum of x from a well-known among 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.199
 all android developers 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.629
 for cell phones where we find 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.239
 many trinkets between that is the one of 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.790
 ping pong root let's perform 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.780
 within the article to the section of 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.949
 the downloads 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.380
 It should be noted that you have to be 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.540
 registered to download 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.370
 and then we are going to download the most 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.020
 recent at this time is this the one 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.850
 we are seeing but maybe when you 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.040
 you see the video there is already a version 7 of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.790
 version 8 other 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.670
 well we download it starts to go down 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.230
 once you get off we're going to open it for 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 install it 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.300
 we are going to install you are going to ask 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.590
 if you are giving him some permissions 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.020
 special we say yes the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.020
 quarrel and we're ready to open 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.109
 it's going to open then it's going to install the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.829
 super your sun from the binary files 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.409
 of rock 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.020
 the process may take a little longer 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.700
 We open and start trying 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.229
 make a rock tradition you can not 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.020
 because you have not opened the super his ever 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.140
 we go to the main menu and open the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.250
 super your just installed shows up 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.439
 An ad we accept 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.900
 specifically back and opened her 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.030
 we click on root again 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.650
 and this time without any problem 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.650
 Must be able to flip the 16 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.710
 ready it was already that what we have to 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.710
 do now restart the cellphone ok 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.790
 once it finishes restarting I put a 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.299
 record the screen again we come to the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.299
 rut checkbook 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.280
 we click on verify root and we can 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.099
 observe that now we do have 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.620
 solicitations you are already a user with 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.620
 root this would be everything
