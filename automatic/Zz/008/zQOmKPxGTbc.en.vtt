the Sun it helps but one two three where

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.650 
the Sun it helps but one two three where
do<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.440> other<00:02:36.560> ones<00:02:36.769> for<00:02:37.099> yeah<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:37.940> one<00:02:38.330> see

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
do the other ones for yeah that one see

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.690 
do the other ones for yeah that one see
that<00:02:38.840> one<00:02:39.019> is<00:02:39.260> actually<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:40.099> actually<00:02:40.489> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
that one is actually just actually a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.770 
that one is actually just actually a
current

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
current

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.550 
current
so<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.590> really<00:02:43.890> hard<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.850> until<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.050> let

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
so it's really hard to see until you let

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.930 
so it's really hard to see until you let
them<00:02:46.710> just<00:02:47.010> drive<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> little<00:02:47.460> bit<00:02:47.670> there's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
them just drive a little bit there's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.810 
them just drive a little bit there's
another<00:02:48.150> one<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> bomb

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
another one it's a bomb

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.120 
another one it's a bomb
and<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.150> Senna<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.410> easy<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.860> meet

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and it's like Senna it's so easy to meet

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.500 
and it's like Senna it's so easy to meet
a<00:02:53.460> petite

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.259 

and<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.349> one<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.620> another<00:02:58.310> one<00:02:58.519> see<00:02:59.030> it's

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
and that one is another one see it's

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.729 
and that one is another one see it's
just<00:02:59.510> covered<00:02:59.750> with<00:03:00.019> dirt<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:01.360> okay<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.810> what

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
just covered with dirt and okay and what

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.789 
just covered with dirt and okay and what
is<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.069> easy<00:03:04.099> nummies<00:03:04.700> Oh<00:03:05.409> another<00:03:06.409> little

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
is so easy nummies Oh another little

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:16.119 
is so easy nummies Oh another little
chip<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:13.209> few<00:03:14.209> small<00:03:14.510> cutters<00:03:14.989> for<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.739> morning

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
chip a few small cutters for the morning

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.830 
chip a few small cutters for the morning
and<00:03:16.400> what<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.269> do

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
and what I do

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.320 
and what I do
of<00:03:17.989> course<00:03:18.319> preferably<00:03:18.769> with<00:03:19.010> gloves<00:03:19.280> see<00:03:20.150> one

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
of course preferably with gloves see one

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.089 
of course preferably with gloves see one
now<00:03:20.510> again<00:03:20.840> another<00:03:20.989> crystal<00:03:21.590> header<00:03:21.799> just

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
now again another crystal header just

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.360 
now again another crystal header just
pick<00:03:22.310> up<00:03:22.489> from<00:03:22.640> there<00:03:22.849> so<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.720> another

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
pick up from there so just another

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.360 
pick up from there so just another
crystal<00:03:25.370> here<00:03:28.180> what<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.299> do<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.920> just<00:03:31.190> wake

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
crystal here what I do is I just wake

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.920 
crystal here what I do is I just wake
him<00:03:31.400> through<00:03:31.849> but<00:03:32.030> before<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.360> construe<00:03:32.900> I

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
him through but before I construe I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.650 
him through but before I construe I
always<00:03:33.440> create<00:03:33.829> a<00:03:33.860> flat<00:03:34.430> surface<00:03:35.209> or<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.420> flat

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
always create a flat surface or a flat

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.650 
always create a flat surface or a flat
face<00:03:35.959> where<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.859> can<00:03:37.099> just<00:03:37.340> lay<00:03:37.489> them<00:03:37.730> out<00:03:37.879> that

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
face where I can just lay them out that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.580 
face where I can just lay them out that
way<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:39.440> can<00:03:39.650> easily<00:03:39.890> see<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.450> zircons<00:03:41.930> as

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
way you can easily see the zircons as

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.059 
way you can easily see the zircons as
you're<00:03:43.280> raking<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.879> down<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.450> also<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.890> get<00:03:46.010> a

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
you're raking it down and also you get a

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.830 
you're raking it down and also you get a
lot<00:03:46.129> of<00:03:46.370> appetites<00:03:46.940> here<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.629> whet<00:03:50.810> your

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
lot of appetites here just to whet your

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.619 
lot of appetites here just to whet your
appetite<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:52.220> appetite<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.060> when<00:03:53.480> they

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
appetite the appetite so when they

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.449 
appetite the appetite so when they
actually<00:03:53.810> fractured<00:03:54.500> off<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.069> find

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
actually fractured off like that I find

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.550 
actually fractured off like that I find
that<00:03:55.640> they're<00:03:55.819> much<00:03:55.970> better<00:03:56.269> then<00:03:56.870> collecting

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
that they're much better then collecting

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.400 
that they're much better then collecting
the<00:03:57.769> big<00:03:58.040> pieces<00:03:58.870> because<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.019> big<00:04:00.170> pieces

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
the big pieces because the big pieces

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.530 
the big pieces because the big pieces
you<00:04:00.650> still<00:04:00.859> have<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.069> take<00:04:01.220> it<00:04:01.370> home<00:04:01.549> and<00:04:01.849> crack

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
you still have to take it home and crack

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.539 
you still have to take it home and crack
them<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:03.200> get<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.470> crystals<00:04:03.950> out<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:04.220> them<00:04:04.400> or

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
them to get the crystals out of them or

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.789 
them to get the crystals out of them or
festival<00:04:05.209> once<00:04:05.419> more<00:04:05.750> clear<00:04:06.049> once<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.590> look

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
festival once more clear once and look

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.099 
festival once more clear once and look
what<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.040> found<00:04:07.069> just<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.090> big<00:04:08.419> crystal<00:04:08.930> head

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
what I found just a big crystal head

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.379 
what I found just a big crystal head
just<00:04:09.349> you're<00:04:09.470> sitting<00:04:09.769> here<00:04:09.889> look<00:04:10.130> at<00:04:10.220> that

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
just you're sitting here look at that

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.129 
just you're sitting here look at that
look<00:04:11.590> boom<00:04:12.590> crystal<00:04:13.340> hood<00:04:13.760> that's<00:04:14.599> an<00:04:14.810> example

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
look boom crystal hood that's an example

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.000 
look boom crystal hood that's an example
it<00:04:15.590> comes<00:04:15.919> up<00:04:16.130> there<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.370> went<00:04:16.729> it's<00:04:16.849> pleased

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
it comes up there I went it's pleased

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.440 
it comes up there I went it's pleased
but<00:04:19.010> so<00:04:19.220> far<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> sturdy<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.180> that's<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
but so far the sturdy so that's the

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.140 
but so far the sturdy so that's the
crystal<00:04:20.870> bombs<00:04:21.220> okay<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.639> better<00:04:22.880> put<00:04:23.060> the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
crystal bombs okay I better put the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.779 
crystal bombs okay I better put the
camera<00:04:23.479> down<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:24.169> do<00:04:24.800> some<00:04:24.979> more<00:04:25.160> working<00:04:25.460> on

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
camera down and do some more working on

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.600 
camera down and do some more working on
just<00:04:26.030> got<00:04:26.180> me<00:04:26.300> excited<00:04:26.560> again<00:04:27.560> okay<00:04:27.979> see<00:04:28.310> just

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
just got me excited again okay see just

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.390 
just got me excited again okay see just
sitting<00:04:28.940> here<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:29.270> top<00:04:29.620> they're<00:04:30.620> really<00:04:31.130> hard

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
sitting here on top they're really hard

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.310 
sitting here on top they're really hard
to<00:04:31.520> see<00:04:31.820> even<00:04:31.849> when<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.479> wash<00:04:32.780> them<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.260> you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
to see even when you wash them so you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.219 
to see even when you wash them so you
have<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.740> let<00:04:33.919> them<00:04:34.130> dry<00:04:34.460> up<00:04:34.700> first<00:04:35.120> before<00:04:35.870> you

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
have to let them dry up first before you

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.020 
have to let them dry up first before you
actually<00:04:36.650> pick<00:04:36.919> them<00:04:37.160> so<00:04:37.400> there's<00:04:37.669> obvious

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
actually pick them so there's obvious

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.180 
actually pick them so there's obvious
ones<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.389> course<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:38.960> can<00:04:39.139> pick<00:04:39.380> after

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
ones of course that you can pick after

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.390 
ones of course that you can pick after
washing<00:04:40.669> them<00:04:40.849> but<00:04:41.599> most<00:04:42.289> of<00:04:42.530> them<00:04:42.770> unless<00:04:43.070> you

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
washing them but most of them unless you

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.300 
washing them but most of them unless you
dry<00:04:43.849> them<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.330> can't<00:04:44.599> see<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.710> zircon<00:04:46.130> so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
dry them you can't see the zircon so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.890 
dry them you can't see the zircon so
this<00:04:46.460> one's<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.820> good<00:04:46.970> example<00:04:47.300> against<00:04:47.750> with

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
this one's a good example against with

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.800 
this one's a good example against with
this<00:04:48.020> one<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.410> they<00:04:48.560> miss<00:04:49.300> see<00:04:50.300> if<00:04:50.510> we<00:04:50.630> can

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
this one that they miss see if we can

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.290 
this one that they miss see if we can
find<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.200> lot<00:04:51.349> okay<00:04:51.620> here<00:04:51.889> another<00:04:52.099> one

you can go through other people's
Amalekites<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:32.150> piles<00:05:32.450> that<00:05:32.810> someone<00:05:33.200> else

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
Amalekites the piles that someone else

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.080 
Amalekites the piles that someone else
has<00:05:33.560> worked<00:05:33.740> on<00:05:33.980> as<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.490> see<00:05:34.700> there's

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
has worked on as you can see there's

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.230

I<00:05:39.080> tend<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.670> find<00:05:40.670> them<00:05:41.120> on<00:05:41.330> top<00:05:41.690> just<00:05:41.900> sitting

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
I tend to find them on top just sitting

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.260 
I tend to find them on top just sitting
on<00:05:42.320> top<00:05:42.560> because<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:43.010> exposes<00:05:43.460> them<00:05:43.850> it<00:05:44.000> cleans

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
on top because it exposes them it cleans

00:05:44.270 --> 00:06:29.770 
on top because it exposes them it cleans
the<00:05:44.390> dirt<00:05:44.600> off<00:05:44.870> them<00:05:45.140> you're<00:05:45.950> not<00:05:46.040> a<00:05:46.100> big<00:05:46.310> pasta
