00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:20.220
 designed and the videos and the clicks and one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.240
 has walked enough like that we will land 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 here in case you all have the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.640
 short memory 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 the booklet of the hi everyone 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.250
 it's mister melon I hope you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 go all very well in any case me that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 is going to say that she is today we are 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 found for a new video on the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.070
 zombie on the map buried is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 today I will show you 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 how do you activate the music I'm going 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 show you how draws weapons 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 on the wall and how to make sure that the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 monster actually he has in the map you 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.980
 help kill the enemies so we go 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.690
 immediately started with the music 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 so to start you kill the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 some zombies case there you fall in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 the hole and there you already hear the little 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.530
 noise of the music so in fact it takes 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.820
 find teddy bear in the map 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.289
 so I immediately show you where 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.579
 is the first one after drinking that he 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.260
 work the first teddy bear he gets 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.549
 just find here so he was not 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 very hard to find apart from the fact 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.159
 that he is really in the dark so his 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.570
 shows to see it but we hear it very 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.530
 easily when we go down so that's it 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 in addition we are obliged to go down by 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.799
 there we can not miss it 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.090
 I'll go straight to 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.549
 the second round am here that I have the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 more galley to find so that's it then 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.159
 I want to clarify that I looked 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.299
 no video to introduce you all 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.880
 the stuff that I present to you in 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 zombies since since yesterday so I 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.610
 made three videos on the zombie is safe 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.210
 the three videos I did not watch anything 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.590
 on the Internet 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.520
 I really discovered everything by myself 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.439
 even that's why I'm pretty 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 proud then there for the teddy that 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.290
 relieve them looking because I 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 heard it but I found him not 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 gesti sift is not hidden at all and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 I have so much trouble so the device I 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.970
 do a little black screen proves for 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 switch to the last teddy so the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.200
 last teddy bear it is necessary to break the door 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.140
 with the big gentleman to know 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 how to use it you look at my 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.049
 first video on the zombie where 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.350
 I explain simply how he 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.710
 must do 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.000
 so here I am going to head into the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 house and I also found them great 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.700
 easily he's right here in the corner 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.530
 what when we get back into the house we 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.030
 the direct hearing and so I'm going to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 shut up and I'll let you listen to the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.870
 music for about noon 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 go on 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.920
 joined right after 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.220
 sow 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 at 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.790
 at 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.790
 when 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.719
 this is good for music 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.099
 now you know how to activate 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.719
 I will now show you how 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.890
 we draw the weapons to draw the 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.780
 weapons it's very simple just 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.069
 picking up art drawings would be lacking and 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.150
 to redraw them on the points 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.099
 questioning so it's really 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.209
 super easy and in addition you do not win 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.799
 bad money see it I won 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.719
 2000 points to draw an old thing 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.310
 on the wall so it's pretty stylish I 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.269
 will show you where I 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.530
 can draw others 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.730
 in the meantime I make you a little 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.870
 parenthesis on the music just because 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.909
 that I could not speak while 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 while she's playing and you can see 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.870
 that she is pretty average I find 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.859
 finally the beginning is super slow after 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.000
 when there is the remera I love you I 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.159
 you hate whole families I you 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.599
 put the beginning and the chorus the chorus 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.650
 is he liked the slow enough start and 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.480
 as you could see it's 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.159
 still a woman's voice singing I 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.959
 noticed that almost all videos 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.250
 if all videos all music 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.930
 maybe even all the music I 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.069
 do not know it's almost always a 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.079
 girl's voice so that I find it quite 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.090
 fun and it's still a style a 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.189
 little I do not know I do not know how that 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.299
 is called the music style I did not 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.579
 not want to say nap after doing it 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.019
 to insult but but here it is always 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.939
 a little bit in the same style 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.609
 so that's it I leave you I wanted 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.810
 still tell it what am I going 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.070
 to say other opinions the kinematics of the 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.150
 early I did not leave it simply 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.680
 because it's not interesting from 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.820
 everything they do that say yeah we have to 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.889
 gets closer to the fault that's the end 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.180
 of the world you will listen to me nana so 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.620
 that's why I did not want to leave 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.909
 one for the frustrated from the beginning who gets 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.830
 say ah you want to see more 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.940
 you can search the internet if 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.139
 you want but there she has nothing 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.099
 really interesting to compare to that 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.320
 to say is that they were not bad 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.130
 still where there were quite a few attacked 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.599
 I noticed that they like to do well 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.789
 close- ups of the girl's breasts 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.930
 good after I say that I say nothing but the 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.430
 three quarters of the cinematic is that 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.630
 on l so that's if you're interested 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.630
 to go see her I have for that you 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.580
 can go there so here is I 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.990
 so say in the third weapon that I have 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.190
 found I buy it to show you 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.960
 so here we can buy the weapons without 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.250
 worry it's the three locations that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.419
 I use the most after there are others 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.740
 just look for them with the trump 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.120
 phoenix so to find them there are 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.680
 just a little cross on the map it's 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.849
 not complicated and I show you everything from 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.380
 following the third part of the video 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.610
 which consists of giving sweets to 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.439
 time to the species of 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.759
 my ski with you we could see him 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.780
 give drink to kick ass the walls 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.979
 but we can also give him some 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.900
 sweets and there you go see he's going 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.250
 completely farted a lead and starts to 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.289
 banging in front of him to put blows of 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.610
 taffarel foot frankly the first 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.810
 view the first time I saw that I 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.460
 he was too scared he wants what he's talking about 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.810
 you actually I told myself oh that late 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.949
 they will fool me in the mouth so I 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.090
 book shoot him and actually when 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.680
 you shoot him it scares him 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.210
 and he hides in his house do not need 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.080
 not shoot him in fact he comes to 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.819
 next to you but it's for you 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.830
 protect if you stop running he goes 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.300
 stop it will kick around you but 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.860
 not on you so I noticed there too 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 it was a little bug of maps every 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.830
 zombies goes up where I do not know why 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.060
 So here is like seeing a table 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.439
 points they smash all the zombies the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.560
 gemmi slowed down because he's going to put in 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.060
 kick huge boom alger so much fun 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.919
 during the video as I saw what he 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.330
 put 1 that made me laugh so 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.650
 this is actually it's you in front of it's 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.060
 obviously not an infinite duration 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.439
 there you will see it going soon 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.610
 stop but you're still fine 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.050
 and it's pretty funny to watch what 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.039
 sometimes he taps into the wind they 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.569
 leave anyway but sometimes he puts 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.159
 quite huge potatoes 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.330
 and there you could see that I got 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.620
 even did it block it saved my life 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.449
 so it's still not a church 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.889
 it's something rather useful so 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.330
 that's it before you finish this 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.860
 video i want to thank mini 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.629

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.339
 background I would put his channel in the
