00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.850
 Nicole and Felix want to have a look today 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 dedicated to the classic of water sports 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 and have become a first sailing course 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.350
 on a small lake date 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.070
 sergeant rüdiger explains the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.110
 Basic concepts based on the small dinghy 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.149
 and also shows how to do the shaky 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.600
 rightly enter the ship without entering 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.600
 to fall water 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.950
 then follow the main moves 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.590
 and rüdiger dismisses the two to a 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.050
 first day of practice on the water basis 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.210
 Sailing alone is a sailing course 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.660

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.399
 300 euros cost this course want the 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.590
 both during their next vacation 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.800
 Be sure to visit them safely 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.899
 This deal will be offered at ten 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.300
 light sailboat with the rollable 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.399
 schwert lets them sail and sport 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.929
 responds to the smallest stage or tax 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.459
 movements of nicole as a dancer can 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.530
 easy on a trailer with the 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.530
 bring car in always new territory 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.630
 try back on the jetty has rüdiger 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.720
 a surprise for the two sails 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.789
 beginner ready his friend carsten takes 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.869
 on board a sailing yacht 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.239
 open sea beyond 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.650
 a secret dream of the two I have 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.430
 I still respect the room 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:27.959
 in my head I get hope that our 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.959
 skipper and everything explained 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.180
 the most important differences are pending 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.910
 had 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.420
 while rotating freely back but it reacts 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.370
 delayed 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.800
 you had with the joola that the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.930
 We did not need to lift the sails 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.760
 rolled up that means we have 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.560
 that the foresail to us suggest 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 Wrapped with it just unrolled 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.140
 this works automatically with automatic 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.390
 muscle power rhön such a hunt is already 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.510
 impressive and demands the whole 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.770
 man or woman okay there I would say 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.190
 the gema underneath the west rausgelegt that 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.190
 is working 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.170
 Under the guidance of the skipper 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.760
 first set the sail 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 then both are allowed to row the oar 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.660
 take over 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.570
 now you can feel how strong the forces are 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.730
 throw from wind and waves 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.930
 but nicole and felix will join us 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.340
 rewarded with a completely new nature experience 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.740
 in principle, only the word applies on board 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.990
 the captain's also know nicole and that 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.940
 felix for clear instructions and 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.350
 Quick decisions are necessary 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.350
 to control a yacht safely 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:26.900
 on the high seas, sailing at sea the most 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.760
 we could go down this page 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.830
 for a call and felix for days 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.990
 go ahead and they use the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.040
 possibility of your powers with wind water 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.450
 and to measure waves 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.450
 until the evening off
