00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.850 
in the microwave 1.5 release so yeah we
can<00:00:09.420> do<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.870> basically<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.740> hot

show you how to make a trap chest so I'm
gonna<00:00:15.870> go<00:00:15.960> into<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> carbon<00:00:16.379> signal<00:00:16.590> now<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
gonna go into the carbon signal now and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560 
gonna go into the carbon signal now and
we'll<00:00:17.070> show<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> recipes<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.880> these<00:00:18.029> so

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
we'll show you the recipes of these so

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.790 
we'll show you the recipes of these so
to<00:00:18.630> make<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.990> hopper<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.350> you're<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
to make the hopper which you're going to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.170 
to make the hopper which you're going to
need<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> may<00:00:20.100> need<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> few<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.880> gonna<00:00:21.060> do

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
need you may need a few of you gonna do

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
need you may need a few of you gonna do
this<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> hopper<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.010> this

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
this a lot so you get a hopper like this

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.890 
this a lot so you get a hopper like this
that's<00:00:23.670> how<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.820> craft<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.090> hopper<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.510> then

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
that's how you craft a hopper and then

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's how you craft a hopper and then
if<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.439> craft<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.890> trap<00:00:26.250> chest<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> bit

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
if you want to craft a trap chest a bit

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.040 
if you want to craft a trap chest a bit
of<00:00:26.760> chest<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.090> middle<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.480> trip<00:00:27.869> wire

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
of chest in the middle and trip wire

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.839 
of chest in the middle and trip wire
hook<00:00:28.230> by<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.439> side<00:00:28.859> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.730> what

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
hook by the side if you know what

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
hook by the side if you know what
trapped<00:00:30.449> chest<00:00:30.689> does<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.289> put<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> down<00:00:31.679> once

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
trapped chest does you put it down once

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.959 
trapped chest does you put it down once
you<00:00:32.099> right-click<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> looks<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> normal

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you right-click it looks like a normal

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.330 
you right-click it looks like a normal
chest<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.750> works<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.079> an<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.350> chest<00:00:34.590> however

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
chest it works like an all chest however

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.069 
chest it works like an all chest however
if<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.969> put<00:00:36.149> teams<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.719> anywhere<00:00:37.020> around

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
if you put teams he like anywhere around

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.810 
if you put teams he like anywhere around
it<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:37.980> block<00:00:38.129> away<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it like if it was one block away and I

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
it like if it was one block away and I
opened<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:39.420> blow<00:00:39.570> ups<00:00:39.750> basically<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
opened it it would blow ups basically it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
opened it it would blow ups basically it
gives<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.040> one-block<00:00:41.700> signal<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.690> redstone

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
gives off a one-block signal of redstone

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
gives off a one-block signal of redstone
so<00:00:43.379> yeah<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:44.850> demonstration<00:00:45.390> room

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so yeah so this is my demonstration room

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.310 
so yeah so this is my demonstration room
that's<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.750> i'm<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:45.989> showing<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.289> how

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that's what i'm gonna be showing you how

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
that's what i'm gonna be showing you how
to<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.309> chest<00:00:47.579> isn't<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.030> trap<00:00:48.300> when

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to do it so this chest isn't a trap when

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.479 
to do it so this chest isn't a trap when
an<00:00:48.899> obviously<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.469> good<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.739> TNT<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.430> if

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
an obviously as good as TNT there but if

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
an obviously as good as TNT there but if
you<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> server<00:00:51.000> which<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:51.809> likely

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you want a server which is more likely

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.939 
you want a server which is more likely
what<00:00:52.199> you're<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.530> doing<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.710> for

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
what you're going to be doing this for

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
what you're going to be doing this for
and<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.850> hidden<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.390> they'd

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and it will be like hidden like they'd

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.729 
and it will be like hidden like they'd
put<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.840> under<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.140> block<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.410> something<00:00:55.680> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
put it under the block or something like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
put it under the block or something like
that<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.309> anyway<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.730> we're<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that but anyway so we're gonna do is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.209 
that but anyway so we're gonna do is
basically<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.230> destroy<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.649> blocks<00:00:59.010> here

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
basically just destroy the blocks here

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.040 
basically just destroy the blocks here
so<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> book<00:01:00.180> under<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> chest<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so you have the book under the chest and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.180 
so you have the book under the chest and
while<00:01:01.500> i'm<00:01:01.590> doing<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.800> by<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> way<00:01:02.039> guys

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
this you just gonna put a hopper under

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the chest and then you probably guessed

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
the chest and then you probably guessed
already<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> items<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> chest<00:01:11.280> are

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
