00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740 
starch and I always cook with our
electric<00:00:38.100> rice<00:00:38.250> cooker<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:39.180> life's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.629> lot

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
easier if you do this I think every

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.549 
easier if you do this I think every
Asian<00:00:42.780> family<00:00:43.140> has<00:00:43.320> one<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:45.289> lot<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> other

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
Asian family has one a lot of other
family<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.910> Asian

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
family don't have one and the Asian

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
family don't have one and the Asian
family<00:00:48.539> eat<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.989> rice<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.230> anybody<00:00:49.680> else

you never put the food one the first one

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.250 
you never put the food one the first one
