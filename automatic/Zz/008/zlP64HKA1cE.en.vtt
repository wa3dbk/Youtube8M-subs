00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.710
 hello this time we are going to make a 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.100
 ballet dancer in jumping pose 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.290
 ok what we are going to do is make a 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.470
 collage first a line that is going to 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.760
 help with the general form is going to be a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.760
 curve expand 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.930
 and from here we can go drawing 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.970
 well what we have is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.970
 to be one as you see 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.150
 and what to do as rancor 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.900
 and here we are going to do a lot of Chinese 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.820
 A) Yes 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:52.910
 very very open 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.940
 and join the ends of each ball 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.970
 towards the chest or this area that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.030
 towards the torso like this 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:10.229
 here some also inwards go 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.229
 as well as if it was a harlequin neck 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.740
 after here we will take out one leg 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 very thin here we will do as a 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.400
 triangular 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.600
 here we give a curve and turned 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.729
 or the leg here is where he does knee 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.729
 and there is love 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.750
 so here we are the long time and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 thin 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.270
 A) Yes 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.710
 what it is to be the short shoe there 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 and some crosses 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.500
 well that way 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.860
 is the ribbon with which they are tied 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.570
 the shoes a crusade like that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.360
 if it's good that it takes the leap towards 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.179
 here then we are going to do here as a 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:13.270
 bun makes a few ribbons like this 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.270
 rectangles and is being so is flown 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.349
 that the movement takes 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.190
 and here where is where the rest of 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.190
 your suit can bring a curvita 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 and then what if the samur is here 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.819
 is the knee and a curve very very 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.170
 entry 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.170
 So is the instep 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.500
 and what are we going to do the shoe 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.140
 as it is seen from below a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 plant and there is the bottom part of the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.069
 shoe 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.319
 we are a line there 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.549
 equal crosses 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.549
 very inclined 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.950
 here the one that knots the leg is 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.380
 it took off from here to here then the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.410
 chignon falls 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.190
 towards here 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.770
 as strongly then so some 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.780
 fast lines 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.780
 now what we are going to do 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.090
 two peaks 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.790
 is to bring a hand we are going to do so 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.879
 like the armpit and a little curve and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 then the rectum and something open so a 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.880
 very smooth curve that 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.750
 that is straight 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.410
 and very close together 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.100
 here is the hand we are going to do as well as 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.400
 nothing more that figure as well as a nugget 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.370
 and maybe the armpit line 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.680
 here comes the neck here 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.430
 is the face follows the line as well as 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.560
 if it was the column or something like that is not so 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.260
 technical the matter but if nothing matters 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.770
 more take the sequence there 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.210
 let's simulate here your hair like that with 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.020
 this figure as we want we are going to 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.870
 remarcar with pen and we have here a 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.990
 very big chongo 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.710
 in the lines to simulate the hair the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.040
 shine and the other arm extends towards 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.380
 here 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.190
 we do not have or if we make the shoulder this 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.500
 it's the armpit 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.500
 so we bring the thin arm 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.680
 and the palm like that 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.490
 as if he were in our position 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.410
 and here we carry the hollow of the armpit 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.360
 his whole face is hidden behind 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.320
 his arm so nothing museums there is a 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.220
 eyebrow sign of the eye maybe 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.220
 mouth 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.410
 and we have the movement 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.160
 very extended here we are going to 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.160
 highlight with 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.360
 the lung 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.290
 delgadito 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.419
 now we erase pencil lines 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.260
 and well, there we have already cleaned the 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.260
 drawing 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.099
 I just wanted to add color or leave 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.099
 well in shadows or as easy
