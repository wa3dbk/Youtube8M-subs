00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
what I was just saying about this one

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.779 
what I was just saying about this one
the<00:02:05.790> water<00:02:06.060> proof<00:02:06.649> receiver<00:02:07.649> box

and we also have these plugs here which

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.089 
and we also have these plugs here which
are<00:02:11.519> much<00:02:11.700> nicer<00:02:12.080> than<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> deans<00:02:13.440> ones<00:02:13.799> which

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
are much nicer than the deans ones which

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.970 
are much nicer than the deans ones which
can<00:02:14.370> sometimes<00:02:14.640> overheat<00:02:15.390> occasionally<00:02:16.049> we

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
can sometimes overheat occasionally we

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
fan raid large fan on the motor here to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.920 
fan raid large fan on the motor here to
keep<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.920> motor<00:02:26.099> cool<00:02:26.430> which<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.970> guess<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
keep the motor cool which I guess is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.660 
keep the motor cool which I guess is
going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.230> be<00:02:28.319> needed<00:02:28.709> what<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.549> this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
going to be needed what with this

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.770 
going to be needed what with this
