in
the<00:04:20.139> star<00:04:21.139> of<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.500> other<00:04:21.739> one<00:04:21.910> make<00:04:22.910> sense<00:04:23.150> but

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
the star of the other one make sense but

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.920 
the star of the other one make sense but
hopefully<00:04:25.250> with<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.520> footage<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:26.600> get<00:04:26.780> my

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
hopefully with this footage you get my

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.230 
hopefully with this footage you get my
face<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.740> didn't<00:04:28.460> do<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.610> very<00:04:28.760> good<00:04:28.850> job<00:04:28.970> of

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
face I didn't do a very good job of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.760 
face I didn't do a very good job of
hiding<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.630> pins<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.930> first<00:04:30.169> time<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.410> did<00:04:30.650> it

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
hiding the pins the first time I did it

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.500 
hiding the pins the first time I did it
but<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.280> more<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.639> do<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:31.970> easier<00:04:32.120> it

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
but the more you do it the easier it

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.129 
but the more you do it the easier it
becomes

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
becomes

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.870 
becomes
now<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:33.830> can<00:04:34.100> leave<00:04:34.250> these<00:04:34.430> little<00:04:34.610> bits

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
now you can leave these little bits

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.090 
now you can leave these little bits
straight<00:04:35.240> if<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:35.450> want<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.500> can<00:04:36.710> pull<00:04:36.950> it

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
straight if you want to you can pull it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.379 
straight if you want to you can pull it
out<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.490> can<00:04:37.669> make<00:04:37.790> it<00:04:37.910> look<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.120> bit<00:04:38.270> more

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
out you can make it look a bit more

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.930 
out you can make it look a bit more
messy<00:04:38.660> if<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.110> want<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.950> quite<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:40.760> how

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
messy if you want to I quite like how

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.640 
messy if you want to I quite like how
mine<00:04:41.180> looks<00:04:41.389> today<00:04:41.660> although<00:04:42.050> sometimes<00:04:42.410> I

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
mine looks today although sometimes I

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.080 
mine looks today although sometimes I
think<00:04:42.770> it's<00:04:42.950> quite<00:04:43.070> nice<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.580> make<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.850> plots

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
think it's quite nice to make the plots

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.200 
think it's quite nice to make the plots
look<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.419> bit<00:04:44.570> wider<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:46.490> also<00:04:46.700> do<00:04:47.030> that

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
look a bit wider you can also do that

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.030 
look a bit wider you can also do that
