00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.189
 let's play monster legends with one 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 closed conflict or that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.030
 calf em yes today always have once 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.320
 again a test namely of ours 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.270
 good obis so the mmo more serious so 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.930
 I do not know how exactly 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 monster monster does not pronounce 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.910
 idea 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 it's at least pretty cool his 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 So first I'll go straight away 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.980
 the rounds through here 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.739
 I have a strength rhone ranks pure 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 speed level three and one 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.539
 strength level 3 on it packed with it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.809
 is a bit faster and a bit faster 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.420
 more strikes 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.789
 the skills robbers so currently I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 maybe it will change something 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.890
 Robber beat fails moderately dark 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 then harm the goal then live three 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.930
 Target's target steals the target 30 percent 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.590
 Experience has a cooldown is very 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.540
 horny with really strong monsters exactly 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.630
 I want to be able to see if the whole life 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.610
 are or the lives he still has so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.470
 30 percent of the life he still has 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.580
 or 30 percent of his total 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 live because of the total live 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.960
 would be pretty okay then we have the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 Hijacking blow causes serious 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.729
 dark damage steals the target life 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 has a cooldown and that mmo 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.320
 broadsword adds an opponent moderate 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.750
 Special damage can be done at all goals 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.180
 Nightmares fail has a cooldown 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.439
 currently he is only at level 60 me 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.590
 would like to go a bit further 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.960
 but right now I am me too 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.110
 even though I have no 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.090
 Worker and can the dark temple there 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 unfortunately not upgrade because of that would have 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.790
 now with a level sixty vorlieb 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.790
 to take 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:11.550
 and as you can see, there is a new island 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:13.230
 So here the flora is the agony for 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.870
 made me because of me 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.140
 time not so much time 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.390
 I would say with a 60s 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.590
 Should we still go below 100? 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:31.019
 Let's see, we'll have a look 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:35.450
 here's the 70 on what it can do it 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:40.459
 several waves not so good 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.459
 and here we have a memorial of 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.459
 debug 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.799
 Here goes all get away away away away, 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.480
 a rendezvous 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.060
 you can also get a name again 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.280
 choose for him because I think you are 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.989
 not to attend 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.349
 you can just write something 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.859
 robber beat that stands for them 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.200
 Life 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:14.900
 First I want that and where is the 3ds 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:21.470
 likes is the 30 percent experience 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.829
 ok let's see if that's him yet 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.660
 This does not really help 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:33.120
 So now it has him now 30 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:37.889
 percent that is now 3000 2800 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.870
 so he has pulled him 2800 he 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:45.299
 we would try the mmo broadsword 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:52.220
 it's raining from the bottom pulls in the energy and 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:55.670
 he gets nightmares good to know 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.860
 robber strike for the frame exactly 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.200
 is in life there he has pressure once 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.660
 see the half article and there that me 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.680
 healed again 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:11.480
 he missed that too 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:15.940
 abduction beat subcutaneous then he too 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.940
 shut up again and steal his life 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.230
 then we'll ask you out there again 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:28.580
 I just wanna see what 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:31.280
 happens for example if I am now 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.220
 make him harm before and then the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.850
 Doing three of the leak on it when I get it 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.920
 now so many here to be at 5,400 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:46.160
 Now he is normally 2800 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:53.660
 make a mistake if it is from his 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:54.760
 live total 100 starts has he 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.970
 before 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:03.830
 I think that's really percentage 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.919
 Of course, pretty much of the whole life 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.330
 cool what is not so horny that me 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.610
 to be written to again and again 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.380
 I thought so should I 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.250
 switch off now 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.870
 my facebook or not i have it 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.960
 not done and I already regret it 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.510
 again 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.990
 but now let's go first here 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.180
 pvp since I have no time for now 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.930
 I want to chat this video now 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:39.100
 First of all let's pack in 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:42.080
 hama and horn then anubis pure 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:47.650
 We will pack that between completely 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.650
 but how can we do that? 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.970
 no, no 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:02.560
 a honest that looks better 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:06.610
 So let's make it clear here in here 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.110
 holy water on such a cookie on him 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.870
 because that does not bring much because I 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.110
 30 percentage attack on top of him 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.220
 wants to do and there it does not bring 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.270
 Somehow somehow somewhere someday 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.770
 what to do 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.139
 do not forget to subscribe 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:30.460
 forgot we understood each other there 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.080
 no fun that she sees the multi 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.139
 so you go out here on the 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:41.400
 youtube channel or download that and then 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:46.050
 Subscribe to it and it'll work out okay 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:50.740
 what has brought me this now fries them 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:59.320
 Damage confusion stunned why is there 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:00.360
 because real oh that's cool that's yes 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.630
 hot 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.860
 the multi is really bad, I know 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.740
 not if he 's and now 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.130
 but have understood the ultimate of 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.289
 he then attacks his very own 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:18.400
 it does more harm and so does his 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:22.599
 own people to that is very bad 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.270
 right now we are building three discs 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:31.139
 the fact you get now three of 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:37.539
 is lyc die and from what I've heard 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:40.360
 the mmo us synonymous of a youtuber 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:41.490
 been made and named after him 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.500
 been 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.590
 I'll see if I can see him 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.840
 somehow find and you there more 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.700
 can tell about it i think that 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.370
 Most will know that for the 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.960
 who do not know it now know it 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.729
 then I would also say what that 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.800
 with the an test if you like it 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:02.080
 Last has a thumb or an abo 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.580
 if you have suggestions for improvement 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.370
 can you like this in the comments 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.169
 I write everything and then I would write 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.039
 I'll tell you next time 

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.039
