believable we are working on this car we

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.150 
believable we are working on this car we
really<00:01:45.459> got<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.700> take<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.360> form<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:47.140> pull<00:01:47.920> it

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
really got to take that form and pull it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.529 
really got to take that form and pull it
and<00:01:48.310> stretch<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.789> in<00:01:49.090> different<00:01:49.269> directions

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
and stretch it in different directions

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.639 
and stretch it in different directions
to<00:01:50.050> try<00:01:50.349> to<00:01:50.410> emphasize<00:01:51.369> these<00:01:52.110> large<00:01:53.110> fenders

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
to try to emphasize these large fenders

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.160 
to try to emphasize these large fenders

model but special his project CAD data
is<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> final<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.929> we<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.680> make<00:02:11.709> sure<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
is the final so we have to make sure the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.910 
is the final so we have to make sure the
cat<00:02:12.610> data<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.000> looks<00:02:13.180> beautiful<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.349> perfect

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
cat data it looks beautiful and perfect

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
cat data it looks beautiful and perfect
and<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.819> did<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:18.099> biggest<00:02:18.280> challenge<00:02:18.790> in

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and we did it the biggest challenge in

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.570 
and we did it the biggest challenge in
designing<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.480> vision<00:02:19.720> GT<00:02:20.050> car<00:02:20.319> was<00:02:20.620> keeping

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
designing the vision GT car was keeping

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.140 
designing the vision GT car was keeping
the<00:02:21.940> spirit<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.420> ft<00:02:22.780> one<00:02:23.019> intact<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:24.700> changed<00:02:25.060> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the spirit of ft one intact we changed a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.710 
the spirit of ft one intact we changed a
lot<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.659> I<00:02:26.590> think<00:02:26.830> all<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.629> enthusiasts<00:02:28.629> out

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
lot and I think all the enthusiasts out

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.540 
lot and I think all the enthusiasts out
there<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.590> people<00:02:30.400> that

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
there and they have the people that

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.820 
there and they have the people that
loved<00:02:30.819> ft<00:02:31.330> 1<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:32.019> now<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.319> see<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.680> vision

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
loved ft 1 and now they see the vision

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
loved ft 1 and now they see the vision
GT<00:02:33.280> car<00:02:33.550> them<00:02:33.790> they'll<00:02:34.180> recognize<00:02:34.840> all<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
GT car them they'll recognize all the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.720 
GT car them they'll recognize all the
areas<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.590> change<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.190> lot<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.610> we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
areas we change and it's a lot so we

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.110 
areas we change and it's a lot so we
have<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.379> keep<00:02:38.379> keep<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.920> identity<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.489> ft<00:02:39.879> 1

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
have to keep keep the identity of ft 1

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.440 
have to keep keep the identity of ft 1
while<00:02:40.540> doing<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.819> we<00:02:43.060> put<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.269> lot<00:02:43.330> of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
while doing that and we put a lot of

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.110 
while doing that and we put a lot of
effort<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> lot<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.319> energy<00:02:44.580> into<00:02:45.580> really

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
effort a lot of energy into really

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.540 
effort a lot of energy into really
making<00:02:46.510> something<00:02:46.810> authentic

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
making something authentic

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.030 
making something authentic
that<00:02:48.360> when<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.140> race<00:02:49.380> fans<00:02:49.710> out<00:02:50.010> there

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
that when all the race fans out there

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.160

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
and all the Toyota driving fans out

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250 
and all the Toyota driving fans out
there<00:02:52.730> experience<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.880> car<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.390> gt6<00:02:54.720> they're
