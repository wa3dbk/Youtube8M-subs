00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 freight trains I have of passengers fought the same rails on the way to 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 Santos the biggest Brazilian port the result is delays I was not 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.579
 nor what harms the economy of the whole country 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.779
 the story is really the crowd 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.029
 70 coaches forget 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.089
 thousand tons of corn and sugar for export 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.669
 Sao Paulo 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.669
 also left drunk and goes to the field 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.319
 about 400 kilometers 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.339
 what could be done in 16 hours in europe doing this to the leader to 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.930
 first passenger station 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.310
 travel purpose 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.659
 from this point forward 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.019
 within the São Paulo metropolitan area, the rail network is one of the 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.739
 freight trains and passenger trains run on the same ideas 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.780
 the freight trains that can be parked waiting for the times at which it is 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.570
 follow travel possible 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.190
 and cross São Paulo 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.229
 because of the great movement of lucky passengers 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.600
 two time windows to load pass 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.700
 at nine in the morning at three in the afternoon and nine in the evening at three in the morning 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 the coexistence of loads and passengers on the same lines creates another problem is 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I need to reduce the damage 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.160
 this security issue 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.790
 carney can not have a size that threatens air transport safety 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.210
 the benfica returns on day 15 sometimes one at first with the stop so the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.170
 patterns are divided 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.730
 which was common also that 70 wagons turns 43 and the maximum victim of the state 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.820
 We boarded one of them. 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.409
 because of disassembly and restricted hours, that part of the load only comes out of 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.630
 jundiaí 19 hours after arriving 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.120
 it's nine in the morning 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.220
 the secular block 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.469
 ten minutes later 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.420
 several passenger trains 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.659
 because of them sometimes have an order to slow down 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.410
 we are thinking of a passenger train year after year 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.770
 at least aggressively from the people to the new distance ensures 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.020
 transportation is done by the emi who this year said he signed a contract 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.710
 of concession until 2026 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.640
 but who administers this semester to cptm 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.489
 the São Paulo company responsible for transportation 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.799
 the passenger 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.039
 a rbs said the cptm requirements 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.550
 were getting more and more tight 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.100
 At the beginning of the contract, people would drive up to 18 hours on the freight train 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.780
 Somalia that included today circulate in 12 hours of spaces for transportation 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.229
 for freight trains 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.020
 also decreasing year by year 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.800
 this is the function of the increase in the number of passenger trains in circulation 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.629
 passenger transport is a priority for freight transport. 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.559
 gilmar loads and passengers in the same system still causes another bottleneck 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.949
 the capacity of a freight train could be greater said the containers that it 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:56.869
 were forwarded 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:02.129
 two containers per bum rather than one I noticed that I like the capacity more 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.649
 also the people do not 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.059
 and there is the problem 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.249
 this electric grid that feeds passenger trains is much more 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.179
 operations at the limit of capacity 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.919
 if someone wants to bring more face will not get in the Sierra de Santos 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.599
 down the company is very slow 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.409
 and I assume with motives with more than 30 years sometimes people 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:30.429
 It is seven in the evening when we finally arrive at the port of saints for 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.379
 solution would be the construction of an exclusive load line which is 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:40.349
 far from leaving the paper we managed to get on the site of 20 wagons of 29 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.299
 hours 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.879
 and what we could already as a structural solution of diversity 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.729
 between 12 hours 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.109
 of the lot of 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.439
 much more efficient
