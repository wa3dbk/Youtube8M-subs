Todd<00:01:07.030> grow<00:01:07.930> in<00:01:08.140> his<00:01:08.290> leadership<00:01:08.590> role<00:01:09.040> even

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
Todd grow in his leadership role even

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.690 
Todd grow in his leadership role even
more

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.100 

certainly<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.850> has<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.210> be<00:01:19.330> demonstrated<00:01:19.990> in

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
certainly it has to be demonstrated in

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.750 
certainly it has to be demonstrated in
practice<00:01:20.620> that<00:01:20.800> that's<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.159> best<00:01:21.370> thing<00:01:21.520> for

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
practice that that's the best thing for

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.440 
practice that that's the best thing for
the<00:01:21.820> team<00:01:22.060> but<00:01:23.310> absolutely<00:01:24.310> especially<00:01:24.940> in

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
the team but absolutely especially in

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.000 
the team but absolutely especially in
the<00:01:25.540> early<00:01:25.570> season<00:01:26.020> we've<00:01:26.350> always<00:01:26.560> tried<00:01:26.890> to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
the early season we've always tried to

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.920 
the early season we've always tried to
use<00:01:27.250> multiple<00:01:27.700> quarterbacks<00:01:28.150> just<00:01:28.600> because

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
use multiple quarterbacks just because

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.960 
use multiple quarterbacks just because
the<00:01:29.710> course<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.190> season<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.520> never<00:01:30.790> know

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
the course of the season you never know

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.520 
the course of the season you never know
how<00:01:31.119> health<00:01:31.390> is<00:01:31.570> going<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:32.260> forth

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
how health is going to go and so forth

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.950 
how health is going to go and so forth
but<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.950> think<00:01:33.400> anytime<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.820> can<00:01:34.060> maximize<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
but I think anytime you can maximize the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.550 
but I think anytime you can maximize the
talent<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.100> have<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:37.570> not<00:01:37.720> unlike<00:01:38.110> do

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
talent that you have it's not unlike do

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.440 
talent that you have it's not unlike do
you<00:01:38.650> use<00:01:38.950> some<00:01:39.610> other<00:01:39.670> receivers<00:01:40.300> at

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
you use some other receivers at

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.109 
you use some other receivers at
different<00:01:40.780> times<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:41.470> forth<00:01:42.119> absolutely

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
different times and so forth absolutely

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.860 
different times and so forth absolutely
it<00:01:43.210> can<00:01:43.240> happen

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.870 

you<00:01:51.470> know<00:01:51.620> that's<00:01:51.830> one<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.280> tough<00:01:52.550> things

there's someone in the playoff games

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.200 
there's someone in the playoff games
and<00:03:09.660> done<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.140> many<00:03:10.290> different<00:03:10.650> things<00:03:11.210> that

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
and done so many different things that

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.910 
and done so many different things that
it's<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.690> matter<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.290> don't<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.770> we

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
it's just a matter of I don't know if we

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640 
it's just a matter of I don't know if we
do<00:03:14.100> anything<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.760> he<00:03:14.880> has<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.180> done<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:16.590> now

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
do anything that he has it done but now

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
do anything that he has it done but now
he<00:03:16.850> will<00:03:17.850> need<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.210> learn<00:03:18.330> what<00:03:18.540> do<00:03:18.630> we<00:03:18.750> call<00:03:18.960> it

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
he will need to learn what do we call it

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.110 
he will need to learn what do we call it
because<00:03:19.830> we<00:03:20.070> probably<00:03:20.340> call<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.940> something

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
because we probably call it something

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.860 
because we probably call it something
different<00:03:22.430> but<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.180> don't<00:03:24.420> think<00:03:24.690> there's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
different but so I don't think there's

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.150 
different but so I don't think there's
going<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.490> an<00:03:27.140> unusual<00:03:28.140> strain<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.800> him<00:03:29.010> for

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
going to be an unusual strain on him for

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.610 
going to be an unusual strain on him for
that<00:03:29.340> fact<00:03:30.150> he<00:03:30.330> may<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.630> little<00:03:30.840> advantage

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.930 

you<00:03:39.620> know<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:39.740> think<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.490> will<00:03:40.760> be<00:03:40.790> a

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
you know I think that will be a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.230 
you know I think that will be a
challenge<00:03:41.290> because<00:03:42.290> Terrell<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:43.940> one

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
challenge because Terrell really is one

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.760 
challenge because Terrell really is one
of<00:03:44.300> those<00:03:44.390> guys<00:03:44.570> that<00:03:44.630> wants<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.620> do

everything just right to the team and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.870 
everything just right to the team and
he's<00:03:48.470> one<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.740> those<00:03:48.830> guys<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.070> he<00:03:49.490> wants<00:03:49.760> to

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
he's one of those guys that he wants to

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.350 
he's one of those guys that he wants to
please<00:03:50.290> everybody<00:03:51.290> wants<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.250> make<00:03:52.940> sure<00:03:53.180> that

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
please everybody wants to make sure that

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.449 
please everybody wants to make sure that
he's<00:03:53.450> answering<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.930> question<00:03:54.320> right<00:03:54.560> or<00:03:54.860> or

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
he's answering the question right or or

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.310 
he's answering the question right or or
you<00:03:55.880> know<00:03:56.240> throwing<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.810> ball<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:56.990> right

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
you know throwing the ball the right

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.170 
you know throwing the ball the right
place<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.980> and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
place and and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.500 
place and and
so<00:03:59.989> I<00:04:00.019> think<00:04:00.640> until<00:04:01.640> you're<00:04:01.849> comfortable<00:04:02.090> with

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
so I think until you're comfortable with

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.119 
so I think until you're comfortable with
it<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.870> know<00:04:02.900> sometimes<00:04:03.409> i'm<00:04:03.590> on<00:04:03.709> throwing<00:04:03.980> in

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
it you know sometimes i'm on throwing in

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.250 
it you know sometimes i'm on throwing in
completion<00:04:04.609> or<00:04:04.840> sometimes<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.959> know<00:04:06.079> what

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
completion or sometimes you know what

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.059 
completion or sometimes you know what
I'm<00:04:06.409> going<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> say<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:07.159> don't<00:04:07.939> know<00:04:08.980> once<00:04:09.980> he

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
I'm going to say I don't know once he

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.410 
I'm going to say I don't know once he
gets<00:04:10.250> comfortable<00:04:10.430> with<00:04:10.849> that<00:04:11.000> which<00:04:11.299> would

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
gets comfortable with that which would

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.009 
gets comfortable with that which would
be<00:04:11.510> fast<00:04:11.750> because<00:04:12.560> he's<00:04:13.370> gonna<00:04:13.579> not<00:04:13.790> know<00:04:14.019> you

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
be fast because he's gonna not know you

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.469 
be fast because he's gonna not know you
know<00:04:15.140> quite<00:04:15.469> a<00:04:15.530> bit<00:04:15.620> but<00:04:16.009> but<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.030> don't<00:04:17.329> think

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
know quite a bit but but I don't think

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.860 
know quite a bit but but I don't think
you<00:04:17.660> can<00:04:17.870> disregard<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.160> fact<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.810> know

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
you can disregard the fact that you know

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.800 
you can disregard the fact that you know
all<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.680> attention<00:04:22.100> he's<00:04:22.280> gotten<00:04:22.699> he<00:04:23.539> wants

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
all the attention he's gotten he wants

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.560 
all the attention he's gotten he wants
you<00:04:24.139> know<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.650> come<00:04:24.830> through<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.449> that's<00:04:26.449> the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
you know to come through and that's the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:35.869 
you know to come through and that's the
