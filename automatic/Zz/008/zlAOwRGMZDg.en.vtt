00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
taking it one game at a time and not

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:15.160 
taking it one game at a time and not
really<00:01:00.610> looking<00:01:00.790> past<00:01:01.090> that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.550 

the<00:01:15.890> semis<00:01:16.280> in<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.330> finals<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.900> big<00:01:18.080> step<00:01:18.320> it

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
the semis in the finals is a big step it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.110 
the semis in the finals is a big step it
was<00:01:18.620> just<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:18.890> next<00:01:19.040> step<00:01:19.340> we<00:01:19.640> got<00:01:19.790> one<00:01:19.970> more

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
was just the next step we got one more

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.730 
was just the next step we got one more
to<00:01:20.210> go<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:20.659> guys<00:01:20.810> know<00:01:21.020> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
to go and you guys know that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:41.940 
to go and you guys know that
Oh

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.630 

I<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.960> have<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.470> good<00:01:44.950> chance<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.460> just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
I think we have a good chance you just

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.359 
I think we have a good chance you just
have<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.850> keep<00:01:46.000> working<00:01:46.240> hard<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.750> yes<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.770> have

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
have to keep working hard and yes I have

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:48.749 
have to keep working hard and yes I have
to<00:01:48.400> come<00:01:48.610> out

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
to come out

00:01:48.759 --> 00:02:05.480 
to come out
be<00:01:48.909> aggressive<00:01:49.170> play<00:01:50.170> our<00:01:50.740> games

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.150 

I<00:02:08.270> think<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.569> Blucher<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.050> helps<00:02:10.289> us<00:02:10.410> with

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I think the Blucher really helps us with

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.970 
I think the Blucher really helps us with
energy<00:02:12.000> sometimes<00:02:12.440> because<00:02:13.440> sometimes<00:02:13.560> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
energy sometimes because sometimes you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.580 
energy sometimes because sometimes you
kind<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.490> get<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> lull<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.480> know<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.780> it's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
kind of get in a lull you know and it's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.170 
kind of get in a lull you know and it's
really<00:02:16.770> good<00:02:16.890> definitely<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.400> they're<00:02:17.730> back

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
really good definitely know they're back

it's<00:02:37.150> not<00:02:37.329> really<00:02:37.569> about<00:02:37.629> where<00:02:38.200> we're<00:02:38.319> at

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's not really about where we're at
right<00:02:38.439> now<00:02:38.769> but<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.159> about<00:02:39.310> how<00:02:39.430> much<00:02:39.519> better

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
right now but it's about how much better
we<00:02:39.909> can<00:02:40.000> get

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
