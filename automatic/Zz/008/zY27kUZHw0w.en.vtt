these<00:03:14.639> as<00:03:15.109> checkpoint<00:03:16.109> makers<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:17.370> ten

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
these as checkpoint makers I have ten

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.120 
these as checkpoint makers I have ten
everyone<00:03:18.180> i<00:03:18.359> have<00:03:18.600> 10<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.590> since<00:03:19.829> that's<00:03:19.980> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
checkpoint I kind of want to use it as a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.449 
checkpoint I kind of want to use it as a
checkpoint<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:24.389> can<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.630> gonna<00:03:28.459> all

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
checkpoint so can we is it gonna all

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.860 
checkpoint so can we is it gonna all
right<00:03:29.519> let's<00:03:29.760> go<00:03:29.910> let's<00:03:30.389> see<00:03:30.600> if<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.750> will

work yeah and then just go like that see

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:48.740 
work yeah and then just go like that see
checkpoint<00:03:38.370> maker<00:03:41.720> no<00:03:42.720> wrong<00:03:43.170> way<00:03:44.959> hmm<00:03:47.540> see<00:03:48.540> I

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
checkpoint maker no wrong way hmm see I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.449 
checkpoint maker no wrong way hmm see I
just<00:03:49.049> made<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.500> checkpoint<00:03:49.920> alright<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.340> this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
just made the checkpoint alright so this

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.220 
just made the checkpoint alright so this
is<00:03:50.579> where<00:03:50.730> I'm<00:03:50.819> at<00:03:51.000> I'm<00:03:51.630> gonna<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.049> make

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
is where I'm at I'm gonna have to make

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.170 
is where I'm at I'm gonna have to make
up<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.650> other<00:03:52.769> check<00:03:53.040> point<00:03:53.310> though<00:03:53.489> if

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
up the other check point though if

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.120 
up the other check point though if
there's<00:03:54.420> more<00:03:54.720> which<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.139> suspect<00:03:55.500> all<00:03:55.889> these

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
there's more which I suspect all these

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.849 
there's more which I suspect all these
are<00:03:56.310> checkpoints<00:03:56.489> wait<00:03:56.970> maybe<00:03:57.299> not<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.859> don't

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
are checkpoints wait maybe not I don't

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.190 
are checkpoints wait maybe not I don't
know<00:03:59.130> but<00:03:59.220> I<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.090> made<00:04:00.359> that<00:04:00.389> checkpoint<00:04:00.810> a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
know but I just made that checkpoint a

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.360 
know but I just made that checkpoint a
little<00:04:01.530> bit<00:04:01.650> easier<00:04:01.739> still<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.250> do<00:04:02.340> some

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
little bit easier still have to do some

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.640 
little bit easier still have to do some
parkour<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.940> get<00:04:03.120> there<00:04:03.359> but<00:04:03.569> at<00:04:04.349> least<00:04:04.470> I

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
parkour to get there but at least I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.099 
parkour to get there but at least I
jumped<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.310> Tom<00:04:05.579> didn't<00:04:05.880> even<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.150> cross

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
jumped that Tom didn't even like cross

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.020 
jumped that Tom didn't even like cross
my<00:04:07.319> mind<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.620> jump<00:04:07.889> alright<00:04:08.790> another

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
my mind to jump alright another

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.050 
my mind to jump alright another
checkpoint<00:04:09.329> okay<00:04:10.280> another<00:04:11.280> 1i<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.819> may

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
checkpoint okay another 1i that I may

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.800 
checkpoint okay another 1i that I may
have<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.329> make<00:04:12.480> up<00:04:13.190> unless<00:04:14.190> unless<00:04:14.569> this<00:04:15.569> game

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
have to make up unless unless this game

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.060 
have to make up unless unless this game
wants<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.200> let<00:04:16.410> me<00:04:16.500> win<00:04:16.680> right<00:04:17.209> nope<00:04:18.209> all<00:04:18.750> right
