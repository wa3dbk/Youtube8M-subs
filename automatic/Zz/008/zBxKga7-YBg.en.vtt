of<00:00:58.690> anodized<00:00:59.500> aluminum<00:01:00.070> alloys<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.699> it<00:01:00.760> is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
of anodized aluminum alloys so it is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.139 
of anodized aluminum alloys so it is
very<00:01:01.149> sturdy<00:01:01.570> it's<00:01:02.500> also<00:01:02.739> really<00:01:03.609> great<00:01:03.820> at<00:01:04.119> a

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149

trackpad is made out of edged glass and
it's<00:01:07.990> really<00:01:08.440> responsive<00:01:09.430> it's<00:01:09.670> got<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.880> great

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
it's really responsive it's got a great

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's really responsive it's got a great
keyboard<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:11.099> while<00:01:12.099> other<00:01:12.340> Chromebooks<00:01:12.880> had

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
keyboard and while other Chromebooks had

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.719 
keyboard and while other Chromebooks had
really<00:01:13.599> weak<00:01:13.810> speakers<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:15.039> speakers<00:01:15.520> on<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
really weak speakers the speakers on the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.639 
really weak speakers the speakers on the
pixel<00:01:16.209> which<00:01:16.330> are<00:01:16.479> hidden<00:01:16.720> underneath<00:01:17.229> the

pixel which are hidden underneath the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.710 
pixel which are hidden underneath the
keyboard<00:01:17.830> are<00:01:18.190> really<00:01:18.729> loud<00:01:18.940> when<00:01:19.300> I<00:01:19.360> started

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
keyboard are really loud when I started

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.510 
keyboard are really loud when I started
using<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:20.110> I<00:01:20.200> thought<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.530> might<00:01:20.679> have<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.190> once

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
using it I thought I might have to once

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.040 
using it I thought I might have to once
again<00:01:21.640> pull<00:01:21.970> out<00:01:22.090> my<00:01:22.209> headphones<00:01:22.660> because<00:01:22.929> I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
again pull out my headphones because I

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.480 
again pull out my headphones because I
would<00:01:23.170> be<00:01:23.229> underwhelmed<00:01:23.800> by<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.979> speaker

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
would be underwhelmed by the speaker

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.070 
would be underwhelmed by the speaker
volume<00:01:24.610> but<00:01:25.330> I<00:01:25.360> actually<00:01:25.450> had<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.780> turn<00:01:25.959> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
volume but I actually had to turn the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.690 
volume but I actually had to turn the
volume<00:01:26.319> down<00:01:26.440> because<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:27.069> was<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.429> powerful

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
volume down because it was so powerful

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.130 
volume down because it was so powerful
when<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.420> comes<00:01:28.539> to<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.750> inside<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
when it comes to the inside of the

when it comes to the inside of the
computer<00:01:29.259> google<00:01:30.069> didn't<00:01:30.369> mess<00:01:30.490> around<00:01:30.520> there

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
computer google didn't mess around there

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.510 
computer google didn't mess around there
either<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.840> pixel<00:01:32.289> uses<00:01:32.619> an<00:01:32.740> Intel<00:01:33.160> Core<00:01:33.190> i5

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
either the pixel uses an Intel Core i5

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.419 
either the pixel uses an Intel Core i5

battery<00:02:58.620> life<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.340> was<00:03:00.000> able<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.270> get<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.660> little

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
battery life I was able to get a little

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.290 
battery life I was able to get a little
over<00:03:01.320> four<00:03:01.650> hours<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:02.910> i<00:03:03.060> had<00:03:03.270> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
over four hours and if i had the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.990 
over four hours and if i had the
brightness<00:03:03.960> higher<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.560> about<00:03:04.740> 75%<00:03:05.220> i<00:03:05.700> only

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
brightness higher to about 75% i only

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.970 
brightness higher to about 75% i only
got<00:03:06.120> about<00:03:06.240> three<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.780> half<00:03:06.810> hours<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.920> it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
got about three and a half hours so it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.590 
got about three and a half hours so it
could<00:03:08.100> certainly<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.580> better<00:03:08.790> all<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.330> all<00:03:09.450> i

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
could certainly be better all in all i

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.090 
could certainly be better all in all i
really<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.200> Chromebook<00:03:10.530> pixel<00:03:10.560> as<00:03:10.950> a
