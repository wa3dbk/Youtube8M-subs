00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
our fifth keeper which was a on like a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
our fifth keeper which was a on like a
two<00:01:14.579> pound<00:01:14.759> largemouth<00:01:14.999> but<00:01:15.920> unfortunately

two pound largemouth but unfortunately

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
two pound largemouth but unfortunately
the<00:01:17.490> fish<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.450> sickly<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.259> had<00:01:19.469> a<00:01:19.499> sore

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the fish was really sickly it had a sore

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.260 
the fish was really sickly it had a sore
on<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.219> so<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.549> didn't<00:01:20.759> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.969> put<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.210> in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
on it so we didn't want to put it in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.730 
on it so we didn't want to put it in
there<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.450> contaminate<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.109> other<00:01:22.229> fish<00:01:22.469> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there and contaminate the other fish so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
there and contaminate the other fish so
we<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.520> let<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.789> go<00:01:23.819> it<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.450> not

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
we just let it go it was really not

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
we just let it go it was really not
doing<00:01:24.749> well<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.259> hopefully<00:01:26.249> we'll<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> few

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
