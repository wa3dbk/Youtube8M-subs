it launches on July the 1st and pretty

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
it launches on July the 1st and pretty
much<00:00:33.239> show<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.660> built<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
much show you how we built and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.950 
much show you how we built and
everything<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.340> case<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.239> Razer<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
everything about the case that Razer is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
everything about the case that Razer is
sponsoring<00:00:37.469> me<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.340> quite<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
sponsoring me for is actually quite a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.209 
sponsoring me for is actually quite a
bit<00:00:38.940> smaller<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.649> that's<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
bit smaller as you can see that's the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
bit smaller as you can see that's the
side<00:00:41.460> panel<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> would<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.270> about<00:00:42.450> 25<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.140> 30

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
side panel so it would be about 25 to 30

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.940 
side panel so it would be about 25 to 30
percent<00:00:43.579> smaller<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.350> ideal<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.379> landing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
percent smaller and ideal for landing

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
percent smaller and ideal for landing
and<00:00:47.070> stuff<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.180> we've<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> few

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and stuff like that so we've got a few

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600 
and stuff like that so we've got a few
sponsors<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:49.800> we'll<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> announcing<00:00:50.309> for

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

should<00:03:47.680> say<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.160> it's<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.450> mean<00:03:50.200> just<00:03:50.530> to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
should say and it's just I mean just to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.180 
should say and it's just I mean just to
use<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.850> I<00:03:52.030> think<00:03:52.960> I'd<00:03:53.320> have<00:03:53.380> trouble<00:03:53.890> using

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
use it I think I'd have trouble using

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.490 
use it I think I'd have trouble using
probably<00:03:54.610> nine<00:03:54.790> ten<00:03:55.060> eleven<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.510> twelve<00:03:55.600> but

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
probably nine ten eleven and twelve but

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.930 
probably nine ten eleven and twelve but
I<00:03:56.530> don't<00:03:56.800> think<00:03:57.010> I've<00:03:57.160> got<00:03:57.400> twelve<00:03:57.670> spells

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
I don't think I've got twelve spells

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.640 
I don't think I've got twelve spells
anyways<00:03:58.270> I've<00:03:58.510> pretty<00:03:58.690> much<00:03:58.750> got<00:03:58.990> six<00:03:59.320> so

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
anyways I've pretty much got six so

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.830 
anyways I've pretty much got six so
that's<00:03:59.860> enough<00:04:00.100> for<00:04:00.220> me<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.670> think<00:04:01.510> it's<00:04:01.690> really

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
that's enough for me I think it's really

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.150 
that's enough for me I think it's really
unique<00:04:02.170> that<00:04:02.260> they<00:04:02.410> brought<00:04:02.650> out<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:02.920> type

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
unique that they brought out this type

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.400 
unique that they brought out this type
of<00:04:03.190> Mouse<00:04:03.400> especially<00:04:04.000> for<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:05.170> type<00:04:05.380> of

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
of Mouse especially for the type of

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.860 
of Mouse especially for the type of
gamers<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:05.970> play<00:04:06.970> League<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.209> Legends<00:04:07.660> and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
gamers that play League of Legends and

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.680 
gamers that play League of Legends and
and<00:04:08.200> dota<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.340> Han<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:09.910> World<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.270> Warcraft

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
and dota and Han and World of Warcraft

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.199 
and dota and Han and World of Warcraft
and<00:04:10.930> it's<00:04:11.740> just<00:04:11.950> great<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.340> have<00:04:12.550> a<00:04:12.850> mouse<00:04:13.180> that

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
and it's just great to have a mouse that

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.090 
and it's just great to have a mouse that
has<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.900> many<00:04:14.080> buttons<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.739> can<00:04:14.890> cast

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
has so many buttons that you can cast

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.069 
has so many buttons that you can cast
spells<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.820> do<00:04:15.910> everything<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.959> you

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
spells and just do everything that you

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.569 
spells and just do everything that you
usually<00:04:17.320> have<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.709> do<00:04:17.799> on<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:17.980> keyboard<00:04:18.340> and

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
usually have to do on the keyboard and

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.819 
usually have to do on the keyboard and
now<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.750> can<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.049> do<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.230> all<00:04:20.350> in<00:04:20.500> one<00:04:20.590> place

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
now you can just do it all in one place

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.040 
now you can just do it all in one place
and<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.130> does<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.760> suppose<00:04:22.480> it<00:04:22.630> will<00:04:22.720> take<00:04:22.960> a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
and it does it I suppose it will take a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.320 
and it does it I suppose it will take a
lot<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.290> training<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:23.850> once<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:24.970> get<00:04:25.090> used<00:04:25.270> to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
lot of training but once you get used to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.550 
lot of training but once you get used to
the<00:04:25.450> buttons<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.900> once<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.110> configure<00:04:26.410> it

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
the buttons and once you configure it

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.970 
the buttons and once you configure it
properly<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:27.130> mean<00:04:28.090> you'll<00:04:29.050> be<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.440> fast<00:04:29.740> at

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
properly I mean you'll be so fast at

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.290 
properly I mean you'll be so fast at
casting<00:04:30.370> everything<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:30.790> just<00:04:31.030> your<00:04:31.570> own<00:04:31.830> so

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
casting everything you just your own so

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.000 
casting everything you just your own so
it's<00:04:34.300> definitely<00:04:34.630> nice<00:04:34.810> design<00:04:35.200> it's<00:04:35.380> a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
it's definitely nice design it's a

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.990 
it's definitely nice design it's a
really<00:04:36.760> crazy<00:04:36.970> looking<00:04:37.390> Mouse<00:04:38.760> it's<00:04:39.760> actually

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
really crazy looking Mouse it's actually

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.550 
really crazy looking Mouse it's actually
quite<00:04:40.240> hard<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.720> explain<00:04:40.990> just<00:04:41.440> how

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
quite hard to explain just how

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.430 
quite hard to explain just how
responsive<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.370> mouse<00:04:42.610> is<00:04:43.320> pretty<00:04:44.320> much

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
responsive this mouse is pretty much

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.469 
responsive this mouse is pretty much
exactly<00:04:44.919> when<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.400> move<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:45.970> moves<00:04:46.300> on<00:04:46.450> the

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
exactly when you move it it moves on the

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.270 
exactly when you move it it moves on the
screen<00:04:46.570> there's<00:04:47.320> no<00:04:47.560> lag<00:04:47.830> there's<00:04:48.160> no

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
screen there's no lag there's no

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.580 
screen there's no lag there's no
difference<00:04:48.729> it<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.660> where<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.050> want<00:04:50.229> it<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.440> be

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
difference it is where you want it to be

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.920 
difference it is where you want it to be
and<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:51.729> believe<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.150> this<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.600> actually

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
and I believe that this is actually

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.450 
and I believe that this is actually
quite<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.169> large<00:04:53.440> improvement<00:04:53.770> over<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.310> old

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
quite a large improvement over the old

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.850 
quite a large improvement over the old
iron<00:04:54.669> back<00:04:54.940> in<00:04:55.540> terms<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:56.020> responsiveness<00:04:56.500> I'm

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
iron back in terms of responsiveness I'm

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.409 
iron back in terms of responsiveness I'm
not<00:04:57.010> sure<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.280> what<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.580> exact<00:04:57.910> figures<00:04:58.270> are

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
not sure of what the exact figures are

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.050 
not sure of what the exact figures are
but<00:04:58.900> it's<00:04:59.020> just<00:04:59.140> in<00:04:59.470> real<00:05:00.010> terms<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.550> feels<00:05:00.910> a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
but it's just in real terms it feels a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.690 
but it's just in real terms it feels a
lot<00:05:01.330> quicker<00:05:01.770> I'd<00:05:02.770> like<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.070> thank<00:05:03.220> Razer<00:05:03.490> for

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
lot quicker I'd like to thank Razer for

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.000 
lot quicker I'd like to thank Razer for
giving<00:05:03.910> us<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:04.210> peripheral<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.810> use

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
giving us this peripheral to use

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.820 
giving us this peripheral to use
obviously<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:07.090> just<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.590> incredible<00:05:08.590> mouse

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
obviously it is just a incredible mouse

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.820 
obviously it is just a incredible mouse
and<00:05:09.900> we're<00:05:10.900> building<00:05:11.260> in<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.410> Chromebook

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
and we're building in the Chromebook

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.310 
and we're building in the Chromebook
computer<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:12.310> it's<00:05:12.430> gonna<00:05:12.550> fit<00:05:12.850> very<00:05:13.210> well<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
computer so it's gonna fit very well the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.710 
computer so it's gonna fit very well the
Carbide<00:05:15.100> series<00:05:15.490> is<00:05:15.640> almost<00:05:15.910> done<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.419> we're

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
Carbide series is almost done and we're

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.260 
Carbide series is almost done and we're
doing<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.290> videos<00:05:17.590> on<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.800> now<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.270> we're

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
doing the videos on that now and we're

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.659 
doing the videos on that now and we're
starting<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.690> new<00:05:19.720> series<00:05:20.169> called<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:21.190> Black

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
starting a new series called the Black

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.969 
starting a new series called the Black
Diamond<00:05:21.940> series<00:05:22.419> which<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.140> a<00:05:23.169> smaller<00:05:23.650> case

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
Diamond series which is a smaller case

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.640 
Diamond series which is a smaller case
which<00:05:24.970> will<00:05:25.150> hit<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.450> market<00:05:25.810> July<00:05:26.140> first<00:05:26.470> as

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
which will hit the market July first as

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.400 
which will hit the market July first as
well<00:05:26.830> so<00:05:27.640> both<00:05:27.940> cases<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.630> carbide<00:05:29.020> Series

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
well so both cases the carbide Series

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.560 
well so both cases the carbide Series
and<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.680> Black<00:05:29.890> Diamond<00:05:30.100> will<00:05:30.910> be<00:05:31.060> available

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
and the Black Diamond will be available

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.500
