their MIDI controllers with the color
they<00:01:36.409> want<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:37.090> then<00:01:38.090> on<00:01:38.540> your<00:01:38.750> right<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
they want and then on your right is the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.319 
they want and then on your right is the
assembly<00:01:40.219> station<00:01:40.640> where<00:01:40.790> we<00:01:40.880> put<00:01:41.090> all<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
assembly station where we put all the

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.330 
assembly station where we put all the
MIDI<00:01:41.509> fighters<00:01:41.840> together<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.829> MIDI<00:01:43.039> fighter

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
MIDI fighters together the MIDI fighter

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.520 
MIDI fighters together the MIDI fighter
has<00:01:43.969> grown<00:01:44.240> up<00:01:44.450> now<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.020> we've<00:01:45.140> added<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
has grown up now and we've added the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.920 
has grown up now and we've added the
MIDI<00:01:45.710> fighter<00:01:45.920> 3d<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.880> line<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.479> that's

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
MIDI fighter 3d to the line and that's

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.200 
MIDI fighter 3d to the line and that's
this<00:01:48.079> guy<00:01:48.170> here<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.399> difference<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:49.939> that

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
this guy here and the difference is that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.020 
this guy here and the difference is that
this<00:01:50.689> is<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.899> lot<00:01:51.110> more<00:01:51.140> scalable<00:01:51.590> we<00:01:52.280> produce

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
this is a lot more scalable we produce

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.029 
this is a lot more scalable we produce
these<00:01:53.270> by<00:01:53.509> hand<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> office<00:01:54.469> one<00:01:54.680> by<00:01:54.829> one

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
these by hand in the office one by one

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.950 
these by hand in the office one by one
and<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.399> really<00:01:55.700> time<00:01:56.240> consuming<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.840> do

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
and it's really time consuming to do

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.450 
and it's really time consuming to do
that<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.740> want<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.979> be<00:01:58.070> able<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.310> give

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
that and we want to be able to give

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.160 
that and we want to be able to give
people<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.820> option<00:01:58.969> of<00:01:59.240> changing<00:01:59.600> out<00:01:59.960> their

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
people the option of changing out their

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.410 
people the option of changing out their
buttons<00:02:00.530> themselves<00:02:01.060> inside<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.210> software

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
buttons themselves inside the software

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.800 
buttons themselves inside the software
so<00:02:03.109> what<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:03.320> did<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.619> make<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.950> 3d<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:05.060> 3d<00:02:05.539> is

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
so what we did to make the 3d of 3d is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.050 
so what we did to make the 3d of 3d is
we<00:02:06.109> put<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.619> gyroscope<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.340> accelerometer<00:02:07.430> and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
we put a gyroscope and accelerometer and

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.580 
we put a gyroscope and accelerometer and
a<00:02:08.119> compass<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.200> we're<00:02:09.319> actually<00:02:09.410> able

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
a compass in it so we're actually able

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.490 
a compass in it so we're actually able
to<00:02:09.769> predictably<00:02:10.690> determine<00:02:11.690> exactly<00:02:12.110> where

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
to predictably determine exactly where

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.850 
to predictably determine exactly where
in<00:02:12.709> space<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.160> controller

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
in space this controller

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
in space this controller
at<00:02:14.010> any<00:02:14.130> time<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.670> all<00:02:14.820> three<00:02:15.210> dimensions<00:02:15.750> so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
at any time in all three dimensions so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.280 
at any time in all three dimensions so
let's<00:02:16.380> say<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> turn<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> button<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.360> hit

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
let's say I turn on a button and I hit

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.230 
let's say I turn on a button and I hit
button<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.650> turn<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:19.950> an<00:02:20.070> effect<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.970> then

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
button I turn on an effect I can then

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.060 
button I turn on an effect I can then
modulate<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.870> effect<00:02:22.290> by<00:02:22.440> moving<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.920> MIDI

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
modulate that effect by moving the MIDI

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.370 
modulate that effect by moving the MIDI
fighter<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.670> either<00:02:23.850> direction<00:02:24.380> let's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
fighter I'm in either direction let's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.110 
fighter I'm in either direction let's
say<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.800> reduce<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.610> amount<00:02:26.820> we

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
say I want to reduce the amount we

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
say I want to reduce the amount we
affect<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.600> might<00:02:27.780> tilt<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.200> forward<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.980> lower

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
affect I might tilt it forward and lower

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
affect I might tilt it forward and lower
that<00:02:29.610> registers<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.350> holding

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
that registers but when you're holding

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.370 
that registers but when you're holding
it<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:33.120> now<00:02:33.270> have<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> benefit<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.990> muscle

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
it you now have the benefit of muscle

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020 
it you now have the benefit of muscle
memory<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.680> gravity<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.850> actually

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
memory and gravity so you can actually

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.880 
memory and gravity so you can actually
use<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> position<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.680> full

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
use you know the position of your full

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 
use you know the position of your full
body<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.610> start<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> get<00:02:39.060> into<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.510> kind

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
body and you start to get into this kind

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.500 
body and you start to get into this kind
of<00:02:39.900> more<00:02:40.170> musical<00:02:40.830> muscle<00:02:41.790> memory<00:02:42.120> space

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
of more musical muscle memory space

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.810 
of more musical muscle memory space
where<00:02:43.050> you've<00:02:43.800> forgotten<00:02:44.310> about<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
