sure you can read about unpick X sealed
that<00:02:06.350> UK<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.880> but<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:10.789> what<00:02:10.970> they

wanted I think was just to make a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120 
wanted I think was just to make a
educational<00:02:14.240> system<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:15.770> they<00:02:15.920> came<00:02:16.069> up

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
educational system and what they came up

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.120 
educational system and what they came up
with<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.660> actually<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> system<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.740> is<00:02:18.920> I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
with this is actually a system that is I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.030 
with this is actually a system that is I
call<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.459> robot<00:02:20.030> ready<00:02:20.270> because<00:02:20.569> this<00:02:21.470> both

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
call it robot ready because this both

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.940 
call it robot ready because this both
the<00:02:22.220> chip<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.670> course<00:02:22.930> all<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.110> chips<00:02:24.319> there

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
the chip of course all the chips there

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.830 
the chip of course all the chips there
are<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.280> common<00:02:25.550> different<00:02:25.790> sizes<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.660> then

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
are the common different sizes but then

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.140 
are the common different sizes but then

with<00:02:32.300> these<00:02:32.660> tips<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.170> these<00:02:33.890> bots<00:02:34.220> are<00:02:34.370> quite

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
with these tips and these bots are quite

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.240 
with these tips and these bots are quite
handy<00:02:35.209> because<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:36.170> lot<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.770> them<00:02:36.950> come<00:02:37.190> with

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
handy because a lot of them come with

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.290 
handy because a lot of them come with
what<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:38.300> call<00:02:38.330> motor<00:02:38.720> drivers<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:40.300> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
what we call motor drivers and the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.729 
what we call motor drivers and the
ability<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:42.110> revert<00:02:42.860> current<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:45.200> will

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
ability to revert current so you will

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.470 
ability to revert current so you will
not<00:02:45.890> only<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> robot<00:02:46.849> driving<00:02:47.270> forward

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
not only have a robot driving forward

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.350 
not only have a robot driving forward
and<00:02:47.840> then<00:02:48.130> stopping<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.760> also<00:02:49.910> make<00:02:50.330> it

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
and then stopping you can also make it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:12.199 
and then stopping you can also make it
provide<00:02:50.930> backwards

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.199 

and<00:03:13.379> as<00:03:14.379> for<00:03:14.530> programming<00:03:15.040> YTM<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.849> programmed

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
and as for programming YTM is programmed

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.780 
and as for programming YTM is programmed
in<00:03:16.329> basic<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.859> personally<00:03:18.370> think<00:03:18.579> that's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
in basic and I personally think that's

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.869 
in basic and I personally think that's
the<00:03:18.939> best<00:03:19.379> programming<00:03:20.379> language<00:03:20.769> for<00:03:21.280> robust

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
the best programming language for robust

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.819 
the best programming language for robust
because<00:03:22.359> well<00:03:22.989> I've<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.349> about<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.680> say

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
because well I've just about to say

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.849 
because well I've just about to say
because<00:03:24.129> its<00:03:24.489> basic<00:03:24.930> actually<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.079> limited

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
because its basic actually the limited

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.059 
because its basic actually the limited
framework<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.819> me<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.950> support<00:03:29.950> the

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
framework to me just the support the

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.009 
framework to me just the support the
creativity<00:03:30.459> because<00:03:30.849> it's<00:03:31.299> sort<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:31.959> a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
creativity because it's sort of like a

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.599 
creativity because it's sort of like a
little<00:03:32.290> funny<00:03:32.530> computer<00:03:32.859> game<00:03:33.159> you<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.519> only

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
little funny computer game you can only

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.550 
little funny computer game you can only
do<00:03:33.819> this<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.359> then<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.540> find<00:03:34.930> funny<00:03:35.170> ways<00:03:35.409> of

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
do this and then you find funny ways of

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.009 
do this and then you find funny ways of
doing<00:03:35.889> it<00:03:35.980> otherwise<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:37.209> whole<00:03:37.450> world<00:03:37.840> is

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
doing it otherwise the whole world is

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.080 
doing it otherwise the whole world is
open<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.920> like<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> child<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.879> toy<00:03:40.030> store

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
open and you like a child in a toy store

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.119 
open and you like a child in a toy store
like<00:03:40.599> what<00:03:40.900> should<00:03:41.139> i<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.620> how<00:03:41.739> should<00:03:41.980> I

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
like what should i do and how should I

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.240 
like what should i do and how should I
do<00:03:42.189> it<00:03:43.470> apparently<00:03:44.470> some<00:03:44.739> people<00:03:44.769> think<00:03:45.129> that

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
do it apparently some people think that

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.899 
do it apparently some people think that
I'm<00:03:45.370> doing<00:03:46.030> some<00:03:46.299> past<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.700> robotic<00:03:48.700> stuff

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
I'm doing some past the robotic stuff

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.530 
I'm doing some past the robotic stuff
and<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.920> thing<00:03:51.129> is<00:03:51.159> I<00:03:51.549> wouldn't<00:03:51.939> have<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.359> clue

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
and the thing is I wouldn't have a clue

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.589 
and the thing is I wouldn't have a clue
about<00:03:52.629> how<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.079> do<00:03:53.980> any<00:03:54.489> advanced<00:03:54.970> programming

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
about how to do any advanced programming

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.750 
about how to do any advanced programming
because<00:03:55.750> i'm<00:03:56.169> not<00:03:56.290> really<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.590> programmer<00:03:57.040> this

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
because i'm not really a programmer this

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.330 
because i'm not really a programmer this
robot<00:03:58.209> child<00:03:58.449> doesn't<00:03:58.769> understand<00:03:59.769> much<00:04:00.010> so

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
robot child doesn't understand much so

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.250 
robot child doesn't understand much so
you'll<00:04:00.579> have<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.819> put<00:04:01.660> yourself<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.139> place

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you'll have to put yourself in the place

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.939 
you'll have to put yourself in the place
of<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:04.290> ball<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.680> say<00:04:05.980> ok<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:07.379> now<00:04:08.379> first

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
of the ball and you say ok and now first

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.129 
of the ball and you say ok and now first
drive<00:04:09.519> ahead<00:04:09.699> and<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:10.569> can<00:04:10.720> teach<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.019> robot

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
drive ahead and you can teach the robot

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.689 
drive ahead and you can teach the robot
to<00:04:11.409> do<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.010> then<00:04:12.849> it<00:04:13.000> into<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.049> wall<00:04:14.699> so

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
to do that and then it into the wall so

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.310 
to do that and then it into the wall so
you<00:04:15.879> put<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> sensor<00:04:16.510> on<00:04:16.659> top<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.109> perhaps

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
you put a sensor on top of it perhaps

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.129 
you put a sensor on top of it perhaps
and<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.340> say<00:04:18.519> okay<00:04:18.970> now<00:04:19.510> look<00:04:19.720> when<00:04:19.989> this

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
and you say okay now look when this

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.140 
and you say okay now look when this
sensor<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.530> getting<00:04:21.400> too<00:04:21.519> close<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.909> the<00:04:22.000> wall

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
sensor is getting too close to the wall

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.510 
sensor is getting too close to the wall
you<00:04:22.570> shoot<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.990> sort<00:04:23.349> of<00:04:23.409> stop<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.830> then<00:04:24.370> it

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
you shoot the sort of stop and then it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.760 
you shoot the sort of stop and then it
does<00:04:24.909> that<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.419> then<00:04:26.199> you<00:04:26.289> look<00:04:26.440> at<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.680> a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
does that and then you look at it's a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.290 
does that and then you look at it's a
fine<00:04:27.010> good<00:04:27.340> robot<00:04:27.699> and<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.090> progress

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
fine good robot and you just progress

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.800 
fine good robot and you just progress
like<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.729> that's<00:04:30.729> how<00:04:30.909> it<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
like that and that's how it like the the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:48.210 
like that and that's how it like the the
Euro<00:04:32.020> drum<00:04:32.289> machine<00:04:32.590> that's<00:04:32.889> just<00:04:33.070> how<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.639> did

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.040 

humans<00:04:49.220> are<00:04:49.340> humans<00:04:49.490> slice<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.210> life<00:04:50.390> robots

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
humans are humans slice of life robots

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.620 
humans are humans slice of life robots
are<00:04:51.170> robust<00:04:51.530> but<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.890> think<00:04:52.130> they<00:04:52.220> can<00:04:52.370> all<00:04:52.520> be

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
are robust but I think they can all be

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.620 
are robust but I think they can all be
sort<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.690> alive<00:04:54.230> in<00:04:54.500> their<00:04:54.680> own<00:04:55.150> way<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.510> you

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
sort of alive in their own way if you

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.850 
sort of alive in their own way if you
know<00:04:56.720> what<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.900> mean<00:04:58.240> okay<00:04:59.380> when<00:05:00.380> we<00:05:00.500> work<00:05:00.710> with

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
know what I mean okay when we work with

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.160 
know what I mean okay when we work with
robots<00:05:01.250> say<00:05:01.550> we<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.300> make<00:05:02.510> autonomous

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
robots say we like to make autonomous

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.150 
robots say we like to make autonomous
robots<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:05.060> like<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.470> solve<00:05:06.470> create<00:05:06.860> life

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
robots and we like to solve create life

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.210 
robots and we like to solve create life
you<00:05:07.580> can<00:05:07.790> argue<00:05:08.420> of<00:05:08.630> course<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.650> life<00:05:09.890> or<00:05:10.100> is

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
you can argue of course is it life or is

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.030 
you can argue of course is it life or is
it<00:05:10.340> not<00:05:11.080> but<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:14.090> may<00:05:14.270> be<00:05:14.500> maybe<00:05:15.500> we<00:05:16.010> should

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
it not but it may be maybe we should

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.090 
it not but it may be maybe we should
redefine<00:05:16.790> what<00:05:17.480> we<00:05:17.630> call<00:05:17.840> life<00:05:18.110> maybe<00:05:18.920> it's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
redefine what we call life maybe it's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.220 
redefine what we call life maybe it's
not<00:05:19.300> something<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.420> alive<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:20.720> something's

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
not something is alive and something's

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.990 
not something is alive and something's
not<00:05:21.410> maybe<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:21.950> can<00:05:22.130> make<00:05:22.280> something<00:05:22.700> that<00:05:22.880> is

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
not maybe you can make something that is

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.580 
not maybe you can make something that is
partly<00:05:23.420> alive<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.200> I<00:05:25.390> mean<00:05:26.390> sometimes<00:05:27.110> people

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
partly alive and I mean sometimes people

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.500 
partly alive and I mean sometimes people
define<00:05:28.250> life<00:05:28.610> with<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:30.620> ability<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:31.480> tell<00:05:32.480> a

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
define life with the ability to tell a

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.170 
define life with the ability to tell a
joke<00:05:32.870> or<00:05:33.200> be<00:05:33.650> creative<00:05:34.100> but<00:05:34.340> I<00:05:34.490> mean<00:05:34.640> can<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:34.910> fly

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
joke or be creative but I mean can I fly

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.090 
joke or be creative but I mean can I fly
tell<00:05:35.660> a<00:05:35.690> joke<00:05:35.930> will<00:05:36.170> be<00:05:36.260> created<00:05:36.650> no<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:36.890> can't

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
tell a joke will be created no it can't

what what we think that my friends and I

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.700 
what what we think that my friends and I
will<00:05:45.650> be<00:05:45.800> building<00:05:46.100> robot<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:47.410> you<00:05:48.410> can

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
will be building robot is that you can

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.090 
will be building robot is that you can
sort<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.610> create<00:05:49.940> something<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.419> is<00:05:51.100> partly

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
sort of create something that is partly

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.740 
sort of create something that is partly
alive<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:54.280> for<00:05:55.280> that<00:05:55.430> magic<00:05:56.419> to<00:05:56.540> happen

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
alive and and for that magic to happen

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.600 
alive and and for that magic to happen
you<00:05:57.290> just<00:05:57.320> sit<00:05:57.770> there<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.100> you<00:05:58.220> have<00:05:58.370> for<00:05:58.580> a

you just sit there and you have for a
lot<00:05:58.790> of<00:05:58.880> parts<00:05:59.240> laying<00:05:59.450> around<00:05:59.630> you<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.169> and

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
lot of parts laying around you and and

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.310 
lot of parts laying around you and and
you<00:06:01.190> glue<00:06:01.430> them<00:06:01.760> together<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.419> yes<00:06:02.750> they<00:06:03.080> said

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
you glue them together and yes they said

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.190 
you glue them together and yes they said
you<00:06:03.590> teach<00:06:03.980> the<00:06:04.190> robot<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.550> so<00:06:04.790> forth<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.240> at

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
you teach the robot and so forth and at

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.060 
you teach the robot and so forth and at
a<00:06:06.260> point<00:06:06.620> all<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.310> sudden<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.850> things<00:06:08.240> Samus

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
a point all the sudden the things Samus

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.760 
a point all the sudden the things Samus
it<00:06:10.070> is<00:06:10.790> alive<00:06:11.180> it<00:06:11.240> is<00:06:11.560> actually<00:06:12.560> doing

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
it is alive it is actually doing

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.430 
it is alive it is actually doing
something<00:06:13.130> that<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:13.760> did<00:06:14.270> not<00:06:14.300> tell<00:06:15.020> it<00:06:15.200> to

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
something that you did not tell it to

something that you did not tell it to
you<00:06:15.740> just<00:06:16.190> said<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:16.460> it<00:06:16.760> if<00:06:16.970> you're<00:06:17.360> in<00:06:17.450> this

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
you just said to it if you're in this

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.750 
you just said to it if you're in this
situation<00:06:17.840> measuring<00:06:18.800> that<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:19.340> were<00:06:19.520> in

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
in that situation you should sort of

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.560 
in that situation you should sort of
move<00:06:24.110> this<00:06:24.290> that<00:06:24.530> way<00:06:24.740> it's<00:06:25.250> interacting<00:06:25.880> with

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
move this that way it's interacting with

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.260 
move this that way it's interacting with
the<00:06:26.660> surroundings<00:06:27.140> and<00:06:27.490> all<00:06:28.490> of<00:06:28.700> a<00:06:28.760> sudden<00:06:28.820> you

there but to me they were way too
focused<00:07:14.199> on<00:07:14.289> electronics<00:07:14.949> or<00:07:15.190> coding<00:07:16.090> or

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
focused on electronics or coding or

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.350 
focused on electronics or coding or
techniques<00:07:17.650> all<00:07:17.919> that<00:07:18.159> stuff<00:07:18.460> and<00:07:18.669> not<00:07:19.240> so

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 
techniques all that stuff and not so

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.760 
techniques all that stuff and not so
much<00:07:19.389> at<00:07:19.690> the<00:07:19.780> community<00:07:20.409> and<00:07:20.710> the

think<00:07:24.840> the<00:07:25.840> chips<00:07:26.080> you<00:07:26.199> can<00:07:26.229> buy<00:07:26.500> now<00:07:26.530> they<00:07:27.400> are

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
think the chips you can buy now they are

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.520 
think the chips you can buy now they are
actually<00:07:27.909> it's<00:07:28.449> actually<00:07:28.720> so<00:07:28.990> easy<00:07:29.169> to<00:07:29.380> buy

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
actually it's actually so easy to buy

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.189 
actually it's actually so easy to buy
robots<00:07:29.979> so<00:07:30.250> you<00:07:30.310> just<00:07:30.610> need<00:07:30.729> immunity<00:07:31.539> that

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
robots so you just need immunity that

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.399 
robots so you just need immunity that
the<00:07:32.800> is<00:07:33.400> able<00:07:34.120> to<00:07:34.240> catch<00:07:34.690> you<00:07:34.720> and<00:07:34.870> start<00:07:35.380> you

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289 
to build robots yourself or even just

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:42.899 
to build robots yourself or even just
checking<00:07:41.830> out<00:07:41.949> the<00:07:41.979> robots<00:07:42.460> that<00:07:42.610> others<00:07:42.880> are

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:42.909
