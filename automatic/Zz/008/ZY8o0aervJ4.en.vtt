 paper foldings more effectively 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.869
 were books that bring some 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.900
 knowledge that today we 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.970

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.150

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.010
 in the various canals that 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.650

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 I learned a lot in those little books 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.620

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.820
 with hard cover but there is a model 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.820
 smaller and cheaper 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.660
 there were some things like that here 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.690
