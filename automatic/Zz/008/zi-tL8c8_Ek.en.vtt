and it's exciting enough that you want
to<00:01:21.189> kind<00:01:21.400> of<00:01:21.490> continue<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:22.060> gee<00:01:22.240> what's

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
to kind of continue that gee what's

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.420 
to kind of continue that gee what's
coming<00:01:22.930> up<00:01:23.020> next<00:01:23.080> kind<00:01:23.470> of<00:01:23.590> a<00:01:23.650> thing<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.250> is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
coming up next kind of a thing this is

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.860 
coming up next kind of a thing this is
something<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.120> haven't<00:01:25.300> seen<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> lot<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
something that we haven't seen a lot of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.740 
something that we haven't seen a lot of
and<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.409> think<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.730> could<00:01:27.760> be<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
and I think that it could be the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.310 
and I think that it could be the
beginning<00:01:28.900> of<00:01:29.610> an<00:01:30.610> exciting<00:01:31.150> new<00:01:31.690> error<00:01:31.960> in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
beginning of an exciting new error in

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.490 
beginning of an exciting new error in
the<00:01:32.500> way<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.830> comics<00:01:33.280> are<00:01:34.240> brought<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.409> the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
the way the comics are brought to the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.850 
the way the comics are brought to the
public<00:01:35.860> sparks<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.700> trying<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.450> do<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:38.620> good

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
public sparks is trying to do the good

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
public sparks is trying to do the good
thing<00:01:39.330> but<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.570> have<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.020> get<00:01:41.550> kind<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
thing but you have to get kind of a

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.270 
thing but you have to get kind of a
illegal<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:44.080> do<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.380> right<00:01:44.530> things<00:01:44.800> sometimes

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
illegal to do the right things sometimes

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.450 
illegal to do the right things sometimes
it<00:01:45.909> goes<00:01:46.180> beyond<00:01:46.690> revenge<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.950> goes<00:01:48.159> to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
it goes beyond revenge it goes to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.149
