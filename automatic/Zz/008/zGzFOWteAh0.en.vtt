00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.270

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:06.319
 I do not know I left the pot is the cinema mode 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.129
 and 1 kilo good stop between a game 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.950
 as he just saw there he does not train 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.389
 there were two minutes left one 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.470
 a nuclear triple because I stayed with 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:20.060
 29 streak I stayed with gusts 20 and 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.659
 well then there is a referral of with 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.659
 streak 20 not 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.959
 well there are some good mortal remains 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.140
 here as m2 omission in this game there are 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.540
 he does not respect them is that if you know if he goes is 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.290
 a group of to continue playing in this 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.290
 new game is that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.360
 especially if everyone goes to his because 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.430
 good eyes not that you're in games 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.700
 public and colleagues begin to 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.700
 throw 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.790
 they begin to stretch dogs swarming and 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.340
 you stretching the bone so that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.670
 this candidate that's what fuck a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 little but good is what there is not and good 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.430

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.470
 good of all the ones that lack of the channel 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.440
 I hope 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.390
 much that involved more with more casualties not 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.390
 I'm going that because I have double 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.060
 I have many double fashions and well this 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.389
 I will go up to the channel since they have 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.389
 thought of two weeks ago and good 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.720
 what topics I wanted to comment and good 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.830
 here I get a expose of flipas 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.340
 because for me in front of my face I 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.590
 I put here and they showed up on my face 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.860
 and good is a game with 150 casualties for 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.650
 there 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.389
 at 150 casualties I think they are and good with 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.879
 22,000 points 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.759
 good do not lose flags of a game 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.580
 that if not very big with the 30,000 if 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:11.490
 you take the flag and 600 casualties are 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:15.110
 the 30 points and the cinemas and good 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.520
 and I do not know very well comment worth not 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:22.250
 I'm not a great comment it's worth 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.480
 commenting I'm not a good voice or something 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.270

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:34.670
 biche the senses are the derbies and 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:45.280
 well it's going to end up in minutes out there 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:45.280
 to speak to God and subscribe a greeting 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.289
 if you go 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.110
 I do not like it 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.130
