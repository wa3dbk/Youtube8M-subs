00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.979
 good 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.840
 Well, not 8 is a product that comes 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.119
 to complement our range last night 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:18.180
 you know we had no cars with 5.5 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:21.480
 inch know 10.1 is a tablet of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.290
 10 inches we incorporated a car 8 that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.120
 is an 8-inch tablet you know that 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.190
 the category is not distinguished by the 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.500
 use of what is the pencil 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.989
 digital spain vale is the big difference 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 with respect to another product in the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 market that facilitates the pencil 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.399
 basically interaction improves the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.470
 way or combines the way 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.110
 use with traditional finger in 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.520
 touch screens with this pencil 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 digital 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.140
 that comes to complement complements and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.200
 enriches the family 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 and basically it's an invitation to the 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.010
 improvement in productivity for the world 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.070
 professional but also the improvement in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.330
 mobility in the residential world with what 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.370
 what we hope is that you have very 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.880
 good reception in the market with respect 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.130
 the market the penetration rate of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.830
 smartphone is becoming higher then 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.910
 right now there is possibility and the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.300
 technology allows it to go down in 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.100
 price tickets but the proposal of 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.290
 samsung is to have a proposal both in 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.500
 the premium part of the market as the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.730
 part of market entry said this 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.080
 we have a portfolio where 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.840
 You can find a value proposition 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.460
 in each of the price segments and 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.680
 what we expect depending on the market 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.840
 because we have to have perspective 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.619
 global is what is the behavior of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.970
 market and what is their purchasing power 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.820
 what agents are in that market if it is 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.890
 a market where the operator is the one 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.970
 dynamizes if it is a market where is the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.130
 free market which works 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.230
 with which I think there are no 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.490
 unique solutions I mean that every 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.520
 one of the markets is going to have a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 certain behavior with respect 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.759
 to this I believe that that vision is in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.690
 a position 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.820
 pretty good to be able to compete 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.410
 the second of the question he asked me 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.050
 operating systems 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.310
 osasuna right now from the perspective 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.850
 of operating systems we are 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.520
 agnostics is worth while it is true that 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.930
 Android is the operating system that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.970
 right now he has more traction in the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.970
 market but we are also 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.040
 supporting the windows 8 platform and 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.280
 our relationship with microsoft is very 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.770
 good and we are also supporting other 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.440
 initiative that is tyson 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.240
 where are we collaborating with intel in 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.950
 able to approach it to a third platform 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.740
 open in the market then 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.500
 well let's see how we can handle 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.200
 all this more than ever 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.239
 it's hardware by itself 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.680
 has no value more than ever, not then 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.730
 on samsung 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.349
 we are trying to enrich with the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.080
 different platforms and systems 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.380
 operational what is that hardware more 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.950
 that software are a single body said 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.599
 this not only to be able to all the emphasis on 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.290
 that the devices are becoming more 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.780
 smart and in that intelligence is the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.180
 way in which the user interacts 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.640
 with the device and the device 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.060
 interacts with the user and up there 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.060
 I can read
