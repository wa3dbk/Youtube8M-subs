00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 cases when European cars 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.220
 manufacturers leave two generations 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 same model in production 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.679
 extremely rare but the Chinese huver who 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 only included in bulk export 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.929
 the market including went to Russia 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.780
 that is why be hover h3 hover h5 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.850
 today in antiquity gearbox 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.400
 the latest generation of haber debuted 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.770
 in February of this year 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.370
 and then came but 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.970
 new engine volume is 2 and 4 liters 136 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.970
 horsepower power 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
 the new generation has become more powerful engine 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.130
 already on 14 to was at low revs clearly 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 not enough power to keep 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.970
 a little bit higher on the boxes of the article 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.780
 nothing switches clearly enough 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.320
 fairly quiet rides true yes 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.210
 quietly enough allowed houses almost no 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.830
 acoustic comfort at least 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.880
 four hotels are not managed 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.170
 normal slightly looser 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.610
 compared there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.080
 honed in general by a solid 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.980
 you stand feeling 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.220
 like, let's give again 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.210
 this cooler with nabey on 4 listeners 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.430
 Today 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.380
 subjectively it is generally invisible between 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.880
 other smoothness is the same everywhere 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.460
 almost identical cars 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.680
 the main and most noticeable difference between the two 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 of these generations lies in their outer 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.340
 design 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.490
 the updated hoover has more powerful 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.460
 diesel more powerful gasoline engine 2 and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.619
 4 instead of 2 and 0 but this one remains in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.899
 selling in my opinion and exclusively 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.090
 because of the more impressive fundamental 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.369
 appearance and becoming the body they almost 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.040
 same but differently solved back 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.229
 parts of the front here's an updated huver he 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.429
 somewhat so by intellectuals if possible 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.410
 so put it even a little bit 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.190
 cunning floor is nothing but oh by 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.289
 sophisticated 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.800
 this design is such more chopped 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.320
 multifaceted 1 this is a thicker hood line and 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.869
 fundamental nose i like feeling 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.910
 security there is yes of course 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.429
 road circles I will remind the car 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.489
 frame full SUV because 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.950
 rear spring clearance of 24 centimeters 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.980
 easy asphalt transmission 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.920
 works in three modes 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.230
 rear -wheel drive four-wheel drive is normal 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.370
 transmission and four-wheel drive on the bottom 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.370
 the transmission is confident that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.560
 in both cars is enough 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.290
 modern interior 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.170
 hard in many ways well assembled well 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.299
 all plastic models by the way many 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.000
 great ox nodes in particular motors and 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.819
 boxes are made under Japanese licenses 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.060
 it adds durability to them 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.939
 perhaps operational difference new 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.250
 hawera is that there is 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.019
 version with automatic box true 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.920
 so far only steamed with turbo diesel 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.780
 motor is fantastic in definition and 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.819
 the color of the image on the camera behind 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.400
 yes cons on bottoms lacking dynamics 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.640
 Salon plastic is bluff plus 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.260
 interesting enough which is quite important 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.040
 independent design good off-road 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.560
 opportunities 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.620
 but with regard to the ride comfort 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.630
 I think everything is in order of price 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.330
 haber and start at seven hundred 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.489
 ten thousand rubles up to that price 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.489
 frame SUV hard to find
