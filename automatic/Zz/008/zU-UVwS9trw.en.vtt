00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.849 
Motorola Atrix and it looks very similar
with<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.429> same<00:01:06.729> launcher<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.210> whatnot<00:01:07.859> the

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
with the same launcher and whatnot the

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:10.319 
with the same launcher and whatnot the
tablet<00:01:09.219> itself<00:01:09.490> has<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.729> resistive

tablet itself has a resistive

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.749 
tablet itself has a resistive

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
touchscreen so it's not capacitive like

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.840 
touchscreen so it's not capacitive like
a<00:01:13.060> phone<00:01:13.450> or<00:01:13.869> an<00:01:13.960> iPad<00:01:14.380> or<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.770> four<00:01:15.639> or<00:01:15.700> five

expect<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.850> be<00:01:21.999> perfect<00:01:22.479> for<00:01:22.719> 75<00:01:23.289> dollars

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
expect it to be perfect for 75 dollars

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
flash custom firmware to it like i said

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.160 
flash custom firmware to it like i said
it<00:03:51.730> was<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.850> little<00:03:52.030> bit<00:03:52.239> difficult<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:53.019> it

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
it was a little bit difficult to get it
