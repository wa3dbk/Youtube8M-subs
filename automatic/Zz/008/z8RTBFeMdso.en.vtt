Ice Cream Sandwich elite because you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
Ice Cream Sandwich elite because you
felt<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.250> would<00:00:26.369> take<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> off

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the upgrade path through verizon so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.250 
the upgrade path through verizon so
that's<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.510> case<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:31.019> know<00:00:31.080> that's

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's just not the case I know that's

are on the leak we go to settings and

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.450 
are on the leak we go to settings and
about<00:00:56.969> phone<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:59.870> my<00:01:00.870> build<00:01:01.079> number<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.590> 6<00:01:02.100> 7

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
about phone and my build number is 6 7

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.570 
about phone and my build number is 6 7
223<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.710> Android<00:01:04.979> version<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.400> for

223 one and the Android version is for

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
223 one and the Android version is for
diode<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.510> also<00:01:06.659> work<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
diode up for this will also work for the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.000 
diode up for this will also work for the
newer<00:01:07.830> version<00:01:08.310> 6<00:01:08.670> 7<00:01:09.030> 2<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> 3<00:01:10.409> 2<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> 2<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> 3<00:01:12.240> 3

so<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.130> should<00:01:14.549> work<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.880> any<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.240> those<00:01:15.420> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so that should work with any of those so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
so that should work with any of those so
all<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.920> we're<00:01:17.310> going

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
all you have to do here is we're going

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.780 
all you have to do here is we're going
to<00:01:17.460> power<00:01:17.670> down<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> phone<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.670> will<00:01:23.670> boot

into fastboot the way that you boot into

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
into fastboot the way that you boot into
fastboot<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> hold<00:01:30.060> both

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
fastboot you're going to hold both

scroll down to AP fastboot and hit the
up<00:01:38.390> volume<00:01:39.390> key<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.810> we're<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.049> fastboot
