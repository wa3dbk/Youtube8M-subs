00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:11.567
 Experienced pilots know that flying is learning how to drop yourself from the sky to the ground and can’t fall. 

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:17.100
 We are Luke and Billy, welcome to the new season's "Join Stunt Squadron"! 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
 During the break, some major changes have taken place in the show. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.767
 The first is the task 

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:38.533
 Now, it’s not enough to be the first player to send us the full route. You have to be the fastest player to fly the whole route. 

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.867
 By the way, this is the new route. 

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:48.733
 So, drive your Bf 109B and fly to the Lighthouse area. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.333
 Everyone should complete this route and make all the swings shown on the film. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.933
 There is another major change 

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.500
 Now, everyone can save the battle video! Long live! 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.333
 So just attach a combat video to your email! You no longer have to worry about YouTube anymore. 

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.833
 Don't forget to check the "Save Battle Video" option in "Options" 

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.267
 The gospel of players who are not yet proficient in controlling operations 

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:27.167
 For those who make great efforts and stage a spectacular performance, we still reward 

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.967
 Finally, the prizes have also changed a lot. 

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:36.167
 Now if you can successfully complete the flight route in the fastest time, you will receive 6000 gold coins as a reward. 

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:41.467
 Other players who finish a little slower for a few seconds will get 5,000 gold coins and more... 

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.867
 Therefore, everyone has to force themselves to win the grand prize. 

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:53.633
 The most interesting tasks and the most special failure attempt rewards are still 5000 gold coins and 1000 gold coins respectively. 

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is also possible to win extra rewards! 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.967
 Pilots, note that this is the first challenge in this category. 

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:05.967
 Therefore, the conditions for winning prizes may or may not change, depending on your reaction and response. 

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:11.767
 Last but not least, we have not forgotten the winners of the last film of the first season. 

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:16.100
 They all received rewards on time and everyone can see their names on the screen. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
 So much now 

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:23.233
 Our email is still available - tryrepeat@wargaming.net 

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:27.133
 Everyone wants to indicate the number of episodes of "Joining Stunts" in the subject of the email... 

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:34.567
 Your own nickname, your region - whether it is North America or Europe, but also the time to complete the path... or marked as "failed" 

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:38.367
 We look forward to your video game and comments on the new program mode. 

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:40.033
 Come on!
