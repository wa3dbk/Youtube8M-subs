which<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:21.990> there

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.490 

give<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.040> 128<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.840> haven't<00:01:28.229> got<00:01:28.290> that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.179 
but with new revisions coming out
quarter<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.380> 2009

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
quarter for 2009

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.910 
quarter for 2009
I'm<00:02:02.640> sure<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.479> effects<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> program<00:02:04.710> will

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
I'm sure the effects on the program will

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.760 
I'm sure the effects on the program will
start<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.310> correlate<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:05.729> these<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
start to correlate with these here the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.380 
start to correlate with these here the
effect<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> bottom<00:02:08.489> breakdown<00:02:09.149> from<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
effect on the bottom breakdown from the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:20.220 
effect on the bottom breakdown from the
verse<00:02:09.539> still<00:02:09.780> work

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.500 

which<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.380> nice<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:22.120> read<00:02:23.120> sets<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
which is nice that read sets the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.150 
which is nice that read sets the
keyboard<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.960> be<00:02:24.050> somebody<00:02:24.380> down<00:02:24.470> want<00:02:24.710> it<00:02:24.890> but

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
keyboard to be somebody down want it but

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.590 
keyboard to be somebody down want it but
never<00:02:25.310> mind

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
never mind

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.880 
never mind
a<00:02:26.630> final<00:02:27.410> trim<00:02:27.680> really<00:02:28.520> click<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.820> on<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.200> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
a final trim really click it on and you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:41.550 
a final trim really click it on and you
can<00:02:30.950> start<00:02:31.870> set<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.960> cue<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.470> off<00:02:33.800> again

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.680 

so<00:02:42.560> pretty<00:02:43.040> much<00:02:43.220> everything<00:02:43.640> still<00:02:44.150> works<00:02:44.180> on

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so pretty much everything still works on

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.710 
so pretty much everything still works on
the<00:02:44.750> HD<00:02:45.620> 2500<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.760> should<00:02:46.940> do<00:02:47.150> compared<00:02:47.660> to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the HD 2500 as it should do compared to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.870 
the HD 2500 as it should do compared to
use<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.200> natively<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:49.100> sort<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> scratch

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
use it natively with sort of a scratch

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.780 
use it natively with sort of a scratch
live<00:02:50.120> pitch<00:02:50.780> pen<00:02:51.020> still<00:02:51.260> works<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:52.640> can
