here<00:00:00.480> we<00:00:00.810> are<00:00:00.840> with<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.589> top<00:00:02.190> pin<00:00:02.399> ready<00:00:02.639> now

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
here we are with the top pin ready now

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.329 
here we are with the top pin ready now
MacBook<00:00:03.240> Pro<00:00:03.510> she's<00:00:03.929> running<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> 2.7<00:00:05.190> yeah

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
MacBook Pro she's running on a 2.7 yeah

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.900 
MacBook Pro she's running on a 2.7 yeah
it's<00:00:05.990> Intel<00:00:06.990> quad<00:00:07.740> core<00:00:07.770> processor<00:00:08.340> i7

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
it's Intel quad core processor i7

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.570 
it's Intel quad core processor i7
processor<00:00:09.300> back<00:00:10.200> 16<00:00:10.650> GB<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.920> RAM<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:12.259> as<00:00:13.580> 768

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
processor back 16 GB of RAM and as 768

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.109 
processor back 16 GB of RAM and as 768
GB<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> storage<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.789> final<00:00:17.789> cut

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
GB of storage so this is the final cut

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
GB of storage so this is the final cut
Sakura<00:00:18.990> they're<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> export<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
Sakura they're not going to export a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.099 
Sakura they're not going to export a
video<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.830> configuration<00:00:22.830> so

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
video so this is the configuration so

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.060 
video so this is the configuration so
let's<00:00:25.109> quickly<00:00:25.619> hit<00:00:25.920> export<00:00:26.670> from<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:28.070> share

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
let's quickly hit export from the share

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.510 
let's quickly hit export from the share
middle<00:00:29.609> half<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.420> shot<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.990> video<00:00:31.380> air<00:00:31.619> power

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
middle half a shot to video air power

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.920 
middle half a shot to video air power
export<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> short<00:00:38.460> video

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
export so it's going to be a short video

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.810 
export so it's going to be a short video
720p<00:00:39.930> HD<00:00:40.739> video<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.340> exporting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
720p HD video I'm going to be exporting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.720 
720p HD video I'm going to be exporting
it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:43.649> says<00:00:43.920> call<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> Qualcomm<00:00:45.149> 3<00:00:46.730> or

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it and it says call it Qualcomm 3 or

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
it and it says call it Qualcomm 3 or
they<00:00:47.969> were<00:00:48.090> working<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.600> something<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.379> let's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
they were working on something so let's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.150 
they were working on something so let's
hit<00:00:50.039> save

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.380 

so<00:00:54.880> it<00:00:55.210> says<00:00:55.950> 70<00:00:56.950> seconds<00:00:57.520> remaining<00:00:57.820> as<00:00:58.180> on

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
so it says 70 seconds remaining as on

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.270 
so it says 70 seconds remaining as on
top<00:00:58.570> in<00:00:58.720> minutes<00:00:59.080> but<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.530> seconds<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:00.250> just

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
top in minutes but in seconds we just

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.760 
top in minutes but in seconds we just
kind<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:01.110> press<00:01:02.110> it<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.520> 10%<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.420> already<00:01:04.690> done

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.529 

says<00:01:09.340> about<00:01:09.640> 88<00:01:10.180> seconds<00:01:10.659> remaining<00:01:11.020> now<00:01:12.539> I'm

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
says about 88 seconds remaining now I'm

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.870 
says about 88 seconds remaining now I'm
sure<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.840> temperature<00:01:14.469> of<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.950> GPU<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.789> the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
sure the temperature of the GPU and the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.880 
sure the temperature of the GPU and the
CPU<00:01:15.969> must<00:01:16.719> be<00:01:17.280> heating<00:01:18.280> up<00:01:18.570> high<00:01:19.570> level<00:01:19.899> now<00:01:20.049> so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
CPU must be heating up high level now so

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.690 
CPU must be heating up high level now so
let's<00:01:21.100> take<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.670> look<00:01:21.850> at<00:01:21.969> that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.770 

so<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.330> GPUs<00:01:28.840> hit<00:01:29.380> about<00:01:29.740> 76<00:01:30.340> degrees<00:01:30.780> degree

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
so the GPUs hit about 76 degrees degree

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.950 
so the GPUs hit about 76 degrees degree
Celsius<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.370> take<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.790> CPU<00:01:34.330> usage<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
Celsius and you take the CPU usage is

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.429 
Celsius and you take the CPU usage is
about<00:01:35.640> 70%

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.219 

so<00:01:43.130> let's<00:01:43.429> go<00:01:43.609> back<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.179> vacation<00:01:44.929> so<00:01:45.079> that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
so let's go back to the vacation so that

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.760 
so let's go back to the vacation so that
says<00:01:45.439> about<00:01:45.649> physics<00:01:46.189> seconds<00:01:46.729> remaining<00:01:47.770> 55

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
says about physics seconds remaining 55

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.569 
says about physics seconds remaining 55
54<00:01:49.579> 53<00:01:49.869> what<00:01:50.869> 50%<00:01:51.469> was<00:01:51.560> done<00:01:51.799> but<00:01:52.369> halfway

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
54 53 what 50% was done but halfway

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:16.600 
54 53 what 50% was done but halfway
through<00:01:52.789> now

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:25.700 

so<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.180> about<00:02:17.420> 80%<00:02:18.080> done<00:02:18.590> now

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:38.140 

80%<00:02:26.670> done

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.009 

and<00:02:38.480> boom<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.410> done<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.580> that's<00:02:40.849> Final<00:02:41.810> Cut

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
and boom it's done so that's Final Cut

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.309 
and boom it's done so that's Final Cut
