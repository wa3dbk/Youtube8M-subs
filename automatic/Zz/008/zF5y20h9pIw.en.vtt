00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.250 

I<00:00:42.040> like<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.790> race<00:00:42.970> I<00:00:43.300> like<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.840> two<00:00:44.020> weeks

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
I like the race I like the two weeks

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.080 
I like the race I like the two weeks
there<00:00:44.560> it's<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:44.950> great<00:00:45.190> challenge<00:00:45.430> physically

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
there it's a great challenge physically

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.800 
there it's a great challenge physically
mentally<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:47.310> mechanically<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:49.600> time

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
mentally and mechanically first time

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.490 
mentally and mechanically first time
with<00:00:49.990> a<00:00:50.020> movie<00:00:50.380> first<00:00:51.310> time<00:00:51.550> with<00:00:51.730> chemo<00:00:52.060> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
with a movie first time with chemo and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.530 
with a movie first time with chemo and
here<00:00:53.500> we<00:00:53.650> are<00:00:53.770> again<00:00:53.920> ready<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.790> think<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.420> a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
here we are again ready I think it's a

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.080 
here we are again ready I think it's a
nice<00:00:55.720> nice<00:00:56.140> event<00:00:56.440> once<00:00:57.280> per<00:00:57.520> year<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.970> have

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
nice nice event once per year you have

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.660 
nice nice event once per year you have
only<00:00:58.239> one<00:00:58.360> chance<00:00:58.750> in<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.230> year<00:00:59.530> last<00:01:00.520> year

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
only one chance in the year last year

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.900 
only one chance in the year last year
car<00:01:01.540> was<00:01:01.780> very<00:01:02.140> good<00:01:02.410> on<00:01:02.559> my<00:01:02.710> overall<00:01:03.070> all<00:01:03.730> the

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
car was very good on my overall all the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.090 
car was very good on my overall all the
good<00:01:04.089> mix<00:01:04.300> between<00:01:04.660> everything<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.740> they<00:01:05.920> go

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
good mix between everything and they go

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.620 
good mix between everything and they go
past<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.610> off-road<00:01:06.880> but<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.360> will<00:01:07.510> can

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
past in the off-road but you will can

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.260 
past in the off-road but you will can
also<00:01:07.840> go<00:01:08.080> fast<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.650> on<00:01:09.220> gravel<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.820> twisting

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
also go fast on on gravel on twisting

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.840 
also go fast on on gravel on twisting
double<00:01:10.420> rows<00:01:10.780> which<00:01:11.020> makes<00:01:11.800> you<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.490> bit<00:01:12.820> more

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
double rows which makes you a bit more

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.630 
double rows which makes you a bit more
safe<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:14.080> obviously<00:01:14.500> when<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.070> are<00:01:15.190> driving<00:01:15.400> a

safe so obviously when you are driving a
buoy<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:16.150> would<00:01:16.690> like<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.110> have<00:01:17.259> many

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710

to be able to push in the dunes do not

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
to be able to push in the dunes do not

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
need to take care about temperature you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.889 
need to take care about temperature you
know<00:01:41.040> always

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.899 

we<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.350> our<00:01:49.380> advantage<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.790> those

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
we have all our advantage one of those

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
we have all our advantage one of those
ones<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> system<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> inflate<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
ones is the system to inflate and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.810 
ones is the system to inflate and
deflate<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.659> tires<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> inside<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
deflate the tires from the inside that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.870 
deflate the tires from the inside that
this<00:01:57.000> job<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.930> front<00:01:58.920> emo<00:01:59.130> maybe<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.670> can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this job from front emo maybe you can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.429 
this job from front emo maybe you can
explain<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.210> little<00:02:00.450> bit<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.840> how<00:02:01.049> does<00:02:01.289> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
explain a little bit more how does it

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
explain a little bit more how does it
work<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.250> quite<00:02:02.820> nice<00:02:03.000> system<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
work it's a quite nice system so you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.330 
work it's a quite nice system so you
don't<00:02:03.869> need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> stop<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.740> reduce<00:02:05.070> tire

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
don't need to stop it to reduce tire

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.150 
don't need to stop it to reduce tire
pressure<00:02:06.140> because<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.320> place<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
pressure because you place we can do it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.249 
pressure because you place we can do it
from<00:02:08.340> inside<00:02:08.369> while<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.599> driving<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
from inside while you are driving so you

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.780 
from inside while you are driving so you
don't<00:02:10.470> lose<00:02:10.649> any<00:02:10.890> time

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.500 

FEMA<00:02:17.629> has<00:02:17.659> really<00:02:18.469> good<00:02:18.590> experience<00:02:19.299> in<00:02:20.299> the
