00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 so today we will talk about how 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.480
 draw eyes or for many it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 pretty complicated process start 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.320
 just drawing eyes ending 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.070
 decorating in other words 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.010
 use and chiaroscuro and scenic 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.310
 tools for transferring volume and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.309
 colors and using the tablet to do it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 also easy when a piece of paper you 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.239
 know what i'm drawing on the tablet 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.590
 intuos pro from wac if you need 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.430
 helping one to pick oneself 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.019
 suitable tablet check out this video and 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 right now on the screen drew class 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.000
 likes against and need to understand that the eye 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.670
 by itself this is the main thing apples is a ball 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.769
 this fundamental knowledge is necessary 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 remember when we draw because 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.180
 This will help them decorating also 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.400
 remember dawn most likely drew 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 when it is an exercise like a ball 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.830
 the sphere on it is light and the shadows are the same laws 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.200
 lighting applicable to the eyeball but 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.170
 here's another thing in the iris area 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.439
 there is such a kind of bulge as 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.020
 see she goes beyond the ocular 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.479
 Apple is a special structure of our eyes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.280
 and on this area of ​​the manual shell too 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.280
 acting his lawfully priest 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.280
 yes moment drawing belt who 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.260
 naturally not visible eyes 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.600
 rather than draw through and they will show us 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.030
 a sense of volume and how you see for centuries 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.340
 closed most of the eyeball then 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.830
 have we not see him there is not 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.250
 only closed century I find at night in 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.010
 the depth of the orbit and if you notice i 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.480
 drew such a small step from 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 century house 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.570
 eyeball you see right here on 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.870
 more detailed view of this one is small 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.790
 step is the thickness of the century and now 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.040
 black color, I slightly emphasize 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.200
 contours and will highlight this half-man 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.050
 and you need not forget that even with this 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.870
 As a profile, we still see how 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.040
 the thickness of the century it kind of wraps up 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.530
 around the circumference 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.660
 because you and I have a round eye 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.450
 and bulk space and the same 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.560
 happens to the upper eyelid she too like 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.470
 we're wrapped up missing a bunker 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.480
 and of course it sounds all very strange and 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.090
 incomprehensible therefore the more you will 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.520
 draw from life the more you understand 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.290
 it will be without any strange explain 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 and back in the intro course then what are you 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.830
 show who is this volume and with 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.959
 these imaginary 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.940
 axes that indicate that the top 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.650
 part of the fixed century on 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.300
 a little stuffed and how i start the process 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.100
 adding colors and drawing now 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.050
 I do with a graphic tablet 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.660
 as you might have noticed when you 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.690
 draw such details as cilia or 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.030
 glare or something else was very important 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.760
 gain good sensitivity 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.060
 and your working idle high resolution 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.650
 about 300 dps to avoid 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.420
 pixelation on fine details for everything 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.950
 this process almost all the time 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.560
 using the same brush 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.990
 adjusting only by pressing the pen 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.720
 not only the transparency settings but also 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.470
 the strength and pressure you put on your pen can 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.820
 make it lighter or darker and to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.520
 it is better to demonstrate why 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.570
 so the color of the shadow falls down draws big 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.640
 an eye like that ball of exercise that is 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.490
 as you can see on this bulb it 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.280
 own shadow and plus more on our 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.250
 the eye will have a falling shadow from the top 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.350
 century and lower eyelid and for the same 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.210
 principle decided to make the pupil first 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.780
 completely draw and then I have you 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.459
 hiding under our centuries our rainbow 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.290
 the shell has a very interesting 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.190
 structure if you look very 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.540
 close on the human eye you will see 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.890
 a lot of thin streaks 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.500
 and between them 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 the space we see as dark 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.150
 lines on the iris and if you 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.700
 I have never seen with my eyes 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.459
 macro shots here are some pictures 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.410
 so today you could not sleep I 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.090
 returning our painted eyes and 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.780
 add some celebrated y 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.450
 another color can now actually not be 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.240
 erase too much and add a drop shadow 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.240
 from the upper eyelids to a different shell and 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.090
 I have now deleted an agreement on black 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.150
 a throat random doesn't just need me 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.360
 I will draw Jack Black jogging contest 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.160
 scarves and the need arose 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.710
 a little bit already 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.740
 the eye section just turned out like that 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.640
 too wide too opening pilot and 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.100
 Now I add a sense of volume behind 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.530
 account that each element add 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.030
 thickness and here is the thickness of the century about 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.310
 which we were talking about 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.100
 in this case, we see the thickness of the bottom 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.050
 centuries more it is more revealed to us 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.060
 than the thickness of the upper eyelid 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.880
 again because the upper eyelid will 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.100
 write with your elbow no more shadow of it 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.790
 puppy expected authors 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.920
 orbits closed eyelashes and now given from 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.710
 the falling shadow from the very eye which 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.510
 falls on the brush and for the eyelashes I choose 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.230
 ordinary brush a little bit 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.810
 harder 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.780
 and on a separate word draw eyelashes 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.690
 In this case, you can adjust the pressure and 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.460
 tilt the pen in order to achieve 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.480
 better direction effect 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.760
 but here you can also improve the shadows and 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.280
 contours to the previous layer where we slept 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.110
 eye and as you can see i lashes i 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.690
 I ask a little bit native direction they 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.470
 I do not have them as everyone is equal 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.260
 they are boy mind and i do black 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.230
 not so bright to make a feeling 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.570
 natural eyelashes and add here and there 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.810
 black just for natural shade for 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.260
 amplification and sometimes when everything is very smooth 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.760
 and beautifully shaded want to add 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.280
 hand hatching how you do it on 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.560
 paper forget to add a drop shadow 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.560
 from eyelashes from lower lashes it will be 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.510
 falling shadows on the lower eyelid from the upper 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.380
 eyelashes she will fall on the eye 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:22.230
 give me an apple but such interesting 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.300
 lines and when I turn public not 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.550
 forget that this flare is formed 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.200
 when the sun shines through eyelashes too 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.810
 so therefore will have such 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.900
 silhouette and when the surface of our eyes 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.850
 glossy everything that is in the surrounding 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.400
 and can reflect on this eyes and 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.199
 let me finish this video on it 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.320
 and I hope that it was useful for you 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:51.039
 and today we talked about he share 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.259
 pro then actually preteen graveyard light 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.570
 and bicky basic tools like 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:58.419
 achieve this or that as you see 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:02.080
 there are no super special effects and 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:04.690
 no secrets and therefore repeat 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.150
 what I said more than once to friends 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.900
 my draw more from nature and understanding 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:13.690
 anatomy and color and site shadows are all 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.550
 will come to you naturally if 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.889
 you are interested in more such lessons on 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.539
 my channel put this video like 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.770
 subscribe and share with friends 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.770
