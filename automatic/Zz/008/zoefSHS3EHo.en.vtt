00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
thing it's got really working for it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.090 
thing it's got really working for it
besides<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> fact<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> little

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
besides the fact that it's got a little

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369

bit less going on on the outside is that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.529 
bit less going on on the outside is that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
it doesn't have those buckles and that

we're talking about the toe box I'm
going<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.500> split<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:40.890> next<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.490> my<00:02:41.550> left

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
going to split it right next to my left

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.160 
going to split it right next to my left
side<00:02:42.000> boot<00:02:42.240> one<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.690> things<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.960> can

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
side boot one of the things that I can

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.420 
side boot one of the things that I can
I'm<00:02:43.230> starting<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.530> do<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.770> their<00:02:43.890> new<00:02:44.010> boots<00:02:44.250> is

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
I'm starting to do in their new boots is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.010 
I'm starting to do in their new boots is
they're<00:02:44.700> only<00:02:44.850> giving<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.270> shift<00:02:45.600> pad<00:02:45.810> on

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the side that you shift on I think it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.190 
the side that you shift on I think it
adds<00:02:48.300> interest<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> boot<00:02:49.050> it's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
adds interest to the boot it's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.480 
adds interest to the boot it's
asymmetrical<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.070> doesn't<00:02:50.340> look<00:02:50.460> like

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
asymmetrical and it doesn't look like

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.280 
asymmetrical and it doesn't look like
you<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.760> some<00:02:51.030> weird<00:02:51.240> bike<00:02:51.510> that's<00:02:51.750> reversed

you have some weird bike that's reversed

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410 
you have some weird bike that's reversed
or<00:02:52.740> it's<00:02:52.830> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> change<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.670> again

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
or it's going to change on you again

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.970
