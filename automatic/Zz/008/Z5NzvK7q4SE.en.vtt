00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:13.309
 good not what happened here bough breaks 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.309
 was in the 20km of alfenas and the 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.869
 now it smells broke when the full 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.650
 it broke 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.180
 everything went right back and not 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.900
 had more like put had no more 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.570
 How to pedal everything here, then one 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.250
 Make sure you get back home. 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.949
 It was the following I took the exchange 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:51.610
 back put back squatted for whom she 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:55.120
 help tighten here in the locking wheel 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.450
 and I took the chain 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.150
 I did not reduce the current 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.040
 I searched for a relationship in the middle 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.440
 I used the middle crown on the fourth or fifth 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.080
 behind to avoid getting a relationship or 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.850
 very light and not too heavy and also 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.050
 does not leave a twisted chain because now 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.460
 there is no more 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.790
 indicator is part of the field that 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.450
 is an indicator of current to 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:34.330
 To do this I only used this 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:43.380
 set in key is too small 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:43.380
 carry in the pocket easily for 40 and 50 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:58.330
 I used this key and also 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:06.630
 is that it has the key room in which I 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.630
 I needed to get the corner of the fair 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.450
 of course it is a palliative measure 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.030
 just to come home to train a 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.880
 do not spin enough without having to 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.880
 shift gears to it
