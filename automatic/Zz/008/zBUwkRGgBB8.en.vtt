00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.390 
this is my half x 'if defense is no
different<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:13.800> i'm<00:05:13.890> not<00:05:14.010> going<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.220> show<00:05:14.340> you

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
different so i'm not going to show you

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.990 
different so i'm not going to show you
that<00:05:14.550> again<00:05:15.530> but<00:05:16.530> here's<00:05:17.370> why<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.760> is

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
that again but here's why this is

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.360 
that again but here's why this is
special<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.900> because<00:05:19.110> as<00:05:19.890> you<00:05:20.070> can<00:05:20.100> see<00:05:20.250> a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
special is because as you can see a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.080 
special is because as you can see a
beast<00:05:20.970> mode<00:05:21.330> in<00:05:21.690> at<00:05:22.620> first<00:05:22.980> at<00:05:23.490> my<00:05:23.550> running

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
beast mode in at first at my running

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.720 
beast mode in at first at my running
back<00:05:24.530> that's<00:05:25.530> because<00:05:25.860> he's<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.040> terrible<00:05:26.490> wide

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
back that's because he's a terrible wide

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.810 
back that's because he's a terrible wide
receiver<00:05:27.300> what<00:05:27.810> i<00:05:27.840> mean<00:05:28.020> by<00:05:28.080> that<00:05:28.260> is<00:05:28.620> yes<00:05:29.610> i'm

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820
