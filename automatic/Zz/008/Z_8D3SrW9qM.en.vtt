00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.449

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.330
 a small knife a cookie cutter and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.580
 small pieces of paperboard we will have 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.189
 previously cut according to the forms 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.070
 that you want so there we have the heart and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.149
 the fish you need a leaf 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.070
 cellophane like these rules in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.649
 plastic or wooden iron 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.540
 I'm going to train him to the rule in 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.430
 wood you if you have no rule in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 wood you can do to the pallet while 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.770
 simply to make a good lowering 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.230
 flat and regular and last 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 chocolate of course a chocolate put to the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.469
 point between 52 and cast iron 29 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 cooling and 31 degrees for the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.989
 focus 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.910
 so once you've done your test of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.030
 cover to have a beautiful shiny 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 fluid cover it is showered on its 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.080
 leaf these lots whose stall is the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.080
 pallet with either a queen 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.730
 so before the chocolate is taken again 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.730
 we remove the rules 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:45.060
 we take these utensils so it costs 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.620
 stencil takes away piece if you want 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.540
 make small chocolate discs 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.220
 to then put a foam at 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 chocolate between the two disks and make 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.600

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.360

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.560
 a little a knife tip 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.290
 after all depends on your imagination 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.800
 everything depends on the times of the year for 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.690
 create small disks of different 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.190
 forms in this way of doing things for 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.610
 decorate your cakes there is no 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 limit 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.860
 if you do not have time to do 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.920
 stencils you just take your blade from 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.520
 knife 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.640

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.950
 cellophane and we get a chocolate 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.560

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.720
 cellophane is removed one recovers his 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:11.090
 little susceptible subject so I'm 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:13.070

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.470
