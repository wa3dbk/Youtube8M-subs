00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.690 

you<00:05:54.150> go<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:55.289> wherever<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.770> downloaded<00:05:56.070> the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
Sonic Adventure 2 battle power is some

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.680 
Sonic Adventure 2 battle power is some
and<00:06:02.030> you<00:06:03.030> run<00:06:03.360> it

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
and you run it

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.950 
and you run it
so<00:06:04.020> let<00:06:04.320> us<00:06:04.350> running<00:06:05.419> go<00:06:06.419> ahead<00:06:06.600> and<00:06:06.720> tell<00:06:06.870> you

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
so let us running go ahead and tell you

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.740 
so let us running go ahead and tell you
that<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:07.560> basically<00:06:07.800> all<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.880> have<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.300> do<00:06:09.450> is

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
that so basically all you have to do is

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.050 
that so basically all you have to do is
you<00:06:10.050> start<00:06:10.320> up<00:06:10.500> PSP<00:06:10.950> destined<00:06:11.460> you<00:06:11.669> start<00:06:11.970> up

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
you start up PSP destined you start up

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.750 
you start up PSP destined you start up
from<00:06:12.180> your<00:06:12.270> TSP<00:06:12.710> it'll<00:06:13.710> basically<00:06:13.950> transfer

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
from your TSP it'll basically transfer

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.310 
from your TSP it'll basically transfer
the<00:06:14.880> link<00:06:15.120> you<00:06:15.240> can<00:06:15.419> either<00:06:15.539> do<00:06:15.660> is<00:06:15.780> you<00:06:15.900> USB<00:06:16.200> a

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
the link you can either do is you USB a

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.740 
the link you can either do is you USB a
Wi-Fi<00:06:16.800> I<00:06:16.830> recommend<00:06:17.610> USB<00:06:17.970> for<00:06:18.180> performance

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
Wi-Fi I recommend USB for performance

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.110 
Wi-Fi I recommend USB for performance
and<00:06:20.720> basically<00:06:21.720> it<00:06:22.229> runs<00:06:22.680> Dreamcast<00:06:23.310> just

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
and basically it runs Dreamcast just

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.469 
and basically it runs Dreamcast just
like<00:06:24.270> this<00:06:24.419> so<00:06:24.979> after<00:06:25.979> you<00:06:26.610> do<00:06:26.760> that<00:06:26.789> you<00:06:27.450> just

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
like this so after you do that you just

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.659 
like this so after you do that you just
grab<00:06:27.870> your<00:06:27.960> PSP<00:06:28.260> any<00:06:28.530> play

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669
