00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 the cheapest smartphones have evolved 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 enough in the last years before this 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 class was made up of devices that evil 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.269
 the system without locking but 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 currently, especially after the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 launch of z 2014 without handset 51 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.750
 to increase the quality level of 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.029
 basic models a good part of our list 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.910
 includes smartphones that serve very well 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 basic and intermediate users 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.359
 we separate the ten models that most 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.579
 attracted attention in 2014 and cost 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.510
 up to 800 reais in the official table 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.430
 check out the most basic model of the line 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.379
 bike has one of the best screens in this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 price range beyond performance 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.250
 enough to not hinder the daily 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.350
 This is because the engine comes with the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.449
 pure implementation of android with less 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 weight on the configuration including 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.129
 has update to version 5.0 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.050
 lollipop android guaranteed for us 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 engine is the best starting point for 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.410
 who will get their first android 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 since any model that swallows less 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 of what it offers really is not worth it 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 except for very few exceptions with price 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.869
 quite attractive and fell quite a bit 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.490
 in recent months it can be 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.030
 considered the best option in the segment 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030
 input 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.180
 the lumia 630 is not the most 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.460
 affordable nokia but comes with a price 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.350
 extremely attractive for what it offers 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.970
 it brings a quadcore processor with 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.090
 performance to run the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.710
 windows phone 8.1 even with only 512 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 megabytes of ram 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.920
 it is the equivalent of motorcycle and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.600
 platform windows phone the point 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.399
 match that the user must keep in mind 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.360
 for a good experience of use in the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.399
 platform 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 the lumia 530 is cheaper but 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.179
 we believe that the price difference does not 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.670
 justifies acquiring it better 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.470
 start with the lumia 630 as soon as 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.170
 offers a higher cost- benefit 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.720
 the device was announced for 599 reais 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 but can already be found for less than 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.869
 half price or even free with the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.659
 operator plan the business both the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.950
 next step of the nokia lumia 730 and here 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 we have already spoken of an intermediary 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.180
 he is smart enough to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.459
 who does not mind a top of the line 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.239
 and has almost no flaws in the segment 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.730
 where is it 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.310
 it comes with an oled screen of 4.7 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.739
 inch HD resolution and an excellent 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.720
 quality in its two cameras one of 6 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.420
 thousand to 7 megapixels in the back and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 another 5 megapixels and front has 8 gb 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.310
 internal memory and supports expansion 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.989
 for more 128 gigabytes with micro card 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.120
 sd plus several other points 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.920
 interesting to be the smartphone 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.989
 complete was only missing a 4g version 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.730
 but considering the price range that 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.569
 it can be found it would suck 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.569
 require this 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.780
 the illustrious relatively unknown the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.640
 nokia x1 is or was it already carol that now does 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.110
 part of microsoft one of the first 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.340
 company's attempts to enter the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.470
 android platform 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.050
 it is quite simple as the 4 screen 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.750
 4GB of internal memory and 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.220
 1GHz dual core processor is one 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.930
 option for those who like the look of 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.330
 windows phone but do not want to give up 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.130
 android even though it is up to speed 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.740
 considering the configuration it rotates a 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.600
 old version of android 4.1 jelly 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.850
 bean and this is one of the main flaws 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.860
 but it is a device with good 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.150
 quality that is worth considering already 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.150
 that its cost is quite affordable 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.990
 the basicÃ£o da sony has a price quite 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.380
 handy and quad core processor of 1.2 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.610
 ghz with 1 gb of ram is a 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.440
 excellent option for those looking for a 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.960
 model with the version you want from the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.850
 android the great differentials of e3 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.830
 include the ability to record 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.020
 1080p with its 5-way rear camera 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.560
 megapixels and the fact of coming in two 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.570
 versions a dual chip and another 4g besides 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.220
 bring a build quality up 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.220
 of the average in this price range 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.940
 the positive launched the s 480 as an option 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.840
 cheapest of the first engine 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.760
 generation 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.650
 the result is very good considering that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.780
 It is a performance input device 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.250
 it's what the camera is even better than 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.550
 We expected that the price is quite 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.140
 accessible west 480 is for those who seek the 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.150
 basic android at a good cost 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.710
 benefit even if it is one more 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.240
 input model than a competitor 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.650
 serious engine g 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.600
 but it is important to consider that it 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.140
 comes close and listening to the price of a 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.140
 motorcycle 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:37.300
 l lg 80 the best device in the line 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.070
 basic of lg little thing behind her and 90 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.259
 it comes with a 5- inch screen with 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.750
 acceptable quality good autonomy 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.009
 battery and a good number of connections 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.600
 but it is important to note that the 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.289
 performance is not one of the strengths of 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.389
 appliance 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.580
 his price range the camera enough 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.889
 accessible it comes with support for two 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 chips something much sought after 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.580
 by Brazilian users 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.300
 l prime can be considered a 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.130
 advanced version of r 80 with a screen 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.949
 the most powerful processor with 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.259
 four-core running the 1.3 ghz camera 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.770
 of 8 megapixels and storage of 8 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.750
 gigabytes versus 4 gigabytes lg80 is worth 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.370
 who is willing to invest a 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.650
 little more to get a good 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.389
 amount of resources than is 80 and 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.310
 likes lg smartphones 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.570
 Yes, especially for being possible. 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.880
 find it at very affordable prices 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.539
 with a slight difference from the 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.539
 r 80 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.440
 one of the most successful smartphones in the 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.030
 brasil received an update this year 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.620
 with few differences in relation to 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.449
 previous version but still 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.370
 extremely interesting inside your 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.289
 cost-effective price range 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.909
 almost unbeatable compared to most 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.979
 of dual chip models 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.699
 the 2014 engine has 5 inch screen 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.710
 hd processor with quad-core processor and a 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.050
 8 megapixel camera capable of answering 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.759
 very well in casual photos is one of the 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.889
 better buy options for those who do not 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.599
 want to invest a lot in a smartphone but 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.599
 You also do not want to give up so much 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.480
 Finally we have symphony 5 that 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.889
 debuted the smartphone segment of 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.810
 Asus in Brazil with marketing. 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.610
 extremely aggressive and cost 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.010
 benefit ratio as good as or even 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.320
 higher than the 2014 engine 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.600
 The price of the iphone 5 is attractive in its 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.060
 two versions with performance to spare 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.710
 8-megapixel master pixel camera and 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.360
 with support for two chips 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.190
 The only problem we saw in him was the 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.000
 its autonomy slightly below the 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.620
 expected 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.540
 but considering its price 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.979
 launch is really hard to find 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.690
 a competitor to the 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.080
 these were the top ten smartphones 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.940
 2014 in our opinion tomorrow 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 you see our list of 10 Mars headphones 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.150
 intermediates 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.350
 stay connected and if you liked short here in 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.360
