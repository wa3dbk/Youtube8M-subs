do<00:00:58.680> next<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.670> find<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> asinine

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
do next which I find kind of asinine

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.209 
do next which I find kind of asinine
because<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.920> they<00:01:02.190> would

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
because you would think that they would

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.600

at<00:01:02.399> least<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> keep<00:01:03.989> FCW<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:05.129> until

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
at least you know keep FCW going until

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.190 
at least you know keep FCW going until
they<00:01:05.790> figure<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.630> wanted<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> do

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
they figure out what they wanted to do

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
they figure out what they wanted to do
apparently<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.070> want<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.000> some

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

form of developmental system and to be

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
before FCW was tons better not just

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.789 
before FCW was tons better not just
because<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.210> produced<00:01:36.780> guys<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.590> they

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
of a BS argument in my opinion but

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
of a BS argument in my opinion but
really<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.960> know<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
really you know it you know this is a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
really you know it you know this is a
story<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.850> fact<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:24.660> are

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
story in the fact that you know they are

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.550 
story in the fact that you know they are
closing<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.680> FCW<00:02:26.990> but<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:30.200> until<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.320> I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
closing down FCW but you know until we I

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.170 
closing down FCW but you know until we I
guess<00:02:31.710> until<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.160> know<00:02:32.310> exactly<00:02:32.340> what's<00:02:33.090> going

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
guess until we know exactly what's going

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.570 
guess until we know exactly what's going
on<00:02:33.600> there's<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.380> much<00:02:34.590> else<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> say<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.250> will

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
on there's not much else to say I will

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.400 
on there's not much else to say I will
say<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:39.410> w's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
say this that you know I think the w's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.460 
say this that you know I think the w's
developmental<00:02:40.980> program<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.520> complete<00:02:41.970> crap

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
developmental program is complete crap

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.900 
developmental program is complete crap
FCW<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.770> complete<00:02:44.100> crap<00:02:44.340> i<00:02:44.400> think<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> can

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
FCW is complete crap i think you can

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.160 
FCW is complete crap i think you can
point<00:02:45.240> out<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> fact<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.810> they<00:02:45.990> probably

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
point out the fact that they probably

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.010 
point out the fact that they probably
made<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.920> lot<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.280> guys<00:02:47.520> worse<00:02:47.970> once<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:48.840> got

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
made a lot of guys worse once they got

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.130 
made a lot of guys worse once they got
there<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.790> guess<00:02:51.240> Harris<00:02:51.630> would<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
there then I guess Harris would be the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.310 
there then I guess Harris would be the
the<00:02:52.410> best<00:02:52.650> example<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:54.660> God<00:02:54.870> or<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the best example of that of God or you

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.110 
the best example of that of God or you
know<00:02:55.440> any<00:02:55.680> number<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.010> guys<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.250> would<00:02:56.670> go

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
know any number of guys that would go

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.060 
know any number of guys that would go
there<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.390> would<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.410> know<00:02:58.500> who<00:02:58.650> were<00:02:58.800> good

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
there and would you know who were good

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.770 
there and would you know who were good
then<00:02:59.340> people<00:02:59.640> would<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.820> like<00:02:59.910> wow<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.570> was<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
then people would be like wow this was a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.320 
then people would be like wow this was a
good<00:03:00.990> guy<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.560> go<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.800> FCW<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.970> then<00:03:03.060> would

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
good guy and we go to FCW and then would

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.020 
good guy and we go to FCW and then would
you'd<00:03:03.720> see<00:03:03.990> him<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.200> TV<00:03:04.380> finally<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.490> he<00:03:05.880> was

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
you'd see him on TV finally and he was

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.490 
you'd see him on TV finally and he was
horrible<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.750> was<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:07.020> what<00:03:07.320> happened

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
horrible and it was like what happened

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
horrible and it was like what happened
to<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.890> guy<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.880> happened<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.300> more

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
to this guy and that happened to more

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.720 
to this guy and that happened to more
than<00:03:09.510> once<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:12.330> know<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.810> w.e<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:14.340> talent

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
than once you know just w.e just talent

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.910 
than once you know just w.e just talent
assessment<00:03:15.030> i<00:03:15.360> think<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.750> pretty<00:03:16.260> wretched<00:03:16.590> at

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
assessment i think is pretty wretched at

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.010 
assessment i think is pretty wretched at
the<00:03:17.040> moment<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:18.150> fact<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.480> they<00:03:18.600> don't<00:03:18.780> seem

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
the moment the fact that they don't seem

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.420 
the moment the fact that they don't seem
to<00:03:19.080> understand<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.740> need<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.920> diversity

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
to understand that you need a diversity

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
to understand that you need a diversity
of<00:03:20.520> guys<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.090> fact<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.420> they<00:03:21.630> they<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.320> all

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470

I<00:03:40.590> think<00:03:40.830> developmental<00:03:41.340> work<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:42.210> know

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
I think developmental work and you know

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.930 
I think developmental work and you know
for<00:03:42.780> them<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.080> have<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> developmental<00:03:44.730> system

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.110 
and I think that's you know a lot of
people<00:05:56.800> pointed<00:05:57.279> that<00:05:57.310> out<00:05:57.430> early<00:05:57.789> i'm<00:05:57.969> not

saying that you feel full balls to the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.760 
saying that you feel full balls to the
walls<00:06:00.069> crazy<00:06:00.639> you<00:06:01.569> know<00:06:01.690> dragon<00:06:02.289> gate<00:06:02.440> stuff

walls crazy you know dragon gate stuff

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.999 
walls crazy you know dragon gate stuff
but<00:06:03.699> you<00:06:04.599> know<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:04.779> do<00:06:05.110> need<00:06:05.379> you<00:06:05.800> know<00:06:05.919> i

but you know you do need you know i
think<00:06:06.159> you<00:06:06.430> can<00:06:06.550> slow<00:06:06.729> down<00:06:06.879> a<00:06:06.940> little<00:06:07.060> bit<00:06:07.210> but

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
think you can slow down a little bit but

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.209 
think you can slow down a little bit but
i<00:06:07.419> do<00:06:07.659> think<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:08.139> you<00:06:08.469> have<00:06:08.650> to<00:06:08.800> realize<00:06:09.190> that

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
i do think that you have to realize that

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.890 
i do think that you have to realize that
you<00:06:09.759> do<00:06:09.969> need<00:06:10.150> a<00:06:10.210> faster<00:06:10.870> pace<00:06:11.080> more<00:06:12.069> athletic

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.059 
fused and all sorts of other stuff i
still<00:06:32.050> think<00:06:32.169> you<00:06:32.319> can<00:06:32.409> go<00:06:32.500> out<00:06:32.620> there<00:06:32.770> and<00:06:32.889> put

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 
still think you can go out there and put

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.219 
still think you can go out there and put
on<00:06:33.190> a<00:06:33.219> product<00:06:33.550> that<00:06:33.819> is<00:06:33.969> still<00:06:34.330> relatively

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
on a product that is still relatively

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.190 
on a product that is still relatively
safe<00:06:36.539> really<00:06:37.539> safer<00:06:37.990> than<00:06:38.110> that<00:06:38.380> but<00:06:38.800> still

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
safe really safer than that but still

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.340 
safe really safer than that but still
put<00:06:40.500> on<00:06:40.620> an<00:06:40.770> exciting<00:06:41.100> in-ring<00:06:41.670> product<00:06:42.120> and<00:06:42.360> I

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
put on an exciting in-ring product and I

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.390 
put on an exciting in-ring product and I
think<00:06:43.530> that's<00:06:43.680> one<00:06:43.830> of<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:43.980> things<00:06:44.040> they're

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
think that's one of the things they're

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.860 
think that's one of the things they're
really<00:06:44.610> lacking<00:06:44.820> and<00:06:45.120> I<00:06:45.150> think<00:06:45.360> they're<00:06:45.510> not

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
really lacking and I think they're not

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.630 
really lacking and I think they're not
you<00:06:46.380> know<00:06:46.410> they're<00:06:46.620> they're<00:06:46.950> looking<00:06:47.400> for

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.310 
you know they're they're looking for
everything<00:06:48.120> but<00:06:48.330> that<00:06:48.360> I<00:06:48.570> think<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.140> reason

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
everything but that I think the reason

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.710 
everything but that I think the reason
why<00:06:49.590> is<00:06:50.400> because<00:06:50.430> I<00:06:50.730> think<00:06:50.880> if<00:06:51.000> they<00:06:51.210> look<00:06:51.450> for

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
why is because I think if they look for

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.600 
why is because I think if they look for
guys<00:06:51.810> who<00:06:51.870> have<00:06:52.200> a<00:06:52.230> wrestling<00:06:52.770> background<00:06:52.800> or
