finding it on my Roland I think was

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.220

during playthrough too near tanis's

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.970 
during playthrough too near tanis's
place<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:40.030> wrecking<00:02:40.660> face<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.800> like

place and just wrecking face for like

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.100 
place and just wrecking face for like
almost<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.520> rest<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.180> playthrough<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.900> I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
almost the rest of the playthrough so I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.440 
almost the rest of the playthrough so I
don't<00:02:44.620> know<00:02:44.710> it's<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.100> really<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:45.610> balanced

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
don't know it's a really well balanced

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.020 
don't know it's a really well balanced
out<00:02:46.600> shotgun<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.980> 20<00:02:48.310> rounds<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.790> course

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
out shotgun the 20 rounds of course

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.270 
out shotgun the 20 rounds of course
makes<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.420> stand<00:02:49.660> out<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.230> damage<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:51.160> know

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
makes it stand out the damage you know

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.770 
makes it stand out the damage you know
could<00:02:51.520> be<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> little<00:02:51.910> bit<00:02:52.030> better<00:02:52.210> but<00:02:52.510> it's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
could be a little bit better but it's

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.720 
could be a little bit better but it's
still<00:02:52.840> really<00:02:53.320> balanced<00:02:53.800> across<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.400> you

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
still really balanced across the you

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.080 
still really balanced across the you
know<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.970> board<00:02:55.210> in<00:02:55.450> terms<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.840> stats<00:02:57.090> but

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
know the board in terms of stats but

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.490 
know the board in terms of stats but
it's<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.600> weapon<00:02:58.900> where<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.350> just

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it's just a weapon where you can just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.900 
it's just a weapon where you can just
let<00:02:59.770> loose<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:00.460> what<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.700> love<00:03:00.880> about

really<00:03:37.870> any<00:03:38.020> weapon<00:03:38.470> when<00:03:38.740> I<00:03:38.770> pull<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.160> class

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
really any weapon when I pull this class

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.800 
really any weapon when I pull this class
mod<00:03:39.820> out<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:41.050> makes<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.520> much<00:03:42.550> better

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
mod out it just makes it so much better

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.060 
mod out it just makes it so much better
so<00:03:43.810> if<00:03:43.900> it's<00:03:44.050> like<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.170> crappy<00:03:44.650> weapon<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.010> could

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
so if it's like a crappy weapon I could

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.470 
so if it's like a crappy weapon I could
freaking<00:03:45.430> probably<00:03:45.700> pull<00:03:45.880> out<00:03:46.000> at<00:03:46.180> White's

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
freaking probably pull out at White's

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.210 
freaking probably pull out at White's
and<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.990> would<00:03:47.140> make<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.500> really<00:03:47.800> good<00:03:47.950> with

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
and it would make it really good with

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.850 
and it would make it really good with
this<00:03:48.370> heavy<00:03:48.700> counter<00:03:49.090> come<00:03:49.330> at<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.620> start

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
this heavy counter come at the start

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.110 
this heavy counter come at the start
though<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.070> did<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.580> support<00:03:51.970> gunner

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
though I did have the support gunner

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.390 
though I did have the support gunner
calm<00:03:52.360> which<00:03:52.540> increases<00:03:52.990> magazine<00:03:53.410> size<00:03:53.680> up<00:03:54.100> to

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
calm which increases magazine size up to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.870 
calm which increases magazine size up to
40<00:03:55.270> which<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.570> absolutely<00:03:55.990> insane<00:03:56.490> but<00:03:57.490> it<00:03:57.700> did

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
40 which is absolutely insane but it did

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.000 
40 which is absolutely insane but it did
decrease<00:03:58.120> down<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.570> what<00:03:59.050> 31<00:03:59.680> with<00:03:59.860> this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
decrease down like what 31 with this

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.620 
decrease down like what 31 with this
heavy<00:04:00.160> gunner<00:04:00.400> calm<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.060> magazine<00:04:01.420> size

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
heavy gunner calm so the magazine size

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.150 
heavy gunner calm so the magazine size
did<00:04:01.930> decrease<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.470> little<00:04:02.590> bit<00:04:02.800> but<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.040> really

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
did decrease a little bit but it really

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.590 
did decrease a little bit but it really
doesn't<00:04:03.520> matter<00:04:03.610> since<00:04:03.910> this<00:04:04.060> thing<00:04:04.270> already

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
doesn't matter since this thing already

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.680 
doesn't matter since this thing already
has<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.130> base<00:04:06.370> magazine<00:04:06.910> size<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.330> 20

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
has you know a base magazine size of 20

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.960 
has you know a base magazine size of 20
it<00:04:07.900> really<00:04:08.410> doesn't<00:04:08.709> matter<00:04:08.860> just<00:04:09.280> spray<00:04:09.850> and

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
it really doesn't matter just spray and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.040 
it really doesn't matter just spray and
pray<00:04:10.120> all<00:04:10.420> day<00:04:10.570> long

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
pray all day long

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.110 
pray all day long
but<00:04:11.709> one<00:04:12.130> thing<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.340> might<00:04:12.520> have<00:04:12.670> noticed<00:04:13.000> at

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
but one thing you might have noticed at

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.330 
but one thing you might have noticed at
the<00:04:13.209> very<00:04:13.390> beginning<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:15.130> the

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
the very beginning is that I have the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.539 
the very beginning is that I have the
hunters<00:04:15.820> prefix<00:04:16.510> on<00:04:16.780> mine<00:04:17.290> on<00:04:17.560> my<00:04:18.040> particular

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
hunters prefix on mine on my particular

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.750 
hunters prefix on mine on my particular
variation<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.810> bulldog<00:04:20.169> which<00:04:20.919> does<00:04:21.580> I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
variation of the bulldog which does I

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.280 
variation of the bulldog which does I
think<00:04:22.060> increased<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.600> range<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.930> little<00:04:23.140> bit

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
think increased the range a little bit

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.130 
think increased the range a little bit
it<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.919> more<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.910> medium<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.780> long<00:04:25.930> range

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
it is more of a medium to long range

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.750 
it is more of a medium to long range
shotgun<00:04:26.650> that's<00:04:26.770> what<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:26.980> love<00:04:27.250> about<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.669> it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
shotgun that's what I love about it it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.510 
shotgun that's what I love about it it
reminds<00:04:28.300> me<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.570> striker<00:04:29.250> which<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.370> on

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
reminds me the striker which is on

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.310 
reminds me the striker which is on
another<00:04:31.120> legendary<00:04:31.510> shotgun<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.020> think<00:04:32.200> that

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
another legendary shotgun I think that

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.159 
another legendary shotgun I think that
one's<00:04:32.470> manufactured<00:04:33.250> by<00:04:33.340> Jacobs<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:35.020> was

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
one's manufactured by Jacobs it was

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:35.999 
one's manufactured by Jacobs it was
really<00:04:35.470> similar

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
really similar

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.159 
really similar
this<00:04:36.249> is<00:04:36.430> semi-auto<00:04:37.059> instead<00:04:37.449> of<00:04:37.569> pump-action

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
this is semi-auto instead of pump-action

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.200 
this is semi-auto instead of pump-action
that's<00:04:38.949> kind<00:04:39.339> of<00:04:39.369> a<00:04:39.460> big<00:04:39.639> difference<00:04:39.789> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
that's kind of a big difference the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.969 
that's kind of a big difference the
striker<00:04:40.509> has<00:04:40.719> like<00:04:40.900> slow<00:04:41.199> fired<00:04:41.499> this<00:04:41.770> has

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
striker has like slow fired this has

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.489 
striker has like slow fired this has
pretty<00:04:42.819> decent<00:04:42.909> fire<00:04:43.689> rate<00:04:43.869> like<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.110> said<00:04:44.289> it

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:44.499 
pretty decent fire rate like I said it

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.230 
pretty decent fire rate like I said it
just<00:04:44.559> has<00:04:44.830> really<00:04:45.039> good<00:04:45.279> stats<00:04:45.729> across<00:04:46.059> the
