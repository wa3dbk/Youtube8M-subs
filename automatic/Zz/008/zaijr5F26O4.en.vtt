00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and so hello everyone with you sanchez and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.020
 today we will transform 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.380
 resident of the zombie resident and this video I 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.450
 rented for those who decided to build my 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.080
 trap 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:20.250
 link to the trap in the lower left 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.570
 screen or something so to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.320
 tame zombies 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.349
 that is, the children of the zombie resident a resident of us 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:38.120
 will need potions of weakness explosive and 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:46.070
 bullseye also zombie artel 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:49.430
 put the night and will try to create 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.430
 zombie residents 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.210
 so I probably just find him better or 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.330
 still created 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.960
 and even better see if fed 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:13.780
 chit then get a zombie mode i just 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.750
 haven't tried them yet 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.590
 we will mock the poor people 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.350
 try to do normal 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 zombie resident is very likely 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:34.210
 that is not here so here we have integers 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.460
 2 zombie resident and take 1 and surrounded him 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:46.830
 any ears smacked you wanted 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:50.060
 is it a block like this? 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:55.070
 if you do it in survival then 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 you just need fudge 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.630
 through which you pass take away 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.700
 lego goes behind you and you close this 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:10.670
 a room to come or me one way out 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:13.230
 or something like that now turn on the day 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.520
 it's just that there was no one around 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:24.090
 so that no one interferes and throw in the zombies 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:27.450
 the inhabitant of the potion of weakness is so weak and the root 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.350
 and feed his mustached god all now 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.580
 about the kitchen here are pink 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:40.560
 spirals or something we have to wait 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.010
 a time that is about 3 minutes, I 34 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.780
 but still the effect speaks for itself 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.930
 everything works fine 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.430
 the main thing of course is a few debts 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:01.890
 Again, I repeat the process is very very 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.510
 Valuable Grace deviators that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.180
 the reason that light passes through the glass 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.050
 the light hits the zombie the zombie starts 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.880
 to burn 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.640
 over time dies understand so know 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.920
 if I put a pause and then the tooth 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.650
 when this zombie resident 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.650
 will become residents or not necessary after all I 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.440
 pause and so I survived 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.730
 some time 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.959
 a minute can be a half and a half 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:40.700
 still capture the moment of transformation 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.700
 zombies and residents when residents 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.959
 takes 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:53.379
 and repeat for a while and you can 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.610
 hold for example striking the creeper up 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.819
 turn to our zombie resident 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.349
 and look at it to speed up the process 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:07.790
 yeah well, although it won't speed up the process 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.060
 but still looking at him looking at 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.060
 him 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:18.500
 yara too early and start this video 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.540
 resume that is pauses took off but everything 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.120
 for the fact that you will see that zombie resident 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.200
 isic here really turned into 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.940
 resident and that I'm not tired of anyone yes then 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.190
 there is what I didn't get there I didn't kill him and 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.050
 delivered to the residents just 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.460
 most so names and would have thought if 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.250
 would i just resume from the moment he 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.600
 became a resident ask too much talk 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.860
 but still let's wait a bit 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.139
 watch him run so no one 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.770
 not because it put a pause killed him and 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.900
 then a regular resident appeared 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.900
 in short, just look 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:18.120
 Creeper 2 beat you or something else again 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.520
 one more time one more time one more time 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.590
 one more time 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:27.599
 die die die die die die 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.340
 die die die die 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:35.340
 e.i. Russians have our tag and you watch 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.249
 like usually already strongly or part about 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.729
 Zombies are not all already an ordinary resident 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:44.189
 I didn't take a picture of him. I'm sorry, but still 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:48.120
 appeared ordinary resident can trade 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:54.360
 can also put it your trap 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:56.009
 that is, such a trance is once around 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.789
 put the walls and everything 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.379
 and get a resident who grandmother then 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.529
 have that bait 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:10.939
 but on this we end with you 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:10.939
 There was Sanchez and a resident of luck schemes for everyone
