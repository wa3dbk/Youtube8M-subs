00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.320
 let's prepare a salad with bonito 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.820
 cool 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.450
 and these are the ingredients that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.450
 we need 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.250
 the drain well and let some leaves 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.970
 Let's put them together and cut them into 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 strips first in a sense 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.430
 and then in the other 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.090
 We spread the lettuce over the source in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.130
 which we are going to serve 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.650
 we cut half red pepper here 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.930
 we remove the whitened part we can 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.730
 scratch it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.730
 or also cut it into thin tacos 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.640
 and now we share it with the lettuce 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.470
 we remove the front of the middle 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.150
 zucchini and we peel it 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.490
 then we cut it into discs 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.260
 thin 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.260
 we put them around the edge 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.059
 we wait for the matte world and cut it in 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.059
 discs 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 we do the same with the other good this 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.979
 we are not going to remove the skin 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.070
 and now like cucumber what 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.560
 We distribute by the source for the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.930
 asparagus 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.369
 we drain them well and place them 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.119
 way that they leave from the center towards 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.310
 the large edges of a bike wheel 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.020
 when we go to serve the salad the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.259
 right we go with a jet of oil of 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.259
 olive 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.009
 We distribute the juice of half a lemon 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.439
 and finally we deliver the nice fresh 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.539
 We've known the pretty one for about 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.840
 10 minutes and we've let it cool 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.820
 you can use a nice mail tuna what 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310
 that you have more on hand we are going 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.290
 dividing between the asparagus 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.100
 and we have our salad ready to 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.030
 enjoy a healthy easy quick salad 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.030
