in<00:00:06.550> this<00:00:06.700> video<00:00:07.000> I<00:00:07.060> wanted<00:00:07.330> to<00:00:07.420> give<00:00:07.540> you<00:00:07.569> a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
in this video I wanted to give you a

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.940 
in this video I wanted to give you a
little<00:00:08.080> bit<00:00:08.170> of<00:00:08.200> food<00:00:08.350> for<00:00:08.410> thought<00:00:08.620> of

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
little bit of food for thought of

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.310 
little bit of food for thought of
improvising<00:00:09.730> on<00:00:09.940> the<00:00:10.090> fish<00:00:10.330> song<00:00:10.600> bathtub

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
improvising on the fish song bathtub

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.770 
improvising on the fish song bathtub
Jing<00:00:11.530> as<00:00:12.100> fish<00:00:12.370> songs<00:00:12.580> go<00:00:12.850> this<00:00:13.240> one's<00:00:13.450> pretty

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
Jing as fish songs go this one's pretty

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.959 
Jing as fish songs go this one's pretty
easy<00:00:13.900> very<00:00:14.709> easy<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.100> improvise<00:00:15.490> on<00:00:15.549> because

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
easy very easy to improvise on because

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.390 
easy very easy to improvise on because
it's<00:00:16.090> really<00:00:16.270> just<00:00:16.660> pure<00:00:17.289> C<00:00:17.619> mixolydian<00:00:17.830> it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
it's really just pure C mixolydian it

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's really just pure C mixolydian it
doesn't<00:00:18.670> really<00:00:18.820> have<00:00:19.119> chord<00:00:19.420> changes<00:00:19.840> or

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
doesn't really have chord changes or

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.470 
doesn't really have chord changes or
anything<00:00:20.199> -<00:00:20.410> it<00:00:21.130> is<00:00:21.310> it's<00:00:21.610> loosely<00:00:22.060> based<00:00:22.240> on

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
anything - it is it's loosely based on

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.580 
anything - it is it's loosely based on
the<00:00:22.630> chord<00:00:22.840> progression<00:00:23.260> that's<00:00:23.380> at<00:00:23.500> the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
the chord progression that's at the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.110 
the chord progression that's at the
beginning<00:00:23.920> of<00:00:24.010> the<00:00:24.070> song<00:00:24.370> which<00:00:24.550> is<00:00:24.580> just<00:00:24.940> back

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
beginning of the song which is just back

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.490 
beginning of the song which is just back
and<00:00:25.300> forth<00:00:25.570> from<00:00:25.810> C<00:00:26.170> G<00:00:26.590> minor<00:00:31.020> and<00:00:32.020> that<00:00:32.050> chord

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
and forth from C G minor and that chord

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.959 
and forth from C G minor and that chord
progression<00:00:32.529> would<00:00:33.039> certainly<00:00:33.399> lend<00:00:33.670> itself

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
progression would certainly lend itself

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.930 
progression would certainly lend itself
well<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.629> C<00:00:34.870> mixolydian<00:00:35.079> mode<00:00:35.590> but<00:00:36.520> really

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
well to the C mixolydian mode but really

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.610 
well to the C mixolydian mode but really
when<00:00:37.120> they<00:00:37.239> get<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.809> jam<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.409> song

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
when they get to the jam of the song

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.079 
when they get to the jam of the song
they<00:00:38.769> get<00:00:38.890> away<00:00:39.070> from<00:00:39.129> that<00:00:39.339> G<00:00:39.579> minor<00:00:39.820> chord

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
they get away from that G minor chord

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.790 
they get away from that G minor chord
pretty<00:00:40.300> quickly<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.960> are<00:00:41.079> really<00:00:41.409> just<00:00:41.620> out

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
pretty quickly and are really just out

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.590 
pretty quickly and are really just out
there<00:00:42.010> in<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.190> world<00:00:42.339> of<00:00:42.489> C<00:00:42.730> mixolydian<00:00:42.940> and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
there in the world of C mixolydian and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.430 
there in the world of C mixolydian and
it's<00:00:43.809> wide<00:00:44.019> open

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
it's wide open

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's wide open
one<00:00:44.859> of<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.010> characteristics<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.539> sound

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
one of the characteristics of the sound

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.049 
one of the characteristics of the sound
of<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.170> mixolydian<00:00:47.499> mode<00:00:47.829> I<00:00:48.339> think<00:00:48.699> of<00:00:48.819> it<00:00:48.909> is

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
of the mixolydian mode I think of it is

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.540 
of the mixolydian mode I think of it is
the<00:00:49.690> well<00:00:50.050> certainly<00:00:50.679> the<00:00:50.859> heavily<00:00:51.159> heavy

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
the well certainly the heavily heavy

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.369 
the well certainly the heavily heavy
presence<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:52.179> the<00:00:52.269> flatted<00:00:52.749> seventh<00:00:53.199> which

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
presence of the flatted seventh which

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.380 
presence of the flatted seventh which
you<00:00:53.589> know<00:00:53.739> in<00:00:53.829> this<00:00:53.920> case<00:00:54.190> we're<00:00:54.999> in<00:00:55.089> there<00:00:55.179> you

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
you know in this case we're in there you

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.879 
you know in this case we're in there you
see<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.559> flatted<00:00:56.949> 7th<00:00:57.339> it'd<00:00:57.429> be<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:57.609> b-flat<00:00:58.030> and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
see the flatted 7th it'd be a b-flat and

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.099 
see the flatted 7th it'd be a b-flat and
to<00:00:59.889> expand<00:01:00.339> on<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.699> then<00:01:00.940> also<00:01:01.149> there's<00:01:01.870> kind

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
to expand on that then also there's kind

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.590 
to expand on that then also there's kind
of<00:01:02.170> adjusted<00:01:02.710> position<00:01:03.339> of<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.969> sound<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.510> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
of adjusted position of the sound of the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.310 
of adjusted position of the sound of the
C<00:01:04.839> chord<00:01:05.520> versus<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.880> sound<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.390> b-flat<00:01:07.840> or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
C chord versus the sound of a b-flat or

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.350 
C chord versus the sound of a b-flat or
all<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.190> notes<00:01:09.370> of<00:01:09.520> both<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.850> those<00:01:09.970> chords

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
all of the notes of both of those chords

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.720 
all of the notes of both of those chords
are<00:01:10.480> present<00:01:10.930> in<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.170> mixolydian<00:01:11.590> mode<00:01:11.830> so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
are present in the mixolydian mode so

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.520 
are present in the mixolydian mode so
you<00:01:12.760> can<00:01:13.060> really<00:01:13.210> play<00:01:13.330> off<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:14.080> presence

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
you can really play off of the presence

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.920 
you can really play off of the presence
of<00:01:14.650> those<00:01:14.770> two<00:01:15.010> chords<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.730> get<00:01:16.510> some<00:01:16.690> really

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
of those two chords to get some really

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.560 
of those two chords to get some really
interesting<00:01:17.170> ideas<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.730> what<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.090> like<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.420> do

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
interesting ideas so what I like to do

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.870 
interesting ideas so what I like to do
once<00:01:19.840> again<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.380> using<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.890> Caged<00:01:21.130> system<00:01:21.370> I

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
once again is using the Caged system I

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.400 
once again is using the Caged system I
like<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.180> break<00:01:22.390> down<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.750> neck<00:01:22.930> into<00:01:23.140> some

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
like to break down the neck into some

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.430 
like to break down the neck into some
different<00:01:23.740> zones<00:01:23.980> that<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.400> can<00:01:24.580> work<00:01:24.760> with<00:01:24.820> and

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
different zones that I can work with and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.870 
different zones that I can work with and
what<00:01:26.440> I'm<00:01:26.560> looking<00:01:26.860> for<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.160> particular<00:01:27.280> is

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
what I'm looking for in particular is

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.970 
what I'm looking for in particular is
where<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.120> can<00:01:28.360> have<00:01:28.540> this<00:01:28.810> b-flat<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.740> C

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
where I can have this b-flat and the C

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.770 
where I can have this b-flat and the C
chord<00:01:30.280> right<00:01:30.490> next<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.880> each<00:01:30.970> other<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.690> of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
chord right next to each other and of

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.940 
chord right next to each other and of
course<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.080> mean<00:01:32.200> they're<00:01:32.290> always<00:01:32.440> just<00:01:32.770> two

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
course I mean they're always just two

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.710 
course I mean they're always just two
frets<00:01:33.220> from<00:01:33.460> each<00:01:33.550> other<00:01:33.790> but<00:01:34.090> using<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.540> cave

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
frets from each other but using the cave

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.120 
frets from each other but using the cave
system<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.290> don't<00:01:35.440> even<00:01:35.560> have<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.830> move<00:01:35.950> that

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
system you don't even have to move that

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.640 
system you don't even have to move that
far<00:01:36.400> you<00:01:36.550> can<00:01:36.730> find<00:01:37.030> both<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.630> those<00:01:38.230> chords

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
far you can find both of those chords

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.100 
far you can find both of those chords
chances<00:01:39.100> are<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.400> one<00:01:39.580> single<00:01:39.940> position<00:01:40.240> so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
chances are in one single position so

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.380 
chances are in one single position so
for<00:01:41.260> example<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:42.040> C<00:01:42.280> chord<00:01:42.640> right<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.270> in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
for example the C chord right here in

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
for example the C chord right here in
the<00:01:43.480> third<00:01:43.750> third<00:01:44.740> position<00:01:45.250> Caged<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.420> shape

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
the third third position Caged a shape

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.830 
the third third position Caged a shape
and<00:01:47.740> then<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.370> B<00:01:48.610> flat<00:01:48.820> chord<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.480> that<00:01:49.510> same

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
and then the B flat chord and that same

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.230 
and then the B flat chord and that same
exact<00:01:50.140> position<00:01:50.290> would<00:01:50.710> be<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.920> cage

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
exact position would be the cage

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
exact position would be the cage
shame

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.010 

you<00:01:57.430> can<00:01:57.580> move<00:01:57.700> up<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.000> fifth<00:01:58.270> position<00:01:58.450> where

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
you can move up to fifth position where

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.790 
you can move up to fifth position where
your<00:01:59.290> C<00:01:59.710> chord<00:02:00.070> is<00:02:00.400> not<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> cage<00:02:01.510> G<00:02:01.990> shape<00:02:02.290> and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
your C chord is not a cage G shape and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.740 
your C chord is not a cage G shape and
your<00:02:03.100> B<00:02:03.250> flat<00:02:03.280> chord<00:02:03.580> is<00:02:04.030> right<00:02:04.240> here<00:02:04.480> in<00:02:04.660> the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
your B flat chord is right here in the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.470 
your B flat chord is right here in the
sixth<00:02:05.110> position<00:02:05.260> actually<00:02:06.070> with<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> Caged<00:02:07.150> a

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
sixth position actually with the Caged a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.270 
sixth position actually with the Caged a
shape

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.990 

and<00:02:12.380> certainly<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.620> your<00:02:14.190> cage<00:02:14.490> or<00:02:14.820> your

on the cage 2e this is kind of where you
play<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.740> melody<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.340> songs<00:02:20.550> where<00:02:20.820> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

play the melody this one to anyway

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.020 
play the melody this one to anyway
and<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.450> B<00:02:24.600> flat<00:02:24.900> chord<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.350> Caged<00:02:26.030> D

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and the B flat chord is the Caged D

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
and the B flat chord is the Caged D
shape<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.630> position

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.460 

and<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.150> even<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.810> again<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.260> in

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and you can even do it again up here in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.310 
and you can even do it again up here in
the<00:02:34.560> 12th<00:02:34.860> position<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.490> caged<00:02:35.880> C<00:02:36.330> shape<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
the 12th position the caged C shape to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.790 
the 12th position the caged C shape to
make<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> C<00:02:37.800> chord<00:02:38.070> engaged<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.510> shape<00:02:40.110> off<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
make a C chord engaged a shape off the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.220 
make a C chord engaged a shape off the
13th<00:02:41.280> fret<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.820> make<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.060> B<00:02:42.180> flat<00:02:42.450> chord

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.840 

so<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.530> think<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.950> notes<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.580> C

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
so if you think of the notes of the C

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.730 
so if you think of the notes of the C
chord<00:02:50.180> as<00:02:50.480> your<00:02:50.660> home<00:02:50.930> notes<00:02:51.260> your<00:02:51.500> kind<00:02:51.650> of

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
chord as your home notes your kind of

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.490 
chord as your home notes your kind of
main<00:02:52.010> target<00:02:52.610> notes<00:02:52.930> then<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.020> can<00:02:54.170> think<00:02:54.410> of

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
main target notes then you can think of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.220 
main target notes then you can think of
the<00:02:54.710> B<00:02:55.130> flat<00:02:55.460> chord<00:02:55.490> as<00:02:56.030> kind<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.570> away<00:02:57.200> from

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the B flat chord as kind of away from

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.860 
the B flat chord as kind of away from
home<00:02:57.650> right<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.250> can<00:02:58.490> use<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.330> B<00:02:59.540> flat

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
home right so you can use the B flat

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.380 
home right so you can use the B flat
chord<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.500> build<00:03:00.830> up<00:03:01.220> melodies<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.030> build<00:03:02.210> up

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
chord to build up melodies and build up

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.600 
chord to build up melodies and build up
a<00:03:02.510> little<00:03:02.660> bit<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.990> tension<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.650> then<00:03:04.520> you

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
a little bit of tension and then you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.790 
a little bit of tension and then you
resolve<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.300> tension<00:03:05.600> by<00:03:06.200> targeting<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
resolve that tension by targeting the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.040 
resolve that tension by targeting the
notes<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.250> C<00:03:07.460> chord<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:08.630> other<00:03:08.810> thing

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
notes of the C chord one other thing

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.300 
notes of the C chord one other thing
I'll<00:03:09.170> add<00:03:09.320> real<00:03:09.500> quick<00:03:09.740> is<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.100> if<00:03:10.190> you're

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
I'll add real quick is that if you're

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.280 
I'll add real quick is that if you're
ever<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.580> little<00:03:11.330> bit<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.600> loss<00:03:11.810> as<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.050> what

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
ever a little bit of a loss as to what

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.480 
ever a little bit of a loss as to what
to<00:03:12.410> play<00:03:12.620> when<00:03:12.830> you're<00:03:12.950> improvising<00:03:13.100> which

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.890 
to play when you're improvising which
can<00:03:13.670> definitely<00:03:13.760> happen<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.510> song<00:03:14.720> with

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
can definitely happen in a song with

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.690 
can definitely happen in a song with
this<00:03:15.050> word<00:03:15.260> you're<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:15.920> wide<00:03:16.130> open<00:03:16.580> and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
it's just a big C chord you don't have

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.410 
it's just a big C chord you don't have
too<00:03:19.160> much<00:03:19.280> direction<00:03:19.850> if<00:03:19.970> you're<00:03:20.090> not<00:03:20.240> careful

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
too much direction if you're not careful

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.810 
too much direction if you're not careful
one<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.560> things<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:21.950> always<00:03:22.370> do<00:03:22.610> is

and<00:03:49.930> if<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.170> want<00:03:50.349> to<00:03:50.409> improvise<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:51.129> on<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.489> I

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
and if I want to improvise the on that I

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.580 
and if I want to improvise the on that I
might<00:03:51.939> just<00:03:52.239> say<00:03:52.599> for<00:03:52.810> example<00:03:53.170> take<00:03:53.319> a<00:03:53.349> little

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
might just say for example take a little

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.470 
might just say for example take a little
piece<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.010> melody<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.760> stretch<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.390> out

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
piece of that melody and stretch it out

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.259 
piece of that melody and stretch it out
a<00:03:55.540> little<00:03:55.689> bit<00:03:55.870> repeated<00:03:56.349> a<00:03:56.439> few<00:03:56.470> times<00:03:56.620> or<00:03:57.269> I

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
a little bit repeated a few times or I

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.720 
a little bit repeated a few times or I
might<00:03:58.569> play<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.079> part<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> melody<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.129> then

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
might play a part of the melody and then

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.149 
might play a part of the melody and then
skip<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.659> then<00:04:01.689> improvise<00:04:02.170> from<00:04:02.620> there<00:04:02.829> or<00:04:03.129> I

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
skip and then improvise from there or I

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.630 
skip and then improvise from there or I
might<00:04:04.560> improvise<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.739> line<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.459> then

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
might improvise the line that then

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.910 
might improvise the line that then
resolves<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.629> be<00:04:07.720> good<00:04:07.989> turns<00:04:08.319> into<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.650> part

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
resolves and be good turns into a part

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.440 
resolves and be good turns into a part
of<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.069> melody<00:04:09.370> I'll<00:04:09.909> show<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> kind<00:04:10.329> of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
of the melody I'll show you the kind of

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:29.670 
of the melody I'll show you the kind of
thing<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.690> mean<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.200> might<00:04:11.379> go<00:04:28.620> stumbled<00:04:29.620> a

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
thing I mean like I might go stumbled a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.810 
thing I mean like I might go stumbled a
little<00:04:29.710> bit<00:04:30.010> at<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.160> end<00:04:30.250> there<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.669> get

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
little bit at the end there but you get

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.159 
little bit at the end there but you get
the<00:04:30.940> idea<00:04:31.210> now<00:04:31.419> I'm<00:04:31.810> going<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.990> try<00:04:32.139> to

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
the idea now I'm going to try to

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.409 
the idea now I'm going to try to
improvise<00:04:32.650> an<00:04:32.830> actual<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.310> here<00:04:33.580> let's<00:04:33.880> see

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
improvise an actual so here let's see

00:04:34.419 --> 00:05:51.390 
improvise an actual so here let's see
what<00:04:34.539> happens

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.460
