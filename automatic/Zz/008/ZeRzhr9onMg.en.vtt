of the candle and it works great you
don't<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> worry<00:00:52.500> about<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.980> lid

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
don't have to worry about the lid

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
don't have to worry about the lid
falling<00:00:53.879> off<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.360> being<00:00:54.629> uneven<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.320> anything

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
falling off or being uneven or anything

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.900 
falling off or being uneven or anything
and<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.760> works<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.390> great<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.050> sometimes

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
and it works really great so sometimes

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.939 
and it works really great so sometimes
non-traditional<00:00:59.910> ways<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.390> doing<00:01:00.510> things

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
non-traditional ways of doing things

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.789 
non-traditional ways of doing things
really<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> better<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.210> now

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
really is a better way now

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.170 
really is a better way now
well<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> reason<00:01:05.489> why<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.640> tell<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
well and the reason why I tell you this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
well and the reason why I tell you this
is<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> traditional<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
is because the traditional way of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.280 
is because the traditional way of
getting<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> mortgage<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
getting a mortgage is you have to have a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.080 
getting a mortgage is you have to have a
down<00:01:10.500> payment

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
down payment

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.429 
down payment
well<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.210> simply<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.780> always<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> case

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
well not simply not always the case

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
well not simply not always the case
there<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.040> many<00:01:14.430> many<00:01:14.790> different<00:01:14.880> options<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
there are many many different options of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.210 
there are many many different options of
getting<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> house<00:01:16.890> without<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.240> payment

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
getting the house without a down payment

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
getting the house without a down payment
there<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.610> great<00:01:21.090> ways<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> them

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
there are really great ways some of them

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.130 
there are really great ways some of them
require<00:01:22.259> no<00:01:22.619> mortgage<00:01:23.040> insurance<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:25.049> you
