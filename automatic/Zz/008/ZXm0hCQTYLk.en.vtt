00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.160
 I grabbed them 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.830

 which the books have shown 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.670

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.509
 Viewpoint not that the minister are provided also and certainly yes 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:59.829

 too high 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.819
 No, they were actually

 could fit together 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.329
 if they have seen it all here 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.729
 they will say 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.639
 that is obvious 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.109
 that's a one-singspiel 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.959
 it is a colorful evening 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.979
 there is one in the other 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.519
 that's not honest and spooled 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.669
 the 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.619
 can actually be 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.389

 Plettenberg 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.489
 like city hall with 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:14.659

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.370
 divorced read 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.080
 and spelled the job written down this is he mean but also extremely 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.710
 controversial German constitutional lawyer and political philosopher Karl Schmidt 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.890
 who was born in Plettenberg and there 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.340
 at the end then again he was laid 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.009
 he was not entirely uncontroversial one can say 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.819
 he was 7 what one hears the most important lawyer between the first 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.160
 and World War II but then he is like so many levels 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.599
 Thuringia 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.669
 Como in these haunted spades would also find militias 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.689
 one does not know 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.849
 So there you know it but you have to inform them and 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:04.439
 Prices 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.529
 May he too is different than he thought so far so the question of which 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.759
 completely different and he has to say monitored 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.479
 the younger ones 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.719
 if the band 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.210
 and you also have somehow changed Brecht somehow afterwards 

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:22.409
 after one chapter was completed and another 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.469

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.129

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.930
 but 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.860
 the quiz 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.389
 we already have 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.889
 and misery under fax number melodrama they do not write us for it 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.629
