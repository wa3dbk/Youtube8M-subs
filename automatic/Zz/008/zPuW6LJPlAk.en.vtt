know<00:01:59.670> less<00:01:59.939> than<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.180> minute<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.290> we'll

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
know less than a minute and then we'll

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.609 
know less than a minute and then we'll
restart<00:02:01.610> we<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> disc<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> working<00:02:03.899> been

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
restart we know the disc is working been

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.080 
restart we know the disc is working been
there<00:02:04.829> done<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.100> yeah<00:02:05.939> ah<00:02:07.910> won't<00:02:08.910> take<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
there done that yeah ah won't take a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.960 
there done that yeah ah won't take a
minute<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.539> two<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.520> will<00:02:11.520> reboot<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
minute or two and then will reboot and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.460 
minute or two and then will reboot and
we'll<00:02:12.330> try<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.599> mount<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.930> disk<00:02:13.110> image<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we'll try to mount that disk image and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.730 
we'll try to mount that disk image and
see<00:02:13.530> what

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
see what

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.260 
see what
there<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:16.700> guess<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.850> could<00:02:18.000> call<00:02:18.120> this

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
there I guess we could call this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.060 
there I guess we could call this
debugging<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.990> installation<00:02:19.620> or<00:02:19.770> whatever

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
debugging the installation or whatever

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.430 
debugging the installation or whatever
actually<00:02:20.520> no<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.960> still<00:02:22.140> set

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
actually no you have to still set

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.890 
actually no you have to still set
startup<00:02:22.950> disk<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.490> before<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.150> just

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
startup disk here before you just

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660 
startup disk here before you just
automatic<00:02:25.440> no<00:02:25.560> that's<00:02:25.980> done<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.610> do

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
automatic no that's done I just I do

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.700 
automatic no that's done I just I do
have<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.030> choose<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.900> disk<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.470> quote

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
have to choose the disk that I quote

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.770 
have to choose the disk that I quote
unquote<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> install<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
unquote want to install on but then the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.630 
unquote want to install on but then the
first<00:02:31.020> thing<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.260> do<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.440> say<00:02:31.740> don't<00:02:32.310> install

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
first thing I do is say don't install

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.430 
first thing I do is say don't install
the<00:02:32.820> whole<00:02:32.940> system<00:02:33.180> take<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.720> away<00:02:33.870> right

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the whole system take that away right

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.380 
the whole system take that away right
okay<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> doesn't<00:02:35.550> automatically<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
okay so it doesn't automatically the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.510 
okay so it doesn't automatically the
system<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:36.870> yeah<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.800> doesn't<00:02:38.070> take<00:02:38.190> 20

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
system now yeah so it doesn't take 20

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.830 
system now yeah so it doesn't take 20
minutes<00:02:38.550> there's<00:02:38.940> no<00:02:39.060> point<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.450> putting<00:02:39.600> all

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
minutes there's no point in putting all

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720 
minutes there's no point in putting all
the<00:02:39.960> files<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.410> work<00:02:40.650> back<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.400> they're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the files that work back on it they're

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.090 
the files that work back on it they're
always<00:02:41.880> getting<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.470> normally<00:02:43.860> do

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
always getting at is if you normally do

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.410 
always getting at is if you normally do
a<00:02:44.300> mac<00:02:45.300> OS<00:02:45.600> install<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:47.520> gotta<00:02:47.730> select

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
a mac OS install you gotta select

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.510 
a mac OS install you gotta select
startup<00:02:48.870> disk<00:02:49.140> before<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.800> put<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
startup disk before you put the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.810 
startup disk before you put the
installer<00:02:50.880> oh<00:02:51.120> yeah<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.710> then<00:02:52.710> restart<00:02:53.310> just

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
installer oh yeah and then restart just

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.400 
installer oh yeah and then restart just

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.490 
affect the yeah yeah the disk hard drive
yeah<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.370> did<00:02:59.790> choose<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.300> destination<00:03:00.540> yeah

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
yeah I did choose the destination yeah

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.250 
yeah I did choose the destination yeah
to<00:03:01.830> apply<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.340> new<00:03:02.670> software<00:03:02.910> package<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.570> but

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to apply the new software package it but

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.190 
to apply the new software package it but
other<00:03:04.470> than<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:06.480> we're<00:03:06.720> not<00:03:06.750> we're

other than that because we're not we're

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.660 
other than that because we're not we're
not<00:03:07.230> installing<00:03:07.800> from<00:03:07.950> scratch<00:03:08.220> i'm<00:03:08.490> just

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
not installing from scratch i'm just

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.250 
not installing from scratch i'm just
putting<00:03:08.790> patches<00:03:09.270> on<00:03:09.390> right<00:03:09.720> which<00:03:10.050> you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
putting patches on right which you

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.560 
putting patches on right which you
wouldn't<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.280> under<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> non<00:03:11.970> modified

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
wouldn't do under a non modified

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.930 
wouldn't do under a non modified
installer<00:03:13.050> right<00:03:13.320> yeah<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.490> installers

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
installer right yeah so the installers

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.690 
installer right yeah so the installers
all<00:03:15.150> butchered<00:03:15.570> up<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.900> yeah<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.310> we'll<00:03:17.520> see

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
all butchered up to yeah so we'll see

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.660 
all butchered up to yeah so we'll see
where<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.030> approach<00:03:18.210> of<00:03:18.240> goes<00:03:19.670> shooting

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
where the approach of goes shooting

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.730 
where the approach of goes shooting
through<00:03:21.030> one<00:03:21.270> issue<00:03:21.720> after<00:03:22.170> another<00:03:22.350> let's

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
through one issue after another let's

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.760 
through one issue after another let's
see<00:03:22.890> if<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.040> fires<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:24.110> looks<00:03:25.110> promising<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
see if it fires up looks promising so

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.790 
see if it fires up looks promising so
far

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.290 

yeah<00:03:30.800> so<00:03:31.099> ultimately<00:03:31.400> depending<00:03:32.090> on<00:03:32.209> what

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
yeah so ultimately depending on what

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.750 
yeah so ultimately depending on what
happens<00:03:32.330> how<00:03:32.930> how<00:03:33.560> much<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.069> system<00:03:34.520> i<00:03:34.610> can

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
happens how how much of the system i can

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.190 
happens how how much of the system i can
make<00:03:34.910> function<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.900> know<00:03:36.020> what<00:03:36.110> this

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
make function you know what this

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.839 
make function you know what this
brightly<00:03:36.530> indicates<00:03:38.110> market<00:03:39.110> share<00:03:39.349> is<00:03:39.849> this

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
brightly indicates market share is this

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.390 
brightly indicates market share is this
is<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:42.319> machine<00:03:42.709> taking<00:03:43.069> a<00:03:43.160> chunk

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
clunk it on ok so we've got a 32-bit

story<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.960> tell<00:05:03.139> based<00:05:03.350> mac<00:05:03.680> let's<00:05:04.010> try<00:05:04.220> again

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
story to tell based mac let's try again

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.920 
story to tell based mac let's try again
to<00:05:05.419> realism<00:05:05.990> yeah<00:05:06.800> its<00:05:06.950> realism<00:05:10.930> coming

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
to realism yeah its realism coming

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.260 
to realism yeah its realism coming
coming<00:05:12.139> in<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.470> six<00:05:13.039> hours<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.310> tickles<00:05:13.940> what

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
coming in it six hours of tickles what

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.230 
coming in it six hours of tickles what
the<00:05:14.389> hell<00:05:14.539> is<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:14.690> yeah<00:05:15.560> coming<00:05:16.190> in<00:05:16.280> at<00:05:16.370> 650<00:05:17.090> k

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
the hell is that yeah coming in at 650 k

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.740 
the hell is that yeah coming in at 650 k
per<00:05:17.419> second<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.970> that's<00:05:19.970> probably<00:05:20.270> as<00:05:20.450> quick

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
per second so that's probably as quick

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.930 
per second so that's probably as quick
as<00:05:20.870> we<00:05:20.930> can<00:05:21.050> get<00:05:21.169> into<00:05:21.410> sourceforge<00:05:21.950> they're

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
as we can get into sourceforge they're

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.279 
as we can get into sourceforge they're
probably<00:05:23.120> could<00:05:23.389> max<00:05:23.630> out<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.990> internet

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
probably could max out the internet

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.350 
probably could max out the internet
connection<00:05:24.650> like<00:05:24.889> 800<00:05:25.639> or<00:05:25.760> whatever<00:05:25.970> it's<00:05:26.210> all

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
connection like 800 or whatever it's all

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.270 
connection like 800 or whatever it's all
I<00:05:26.600> would<00:05:27.020> say<00:05:27.050> its<00:05:27.320> operating<00:05:27.919> as<00:05:28.039> quickly

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
I would say its operating as quickly

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.890 
I would say its operating as quickly
there<00:05:28.639> on<00:05:28.850> that<00:05:29.000> side<00:05:29.210> is<00:05:29.450> everything<00:05:29.750> else

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
there on that side is everything else

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.050 
there on that side is everything else
