 creature with nine years of safety 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.790
 as he has shown us I think that what 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.600
 that we are seeing today in this program 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.880
 is that Mexico was already dancing because 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.070

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.280

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.610
 strength personality and especially the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.610

 Diego is the rhythm in your blood not 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.440

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.980

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.790
