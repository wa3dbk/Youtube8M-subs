tutorials<00:00:03.540> today<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:03.899> looking<00:00:04.080> at<00:00:04.290> vectors

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
tutorials today we're looking at vectors

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.610 
tutorials today we're looking at vectors
and<00:00:04.950> velocities<00:00:05.580> so<00:00:05.609> what<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> vector<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and velocities so what is a vector in a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.089 
and velocities so what is a vector in a
velocity<00:00:07.799> well<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:09.050> will<00:00:10.050> find<00:00:10.260> out<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.590> what

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
velocity well I will find out so what

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
velocity well I will find out so what
you<00:00:11.160> want<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.820> want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> make<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.540> on

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
you want to do is you want to make a on

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.090 
you want to do is you want to make a on
command<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.680> control<00:00:16.680> space<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
command so like this so control space to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.240 
command so like this so control space to
bring<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.830> basically<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
bring that up and basically what I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.550 
bring that up and basically what I
predict<00:00:20.670> your<00:00:20.880> velocity<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.900> um<00:00:22.020> it

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
predict your velocity is is it um it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
predict your velocity is is it um it
changes<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.250> sort<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.490> speed<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
changes this sort of speed that the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.240 
changes this sort of speed that the
players<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.050> at<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:25.980> gonna<00:00:26.070> make

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
players going at so we're gonna make

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.060 
players going at so we're gonna make
like<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> super<00:00:26.760> jump<00:00:26.970> plug<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.070> well

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like a super jump plug in and well

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.870 
like a super jump plug in and well
that's<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.460> gonna<00:00:29.580> shoot<00:00:29.820> them

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
that's gonna do is gonna shoot them

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.220 
that's gonna do is gonna shoot them
straight<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> air<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.810> obviously<00:00:31.080> it's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
straight in the air and obviously it's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.690 
straight in the air and obviously it's
very<00:00:31.439> easy<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> customize<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
very easy to customize you can do it

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.280 
very easy to customize you can do it
very<00:00:32.759> easily<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.360> I'll<00:00:33.870> show<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> do

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
very easily and I'll show you how to do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
very easily and I'll show you how to do
that<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.680> we're<00:00:35.280> gonna<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.610> fit<00:00:35.790> check<00:00:35.969> if

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that so we're gonna do is fit check if

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.380 
that so we're gonna do is fit check if
the<00:00:36.360> label<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> fillet<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.149> equals

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the label is so fillet with equals

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.729 
the label is so fillet with equals
ignore<00:00:39.600> case<00:00:39.690> test<00:00:40.079> cuz<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:40.649> why

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
ignore case test cuz I think that's why

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.400 
ignore case test cuz I think that's why
I've<00:00:40.860> set<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.160> too<00:00:41.450> we<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> UM<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.260> want

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
I've set it up too we want to UM we want

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600 
I've set it up too we want to UM we want
to<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.559> we'll<00:00:43.920> check<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> play<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
to get we'll check it to play as a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
to get we'll check it to play as a
sender<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.629> sends<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> player<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
sender or if your sends a player if the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.569 
sender or if your sends a player if the
sender<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:47.160> instance<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.899> player<00:00:49.579> then

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
sender is an instance of player then

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.729 
sender is an instance of player then
we're<00:00:50.670> gonna<00:00:50.820> say<00:00:50.969> player<00:00:51.360> player<00:00:52.050> equals

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
we're gonna say player player equals

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
we're gonna say player player equals
player<00:00:53.250> send<00:00:53.969> basic<00:00:55.760> tutorials<00:00:56.840> when<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> say

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
player send basic tutorials when I say

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.029 
player send basic tutorials when I say
player<00:00:58.320> dot<00:00:59.070> set<00:00:59.640> velocity<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
player dot set velocity and what this

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.149 
player dot set velocity and what this
does<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.870> we're<00:01:03.870> gonna<00:01:03.960> set<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.799> they

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
does is we're gonna set the way they

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.300 
does is we're gonna set the way they
move<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.729> we're<00:01:05.820> gonna<00:01:05.909> say<00:01:06.060> new<00:01:07.070> vector<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
move so we're gonna say new vector and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
move so we're gonna say new vector and
you<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.299> double<00:01:09.540> X<00:01:09.659> or

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you see here we have like double X or

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.880 
you see here we have like double X or
floats<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.909> stuff<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.840> let's<00:01:13.590> go

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
floats and it's and stuff so let's go

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.170 
floats and it's and stuff so let's go
for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.040> double<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.670> gonna<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.000> we

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
for the double one we're gonna do is we

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.980 
for the double one we're gonna do is we
want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.360> set<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> X<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.490> zero<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> or

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
want to set the X to zero like that or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
want to set the X to zero like that or
actually<00:01:19.500> no<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> set<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> X<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
actually no we want to set the X to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.340 
actually no we want to set the X to
whatever<00:01:20.909> X<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.390> were<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.780> before<00:01:21.900> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
whatever X they were going out before so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.030 
whatever X they were going out before so
you<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> say<00:01:22.680> player<00:01:23.090> dot<00:01:24.090> gets<00:01:25.040> vector

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you want to say player dot gets vector

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.950 
you want to say player dot gets vector
or<00:01:26.729> velocity<00:01:27.500> get<00:01:28.500> X<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.420> gonna<00:01:30.630> return

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
or velocity get X so that's gonna return

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.590 
or velocity get X so that's gonna return
the<00:01:31.350> X<00:01:31.770> velocity<00:01:32.100> they're<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:33.509> for

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the X velocity they're going out now for

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
the X velocity they're going out now for
y<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> shoot<00:01:34.470> them<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> air

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
y we want to shoot them up in the air

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.420 
y we want to shoot them up in the air
loads<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.689> 0.25<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> jumping

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
loads so I think not 0.25 is the jumping

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.030 
loads so I think not 0.25 is the jumping
one<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.290> loads<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.890> just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
one so if we want to go up loads we just

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
one so if we want to go up loads we just
set<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.520> eight<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.119> something<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
set this to like eight or something and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.660 
set this to like eight or something and
then<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.340> say<00:01:44.399> player

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
then if this one we just say player

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
then if this one we just say player
don't<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.509> velocity<00:01:47.210> don't<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> X<00:01:48.659> like

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
don't get velocity don't get the X like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.060 
don't get velocity don't get the X like
that<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> obviously<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.619> change<00:01:52.649> these

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that so obviously you can change these

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.139 
that so obviously you can change these
also<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.880> X<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.689> said<00:01:56.090> obviously<00:01:57.090> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
also not get X get said obviously you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.399 
also not get X get said obviously you
could<00:01:57.240> change<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.869> X<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
could change this to make X go in a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
could change this to make X go in a
different<00:01:58.530> direction<00:01:58.790> we<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.850> also<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.149> like

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
different direction we can also do like

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.480 
different direction we can also do like
player<00:02:01.310> player<00:02:02.310> dot<00:02:02.670> set<00:02:03.149> velocity<00:02:04.490> new

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
player player dot set velocity new

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.580 
player player dot set velocity new
Victoire<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:07.280> like<00:02:08.280> player<00:02:08.700> dot<00:02:09.569> gets<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.259> think

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
Victoire I like player dot gets I think

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.619 
Victoire I like player dot gets I think
it's<00:02:10.709> good<00:02:10.860> direction<00:02:11.160> when<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.510> get

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
it's good direction when it don't get

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.880 
it's good direction when it don't get
velocity<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.379> talked<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.590> lot

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
velocity it's talked a lot

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.390 
velocity it's talked a lot
t<00:02:14.010> dot<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.970> direction<00:02:15.420> no<00:02:16.080> sorry<00:02:16.800> don't<00:02:17.280> get

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
t dot get direction no sorry don't get

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600 
t dot get direction no sorry don't get
location<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.040> location<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.520> you

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
location so you get the location and you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.150 
location so you get the location and you
can<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.910> their<00:02:21.090> direction<00:02:21.720> from<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
can get their direction from it and that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.680 
can get their direction from it and that
returns<00:02:23.490> their<00:02:23.970> direction<00:02:24.270> they're<00:02:24.480> looking

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
returns their direction they're looking

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.630 
returns their direction they're looking
at<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.250> stuff<00:02:26.490> with

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
at so you can do a lot of stuff with

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
at so you can do a lot of stuff with
that<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.150> very<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.569> very<00:02:27.810> cool<00:02:27.990> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that and it's very it's very cool you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.930 
that and it's very it's very cool you
can<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.709> know<00:02:28.830> decide<00:02:29.340> where<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.760> want<00:02:29.880> to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
can you know decide where you want to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.490 
can you know decide where you want to
move<00:02:30.030> them<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.110> go<00:02:31.140> into<00:02:31.380> I

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
move them and actually if we go into I

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.830 
move them and actually if we go into I
have<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.830> server<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.130> batlike<00:02:32.280> code<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:33.690> see

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
have the server in batlike code you see

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.340 
have the server in batlike code you see
on<00:02:33.990> player<00:02:34.170> move<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.920> Catwoman<00:02:35.250> code

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
on player move for the Catwoman code

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.960 
on player move for the Catwoman code
we're<00:02:37.350> checking<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.670> an<00:02:38.760> elite

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
we're checking this is just an elite

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.380 
we're checking this is just an elite
thing<00:02:39.209> we're<00:02:40.020> setting<00:02:40.350> their<00:02:40.560> velocity<00:02:41.390> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
thing we're setting their velocity to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.570 
thing we're setting their velocity to
for<00:02:42.959> their<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.860> they're<00:02:44.069> just<00:02:44.220> gonna<00:02:44.310> keep<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
for their that they're just gonna keep a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.979 
for their that they're just gonna keep a
go<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.819> direction<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.840> we're

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
go in the direction but we're

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.410 
go in the direction but we're
multiplying<00:02:46.350> their<00:02:47.070> Y<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:48.180> we're<00:02:48.390> just

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
multiplying their Y so we're just

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.970 
multiplying their Y so we're just
basically<00:02:48.750> all<00:02:49.110> we're<00:02:49.230> doing<00:02:49.440> there<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.800> we're

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
basically all we're doing there is we're

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.050 
basically all we're doing there is we're
going<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.190> keep<00:02:50.370> them<00:02:50.520> going<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.880> same

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
going to keep them going in the same

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
going to keep them going in the same
direction<00:02:51.120> they<00:02:51.570> were<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.050> before<00:02:52.440> but

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
direction they were going in before but

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.070 
direction they were going in before but
instead<00:02:53.970> we're<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.360> add<00:02:54.420> what<00:02:54.720> stuff<00:02:54.959> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
instead we're going to add what stuff to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.320 
instead we're going to add what stuff to
go<00:02:55.170> Y<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.350> they<00:02:55.650> leap<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.610> if<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:56.820> export<00:02:57.209> this

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
go Y to they leap so if we export this

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.430 
go Y to they leap so if we export this
now<00:02:58.220> I'll<00:02:59.220> see<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.489> guys<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.940> game<00:03:00.260> alright<00:03:01.260> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
now I'll see you guys in game alright so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.590 
now I'll see you guys in game alright so
a<00:03:01.470> backing<00:03:01.739> game<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.160> if<00:03:02.760> I'm<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.450> walking

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
a backing game and if I'm just walking

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.070 
a backing game and if I'm just walking
along<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.160> do<00:03:05.220> slash<00:03:05.550> test<00:03:06.080> it's

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
along here and I do slash test it's

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.530 
along here and I do slash test it's
gonna<00:03:07.200> shoot<00:03:07.590> me<00:03:07.739> way<00:03:07.980> up<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.489> air<00:03:08.540> and

then bring me that down but that bad
black<00:03:11.790> rap<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.340> am

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
black rap down and if you see if I am

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.960 
black rap down and if you see if I am
falling<00:03:15.830> then<00:03:16.830> what's<00:03:17.370> gonna<00:03:17.489> do<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.820> it's

falling then what's gonna do is it's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.630 
falling then what's gonna do is it's
gonna<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.329> override<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.110> shoot<00:03:19.350> me<00:03:19.440> up

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640

gonna just override it and shoot me up
if<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.790> find<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> bit<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.269> water<00:03:21.570> that's<00:03:22.170> gonna

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
if I find a bit of water that's gonna

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.050 
if I find a bit of water that's gonna
move<00:03:22.620> me<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.430> make<00:03:23.640> like<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.940> little

myself up you see I'm gonna carry on

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.660 
myself up you see I'm gonna carry on
moving<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.450> sort<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.900> direction<00:03:37.670> because

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
moving in that sort of direction because

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.530 
moving in that sort of direction because
it's<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.390> overriding<00:03:39.840> my<00:03:40.110> X<00:03:40.489> velocity<00:03:41.540> it's

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
it's not overriding my X velocity it's

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.600 
it's not overriding my X velocity it's
just<00:03:42.870> changing<00:03:43.170> my<00:03:43.230> Y<00:03:43.410> velocity<00:03:43.470> my<00:03:44.070> X<00:03:44.250> can

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
just changing my Y velocity my X can

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.750 
just changing my Y velocity my X can
stay<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.209> know<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.660> same<00:03:45.870> as<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.140> was<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.519> if<00:03:47.640> I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
stay you know the same as it was so if I

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.060 
stay you know the same as it was so if I
was<00:03:47.880> moving<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.630> did<00:03:48.780> someone<00:03:49.079> else<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
was moving and if I did someone else the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.250 
was moving and if I did someone else the
X&amp;Y<00:03:50.459> would<00:03:50.790> stay<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.000> X<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> Z<00:03:51.840> but<00:03:51.989> stay<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
X&amp;Y would stay this X and Z but stay the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.720 
X&amp;Y would stay this X and Z but stay the
same<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.890> be<00:03:52.950> overriding<00:03:53.400> their<00:03:53.579> Y

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
same I just be overriding their Y

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.120 
same I just be overriding their Y
obviously<00:03:54.630> if<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.049> wanted<00:03:55.290> someone<00:03:55.620> else<00:03:55.739> you

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
obviously if you wanted someone else you

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.880 
obviously if you wanted someone else you
can<00:03:56.720> put<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.810> back<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:57.989> code<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.860> just

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
can put it back in code you can just

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.830 
can put it back in code you can just
change<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.370> player<00:03:59.549> sending<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.450> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
change the player sending it to to you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.210 
change the player sending it to to you
know<00:04:00.930> an<00:04:01.049> argument<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.769> added<00:04:01.950> which

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
know an argument that you added which

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.009 
know an argument that you added which
obviously<00:04:02.519> we<00:04:02.730> did<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> first<00:04:03.269> at<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
obviously we did in the first at the

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.990 
obviously we did in the first at the
second<00:04:04.380> tutorial<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.549> don't<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
do that go watch the second tutorial

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.009

look at sort of you know the directional

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.620 
look at sort of you know the directional
movement<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.450> I'll<00:04:15.690> see<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.930> guys<00:04:16.079> next<00:04:16.470> time
