00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
running I'll let you guys know that the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
running I'll let you guys know that the
galaxy<00:00:21.869> s4<00:00:22.140> are<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.439> least<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.830> version<00:00:23.189> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
galaxy s4 are at least this version of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.320 
galaxy s4 are at least this version of
it<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.580> running<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.800> 1.8<00:00:25.800> giga<00:00:26.010> hertz<00:00:26.330> samsung

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it is running a 1.8 giga hertz samsung

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
it is running a 1.8 giga hertz samsung
exynos<00:00:27.570> 5<00:00:28.260> octa<00:00:28.800> processor<00:00:28.830> that's<00:00:29.490> eight

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
exynos 5 octa processor that's eight

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.030 
exynos 5 octa processor that's eight
cores<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.929> course<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.470> two<00:00:31.710> gigabytes

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
cores and of course it has two gigabytes

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
cores and of course it has two gigabytes
of<00:00:32.130> RAM<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> pretty<00:00:33.450> much<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> standard

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
of RAM which is pretty much the standard

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
of RAM which is pretty much the standard
nowadays<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> high<00:00:34.890> end<00:00:34.920> android<00:00:35.309> devices

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
nowadays on the high end android devices

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.810 
nowadays on the high end android devices
and<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.570> running<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> android<00:00:37.410> 4.2<00:00:38.100> point2

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and it's running on android 4.2 point2

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.630 
and it's running on android 4.2 point2
so<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:40.350> ahead<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> finish<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.160> benchmark

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so go ahead and finish up this benchmark

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
so go ahead and finish up this benchmark
and<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.420> score<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.760> 11,000<00:00:45.200> 782<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and you see a score of 11,000 782 so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.290 
and you see a score of 11,000 782 so
obviously<00:00:47.280> blows<00:00:47.579> everything<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
obviously blows everything out of the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.819 
obviously blows everything out of the
water<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.660> far<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.170> benchmark<00:00:49.590> goes<00:00:49.710> at

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
water as far as this benchmark goes at

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
water as far as this benchmark goes at
least<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> devices<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.640> showing<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
least the devices are showing now how it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
least the devices are showing now how it
compares<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.739> newer<00:00:53.250> devices<00:00:53.579> coming<00:00:53.969> out

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
compares to newer devices coming out

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
compares to newer devices coming out
with<00:00:54.300> different<00:00:54.480> processors<00:00:55.079> we'll<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.559> but

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
with different processors we'll see but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.180 
with different processors we'll see but
pretty<00:00:57.059> impressive<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.109> ahead<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> go

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
pretty impressive we'll go ahead and go

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.560 
pretty impressive we'll go ahead and go
to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> next<00:00:59.609> benchmark<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
to the next benchmark which is going to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.260 
to the next benchmark which is going to
be<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> n<00:01:00.960> 10<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.379> benchmark<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.280> I'll<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
be the n 10 to benchmark and I'll just

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.020 
be the n 10 to benchmark and I'll just
kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> skip<00:01:03.750> through<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.369> process<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
kind of skip through the process here so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.370 
kind of skip through the process here so
that<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.330> guys<00:01:06.420> could<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that way you guys could actually see the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.929 
that way you guys could actually see the
end<00:01:07.560> result<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.189> probably<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
end result which is probably what you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
end result which is probably what you
guys<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.150> looking<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.450> anyway<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.409> this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
guys are looking for anyway so this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.190 
guys are looking for anyway so this
final<00:01:11.490> score<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.090> antutu<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.990> 20,000<00:01:14.540> 105<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
final score on antutu is 20,000 105 so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.490 
final score on antutu is 20,000 105 so
again<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.280> impressive<00:01:17.490> score<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.500> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
again a really impressive score and you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
again a really impressive score and you
know<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> obviously<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
know the obviously this is just a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
know the obviously this is just a
benchmark<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
benchmark and it's not going to be a you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
benchmark and it's not going to be a you
know<00:01:22.350> Bo<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.150> performance

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
know Bo and all for you know performance

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.730 
know Bo and all for you know performance
tests<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.430> good<00:01:26.490> indicator<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
tests but it is a good indicator and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
tests but it is a good indicator and
from<00:01:28.740> my<00:01:28.890> use<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.400> seems<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.479> galaxy<00:01:30.780> s4

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
from my use it seems like the galaxy s4

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
from my use it seems like the galaxy s4
is<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.619> fast<00:01:31.829> i<00:01:31.950> mean<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.490> galaxy

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
is really really fast i mean the galaxy

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
is really really fast i mean the galaxy
s3<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.119> fast<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> begin<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.619> not

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
s3 is fast to begin with so you're not

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
s3 is fast to begin with so you're not
really<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> notice<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.299> any<00:01:36.689> lag

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really going to notice you know any lag

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.319 
really going to notice you know any lag
at<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.500> pretty<00:01:38.009> much<00:01:38.159> ever<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> galaxy<00:01:39.030> s4

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
at all pretty much ever on the galaxy s4

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
at all pretty much ever on the galaxy s4
at<00:01:39.659> least<00:01:39.900> from<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.110> we've<00:01:40.320> seen<00:01:40.350> obviously

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
at least from what we've seen obviously

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.590 
at least from what we've seen obviously
we<00:01:41.430> had<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> test<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.360> more

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
we had to test it you know more

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
we had to test it you know more
extensively<00:01:43.170> before<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.009> final

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
extensively before we can have a final

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
extensively before we can have a final
say<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.180> final<00:01:45.689> benchmark<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
say but final benchmark here is the
