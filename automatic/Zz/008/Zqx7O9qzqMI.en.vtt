go ahead and take a look here it is in a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
go ahead and take a look here it is in a
very<00:01:16.979> bulky<00:01:17.430> example<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> knit<00:01:18.869> with

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
bulky yarn and size 10 and a half us

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929 
bulky yarn and size 10 and a half us
needles<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.680> such<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> cool<00:01:23.400> stitch<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
needles and it's such a cool stitch I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.840 
needles and it's such a cool stitch I
love<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> stitch<00:01:25.530> lies<00:01:25.920> flat<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.610> it's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
love it when a stitch lies flat and it's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
love it when a stitch lies flat and it's
identical<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.659> both<00:01:27.689> sides<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:29.759> be

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
identical on both sides so this would be

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.140 
identical on both sides so this would be
appropriate<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.979> scarves<00:01:31.979> dishcloths

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
