00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
about a 101 Scout well the first thing

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.349 
about a 101 Scout well the first thing
you<00:00:28.859> notice<00:00:29.009> about<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.759> how<00:00:29.909> low<00:00:30.150> they

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you notice about them is how low they

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.950 
you notice about them is how low they
are<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.349> machines<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.980> sit<00:00:32.430> low<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.060> the<00:00:33.390> gas

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
are the machines are sit low and the gas

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.470 
are the machines are sit low and the gas
tank<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.560> oil<00:00:34.829> tank<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.789> inside<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
tank and oil tank are up inside the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.860 
tank and oil tank are up inside the
frame<00:00:36.859> leaf<00:00:37.859> spring<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.180> girder<00:00:39.570> front

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
frame leaf spring on the girder front

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.930 
frame leaf spring on the girder front
end<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.769> not<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.949> springer<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.609> a<00:00:41.699> girder

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
end it's not a springer it's a girder

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.810 
end it's not a springer it's a girder
which<00:00:42.300> means<00:00:42.600> basically<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.820> suspension

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
which means basically the suspension

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.580 
which means basically the suspension
stays<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> forks<00:00:45.960> stay<00:00:46.199> where<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.559> are

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
stays or the forks stay where they are

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.419 
stays or the forks stay where they are
and<00:00:47.090> then<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.359> here<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.260> axle<00:00:49.739> where

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
and then down here is the axle where

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.799 
and then down here is the axle where
they<00:00:50.579> pivot<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.289> goes<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> leaf

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
they pivot so this goes up to the leaf

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
they pivot so this goes up to the leaf
spring<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.260> moves<00:00:55.769> up<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> down<00:00:56.300> and<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
spring which moves up and down and to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
spring which moves up and down and to
here<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> axle<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> actual

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
here and then the axle for the actual

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.849 
here and then the axle for the actual
wheel<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.749> here<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.260> moves<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.679> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
wheel is right here which moves up and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.249 
wheel is right here which moves up and
down<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.969> damper<00:01:03.839> as<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.410> damper<00:01:04.830> rod<00:01:05.000> to

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
down this is a damper as a damper rod to

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.830 
down this is a damper as a damper rod to
basically<00:01:07.259> smooth<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> bumps<00:01:08.570> up<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
basically smooth out the bumps up on the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
basically smooth out the bumps up on the
Front's<00:01:10.200> very<00:01:10.380> clean<00:01:10.740> designs<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> single

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
Front's very clean designs got a single

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.149 
Front's very clean designs got a single
headlight<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.140> got<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> horn<00:01:13.650> mounted<00:01:14.009> right

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
headlight it's got a horn mounted right

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.410 
headlight it's got a horn mounted right
under<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.259> fabled<00:01:16.259> Indian<00:01:17.030> face<00:01:18.030> on

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
under it with the fabled Indian face on

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
under it with the fabled Indian face on
the<00:01:18.750> horn<00:01:20.149> on<00:01:21.149> several<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> models<00:01:22.710> they

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the horn on several of the models they

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.889 
the horn on several of the models they
this<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> John<00:01:23.670> Brown<00:01:23.880> which<00:01:24.210> says<00:01:24.450> Indian

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
this is the John Brown which says Indian

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.679 
this is the John Brown which says Indian
right<00:01:25.079> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.619> headlight<00:01:26.040> rim<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.689> believe

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
right on the headlight rim I believe

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.580 
right on the headlight rim I believe
that<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.290> couple<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.649> years<00:01:30.350> this<00:01:31.350> one

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that was just a couple of years this one

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.280 
that was just a couple of years this one
is<00:01:31.770> set<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:32.640> throttle<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
is set up for a right throttle so the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
is set up for a right throttle so the
throttle<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> here<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.759> over<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> left

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
throttle is here and over on the left

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.230 
throttle is here and over on the left
side<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> hand<00:01:37.590> shifter<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.369> usually<00:01:39.180> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
side is the hand shifter and usually you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.700 
side is the hand shifter and usually you
can<00:01:39.420> tell<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.170> by<00:01:40.409> where<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
can tell which is which by where the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
can tell which is which by where the
shifter<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.640> pretty<00:01:41.880> unusual<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.750> have

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
shifter is it's pretty unusual to have

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
shifter is it's pretty unusual to have
the<00:01:42.990> shifter<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> throttle<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> same

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the shifter in the throttle on the same

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.830 
the shifter in the throttle on the same
side<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.509> hard<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.590> work<00:01:47.159> them<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
side as it's hard to to work them the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.889 
side as it's hard to to work them the
ignition<00:01:49.259> switch<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.570> really

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
