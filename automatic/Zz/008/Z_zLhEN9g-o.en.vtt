00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.369 

and<00:02:39.189> then<00:02:39.370> continue<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:39.969> the<00:02:40.120> D<00:02:40.299> chord<00:02:40.659> down

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
and then continue on the D chord down

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.209 
and then continue on the D chord down
down<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.159> up<00:02:42.459> down<00:02:42.969> and<00:02:43.359> then<00:02:43.930> see<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.739> got<00:02:44.890> two

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
down up up down and then see you got two

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.009 
down up up down and then see you got two
options<00:02:45.370> here<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.939> go<00:02:46.150> down<00:02:46.540> down<00:02:46.989> up

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
options here you can go down down up

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.949 
options here you can go down down up
down<00:02:47.439> down<00:02:47.769> up<00:02:47.920> down<00:02:48.370> down<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.909> down<00:02:49.120> down<00:02:49.900> up

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
down down up down down up down down up

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.220 
down down up down down up down down up
so<00:02:50.769> what<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:50.980> sounds<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:51.400> slows<00:02:51.939> down<00:02:52.780> down

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
so what it sounds like slows down down

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.649 
so what it sounds like slows down down
up<00:02:53.769> down<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.299> down<00:02:55.599> down<00:02:56.409> up<00:02:56.469> down<00:02:57.010> down<00:02:57.400> up

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
up down up up down down up down down up

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.150 
up down up up down down up down down up
or<00:02:58.659> down<00:02:59.079> down

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.430 

or<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.460> could<00:03:03.700> get<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.330> little<00:03:04.570> funkier<00:03:05.110> with

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
or you could get a little funkier with

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.580 
or you could get a little funkier with
the<00:03:05.560> C<00:03:05.740> chord<00:03:06.010> too<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:10.720> down<00:03:11.080> down

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
the C chord too like this up down down

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.790 
the C chord too like this up down down
up<00:03:11.650> down

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
up down

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.050 
up down
up<00:03:13.340> down<00:03:13.700> down<00:03:14.240> up

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
up down down up

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.229 
up down down up
so<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.200> it's<00:03:17.319> up<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.560> speed

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.270 

now<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> reason<00:03:25.319> why<00:03:25.379> I'm<00:03:25.500> showing<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
now the reason why I'm showing you the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.729 
now the reason why I'm showing you the
down<00:03:26.519> down-up<00:03:27.000> part<00:03:27.599> on<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.049> C<00:03:28.260> chord<00:03:28.469> is<00:03:28.620> if

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
down down-up part on that C chord is if

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.740 
down down-up part on that C chord is if
you're<00:03:28.829> gonna<00:03:28.950> sing<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.299> little

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
you're gonna sing this it's a little

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.649 
you're gonna sing this it's a little
easier<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:32.040> strum<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.939> first<00:03:33.329> pattern

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
easier to strum that first pattern

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.869 
easier to strum that first pattern
that's<00:03:33.989> down<00:03:34.260> down<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.859> pattern<00:03:35.159> on<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> C

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
that's down down the pattern on the C

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:47.710 
that's down down the pattern on the C
like<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.840> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:59.020 

but<00:03:48.230> if<00:03:48.320> you're<00:03:48.410> not<00:03:48.530> singing

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.210 

and<00:03:59.870> really<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.650> think<00:04:00.710> about<00:04:00.860> it

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
and really if you think about it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.730 
and really if you think about it
whatever<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:02.210> easier<00:04:02.870> for<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.230> strum

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
whatever is easier for you to strum

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.800 
whatever is easier for you to strum
while<00:04:04.190> you're<00:04:04.430> singing<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.000> playing<00:04:05.150> if<00:04:05.510> you

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
while you're singing and playing if you

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.330 
while you're singing and playing if you
want<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.260> sing<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.620> I'm<00:04:06.680> assuming<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.250> you

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
want it to sing and I'm assuming if you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.190 
want it to sing and I'm assuming if you
like<00:04:07.520> Glee<00:04:07.850> you're<00:04:08.090> gonna<00:04:08.510> want<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.780> sing<00:04:09.020> this

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
like Glee you're gonna want to sing this

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.770 
like Glee you're gonna want to sing this
because<00:04:09.740> they<00:04:10.190> sing<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.730> lot<00:04:10.880> in<00:04:11.120> glee<00:04:11.360> in<00:04:11.630> case

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
because they sing a lot in glee in case

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.370 
because they sing a lot in glee in case
you<00:04:11.990> don't<00:04:12.140> know<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:14.630> want<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.900> modify<00:04:15.140> your

you don't know you want to modify your

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.050 
you don't know you want to modify your
strumming<00:04:15.770> pattern<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.400> know<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.579> fit<00:04:16.970> your
