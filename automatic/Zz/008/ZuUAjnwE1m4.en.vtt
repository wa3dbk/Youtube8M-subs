think<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> last<00:01:32.220> hit<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
think it was that last hit just just the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910 
think it was that last hit just just the
last<00:01:33.630> night<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.229> last<00:01:34.409> few<00:01:34.680> heats

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
last night I think the last few heats

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
last night I think the last few heats
started<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> struggle<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.850> consistency<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
started to struggle for consistency so a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.380 
started to struggle for consistency so a
bit<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> shame<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> end<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> note

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
bit of a shame to end it on that note

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
bit of a shame to end it on that note
today<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.340> looks<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
today but you know it looks like a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
today but you know it looks like a
couple<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.150> sorting<00:01:42.540> days<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.320> think

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
couple of sorting days I don't think

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.240 
couple of sorting days I don't think
anyone<00:01:43.799> knows<00:01:43.979> exactly<00:01:44.340> what's<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
anyone knows exactly what's going to be

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.410 
anyone knows exactly what's going to be
that<00:01:45.400> everything<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:45.850> going<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.000> be<00:01:46.090> like<00:01:46.360> I

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
that everything is going to be like I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.550 
that everything is going to be like I
think<00:01:46.690> it's<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.900> little<00:01:47.020> bit<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.290> hit<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.500> miss

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
think it's a little bit of hit and miss

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.520 
think it's a little bit of hit and miss
with<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.920> cyclone<00:01:48.400> but<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.510> could<00:01:49.690> be<00:01:49.840> could<00:01:50.470> be

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
with a cyclone but it could be could be

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.130 
with a cyclone but it could be could be
some<00:01:50.770> size<00:01:50.980> could<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.610> rough<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.120> hey<00:01:52.840> if<00:01:52.990> it'd

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.320 
some size could be rough and hey if it'd
make<00:01:53.170> for<00:01:53.290> an<00:01:53.500> exciting<00:01:53.590> finish<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.700> they<00:01:54.880> are
