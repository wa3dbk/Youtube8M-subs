Atari<00:02:07.979> 2600<00:02:08.580> version<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.209> played<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.570> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
Atari 2600 version was played with the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630 
Atari 2600 version was played with the
joystick<00:02:10.380> there<00:02:10.590> isn't<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.979> light<00:02:11.190> gun<00:02:11.400> for

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
joystick there isn't a light gun for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.660 
joystick there isn't a light gun for
that<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> pretty<00:02:14.520> good

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
that thing and it was a pretty good

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.060 
that thing and it was a pretty good
version<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.209> game<00:02:15.390> for<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> Atari<00:02:16.350> 2600

but<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.880> vastly<00:02:18.540> superior<00:02:18.900> even<00:02:23.660> though

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
but this is vastly superior even though

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.330 
but this is vastly superior even though
the<00:02:24.780> light<00:02:24.930> gun<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.380> terribly<00:02:26.040> accurate

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the light gun is not terribly accurate

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.130 
the light gun is not terribly accurate
and<00:02:26.730> there's<00:02:26.850> no<00:02:26.940> calibration<00:02:27.270> screen<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
and there's no calibration screen you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.630 
and there's no calibration screen you
can<00:02:28.260> at<00:02:28.350> least<00:02:28.380> aim<00:02:28.770> all<00:02:29.040> over<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> screen

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
can at least aim all over the screen
