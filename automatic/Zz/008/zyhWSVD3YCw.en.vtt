men gaining the best qualifications we

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
men gaining the best qualifications we
seem<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:47.309> down<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:47.850> work<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
seem to get down with our work and I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
seem to get down with our work and I
suppose<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:48.780> why<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.160> well<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
suppose that's why we do so well in

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
suppose that's why we do so well in
University<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.300> College<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.780> was<00:00:51.960> sort<00:00:52.559> of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
University and College I was sort of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
University and College I was sort of
handing<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.039> my<00:00:53.070> assays<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> day

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
handing in my assays on the day

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
handing in my assays on the day
obviously<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.230> cramming<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> night

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
obviously I was there cramming the night

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
obviously I was there cramming the night
before<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.730> seems<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> me<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
before but seems to me that a lot of the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
before but seems to me that a lot of the
girls<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.469> had<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> done<00:00:58.859> no<00:00:59.370> work<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> lot

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
girls that had it done no work a lot

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
girls that had it done no work a lot
harder<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.379> more<00:01:01.590> peer

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
harder there's like a lot more peer

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
harder there's like a lot more peer
pressure<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.280> boys<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:02.879> drinking<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
pressure on boys to go out drinking and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
pressure on boys to go out drinking and
meet<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:03.960> girls<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> girls

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
meet up with girls and I think the girls

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120 
meet up with girls and I think the girls
are<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:06.030> likely<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> stay<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.840> home<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.439> read

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
are more likely to stay at home and read

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.390 
are more likely to stay at home and read
and<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:09.060> their<00:01:09.240> homework<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.830> researchers

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and do their homework the researchers

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
and do their homework the researchers
found<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> growth<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.240> university<00:01:12.869> numbers
