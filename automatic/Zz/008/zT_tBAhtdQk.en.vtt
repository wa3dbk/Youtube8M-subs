is<00:03:28.079> standard<00:03:28.650> android<00:03:29.099> 3.1<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:29.910> sheba<00:03:30.209> didn't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
is standard android 3.1 so sheba didn't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.500 
is standard android 3.1 so sheba didn't
go<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.900> layer<00:03:31.769> its<00:03:32.040> own<00:03:32.280> custom<00:03:32.940> skin<00:03:33.299> on<00:03:33.480> top

go and layer its own custom skin on top

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.330 
go and layer its own custom skin on top
what<00:03:33.900> i<00:03:33.930> did<00:03:34.169> do<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.410> bundle<00:03:34.769> some<00:03:34.919> apps<00:03:35.130> that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
what i did do is bundle some apps that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.030 
what i did do is bundle some apps that
it<00:03:35.459> thinks<00:03:35.669> you<00:03:36.359> might<00:03:36.599> find<00:03:36.900> useful<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.889> this

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
it thinks you might find useful so this

it thinks you might find useful so this
includes<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.609> native<00:03:38.970> file<00:03:39.239> manager<00:03:39.750> because

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
includes a native file manager because

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.199 
includes a native file manager because
android<00:03:40.859> natively<00:03:41.190> doesn't<00:03:41.519> come<00:03:41.970> with<00:03:42.090> its

android natively doesn't come with its

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.140 
android natively doesn't come with its
own<00:03:42.329> file<00:03:42.630> manager<00:03:43.109> so<00:03:44.040> if<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.730> get<00:03:44.880> up<00:03:45.000> close

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
own file manager so if you get up close

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150 
own file manager so if you get up close
here<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.599> can<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.079> you've<00:03:46.349> got<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.829> list

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
here you can see that you've got a list

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.940 
here you can see that you've got a list
of<00:03:47.430> different<00:03:47.959> files<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.410> there<00:03:49.829> are

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
of different files and there are

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.970 
of different files and there are
actually<00:03:50.989> little<00:03:51.989> thumbnails<00:03:52.470> depending<00:03:52.889> on

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
actually little thumbnails depending on

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.190 
actually little thumbnails depending on
what<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.669> this<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> movie<00:03:54.989> with<00:03:55.169> a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
what it is so this is a movie with a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.289 
what it is so this is a movie with a
puppy<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.859> so<00:03:56.099> if<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.880> look<00:03:57.030> closely

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
puppy in it so if you look closely

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.589 
puppy in it so if you look closely
you've<00:03:57.660> got<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> little<00:03:58.169> puppy<00:03:59.359> thumbnail<00:04:00.359> not

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
you've got a little puppy thumbnail not

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.030 
you've got a little puppy thumbnail not
sure<00:04:00.750> if<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.870> actually<00:04:01.410> shows<00:04:01.440> up<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
sure if that actually shows up in the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.720 
sure if that actually shows up in the
video<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.340> but<00:04:02.790> bear<00:04:03.389> with<00:04:03.419> me<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.769> then<00:04:05.609> you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
video here but bear with me so then you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.120 
video here but bear with me so then you
can<00:04:05.880> go<00:04:06.060> by<00:04:06.299> where<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.349> stores<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.980> is

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
can go by where it stores this is

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.250 
can go by where it stores this is
internal<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:08.849> you<00:04:08.910> can<00:04:09.060> go<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.269> SD<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.139> then

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
internal but you can go to SD and then

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.839 
internal but you can go to SD and then
if<00:04:10.409> you<00:04:10.500> had<00:04:10.680> something<00:04:10.920> stored<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.459> USB

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
if you had something stored in a USB

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.350 
if you had something stored in a USB
peripheral<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:13.140> could<00:04:13.349> go<00:04:13.500> there<00:04:13.680> too

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
peripheral you could go there too

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.850 
peripheral you could go there too
so<00:04:16.360> you<00:04:16.660> see<00:04:16.810> when<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:16.959> tap<00:04:17.050> nothing<00:04:17.530> happens

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
so you see when I tap nothing happens

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.949 
so you see when I tap nothing happens
because<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:18.040> don't<00:04:18.190> happen<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.520> have<00:04:18.610> anything

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
because I don't happen to have anything

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.490 
because I don't happen to have anything
plugged<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.170> right<00:04:20.200> now<00:04:20.550> so<00:04:21.960> there's<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.200> and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
plugged in right now so there's that and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.350 
plugged in right now so there's that and
then<00:04:23.880> toshiba<00:04:24.880> also<00:04:25.210> added<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.910> printer

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
then toshiba also added this printer

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.480 
then toshiba also added this printer
share<00:04:28.630> utility<00:04:29.140> here<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:30.160> I'm<00:04:30.220> going<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.400> get

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
share utility here so I'm going to get

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.860 
share utility here so I'm going to get
up<00:04:30.670> close<00:04:30.910> this<00:04:31.180> is<00:04:31.330> how<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.510> would

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
up close this is how you would

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.210 
up close this is how you would
wirelessly<00:04:32.140> print<00:04:32.770> something<00:04:32.980> because

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
wirelessly print something because

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.280 
wirelessly print something because
obviously<00:04:33.370> most<00:04:33.850> printers<00:04:34.150> are<00:04:34.420> not<00:04:34.600> designed

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
obviously most printers are not designed

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.070 
obviously most printers are not designed
to<00:04:35.410> be<00:04:35.560> compatible<00:04:35.680> with<00:04:36.840> tablets<00:04:37.840> I'm

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
to be compatible with tablets I'm

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.190 
to be compatible with tablets I'm
including<00:04:38.380> Android<00:04:38.920> one<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.490> then<00:04:40.330> excuse<00:04:41.080> me

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
including Android one so then excuse me

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.620 
including Android one so then excuse me
there<00:04:41.350> accidentally<00:04:41.950> tapped<00:04:42.190> out<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.630> you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
there accidentally tapped out of it you

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.240 
there accidentally tapped out of it you
can<00:04:43.720> go<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> your<00:04:43.990> destination<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:44.740> say<00:04:44.890> wanted

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
can go to your destination so say wanted

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.550 
can go to your destination so say wanted
to<00:04:45.340> print<00:04:45.460> something<00:04:45.670> from<00:04:45.940> gmail<00:04:46.440> then<00:04:47.440> you

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
to print something from gmail then you

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.080 
to print something from gmail then you
would<00:04:47.680> see<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> list<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.220> your<00:04:48.280> emails<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.000> then

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
would see a list of your emails and then

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.180 
would see a list of your emails and then
you<00:04:49.210> could<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.600> print<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.620> one<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.890> wanted

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
you could just print the one you wanted

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.860 
you could just print the one you wanted
so<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.730> isn't<00:04:52.030> actually<00:04:52.150> connected<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.840> a

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
so this isn't actually connected to a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.050 
so this isn't actually connected to a
local<00:04:53.080> Wi-Fi<00:04:53.350> network<00:04:53.830> here<00:04:54.010> but<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.460> think<00:04:54.760> you

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
local Wi-Fi network here but I think you

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.100 
local Wi-Fi network here but I think you
get<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.240> idea<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.780> terms<00:04:55.960> of<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:56.590> usability

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
get the idea in terms of the usability

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.510 
get the idea in terms of the usability
one<00:04:59.110> last<00:04:59.290> thing<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.590> wanted<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.950> show<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.160> is

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
one last thing I wanted to show you is

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.310 
one last thing I wanted to show you is
the<00:05:00.550> removable<00:05:01.240> battery<00:05:01.630> just<00:05:01.840> because<00:05:02.170> this

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
the removable battery just because this

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.500 
the removable battery just because this
is<00:05:02.440> such<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.620> unique<00:05:02.800> feature<00:05:03.400> for<00:05:03.910> tablets<00:05:04.420> you

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
is such a unique feature for tablets you

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.240 
is such a unique feature for tablets you
really<00:05:04.720> don't<00:05:04.870> see<00:05:05.050> this<00:05:05.170> very<00:05:05.290> often<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:06.010> if<00:05:06.160> I

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
really don't see this very often so if I

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.880 
really don't see this very often so if I
wanted<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.700> could<00:05:06.730> take<00:05:07.030> off<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:08.080> cover<00:05:08.650> that

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
wanted I could take off that cover that

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.700 
wanted I could take off that cover that
I<00:05:08.950> was<00:05:09.070> just<00:05:09.220> showing<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:10.290> I<00:05:11.290> could<00:05:11.560> use

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
I was just showing you and I could use

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.310 
I was just showing you and I could use
these<00:05:12.250> lock<00:05:12.580> levers<00:05:13.570> over<00:05:13.990> here<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:15.180> just<00:05:16.320> pop

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
these lock levers over here and just pop

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.630 
these lock levers over here and just pop
it<00:05:17.470> out<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:17.620> for<00:05:18.160> those<00:05:18.220> of<00:05:18.280> you<00:05:18.490> who<00:05:18.610> are

interested this is what it looks like
you<00:05:22.660> can<00:05:22.810> see<00:05:23.020> here<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.500> camera<00:05:24.370> hardware<00:05:24.640> is

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
you can see here the camera hardware is

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.450 
you can see here the camera hardware is
over<00:05:25.540> here<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.680> I'm<00:05:26.740> going<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.920> set<00:05:27.100> this<00:05:27.250> down

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
over here so I'm going to set this down

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.920 
over here so I'm going to set this down
and<00:05:27.760> just<00:05:27.850> show<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.090> what<00:05:28.360> you<00:05:28.480> can<00:05:28.510> use<00:05:28.750> to

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
and just show you what you can use to

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.870 
and just show you what you can use to
complement<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.530> so<00:05:29.860> one<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.700> cool<00:05:30.850> things

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
complement it so one of the cool things

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.030 
complement it so one of the cool things
is<00:05:31.180> not<00:05:31.480> only<00:05:31.630> is<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.840> battery<00:05:32.170> removable<00:05:32.680> but

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
is not only is the battery removable but

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.450 
is not only is the battery removable but
you<00:05:33.220> can<00:05:33.370> actually<00:05:33.550> buy<00:05:34.380> snap<00:05:35.380> in<00:05:35.620> cases<00:05:36.130> in<00:05:36.340> a

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
you can actually buy snap in cases in a
