that<00:00:59.720> out<00:00:59.899> it's<00:01:00.140> really<00:01:00.379> annoying<00:01:00.620> but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
that out it's really annoying but

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.130 
that out it's really annoying but
nothing<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:02.360> can<00:01:02.480> do<00:01:02.570> about<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:02.809> huh<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:05.659> like

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
nothing you can do about it huh so like

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.570 
nothing you can do about it huh so like
I<00:01:06.260> said<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.470> have<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.710> meta<00:01:06.860> scoring<00:01:07.190> on<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:07.520> I

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
I said I have the meta scoring on so I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.690 
I said I have the meta scoring on so I
can<00:01:07.610> tell<00:01:07.970> when<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:08.510> make<00:01:08.750> these<00:01:08.930> shots<00:01:09.260> and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
can tell when I make these shots and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.230 
can tell when I make these shots and
it's<00:01:10.700> very<00:01:10.909> useful<00:01:11.360> because<00:01:12.759> if<00:01:13.759> I<00:01:13.850> didn't<00:01:14.150> I

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's very useful because if I didn't I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.609 
it's very useful because if I didn't I
don't<00:01:14.330> think<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.600> would<00:01:14.750> know<00:01:14.930> half<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.470> time

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
don't think I would know half the time

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.190 
don't think I would know half the time
when<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.860> would<00:01:16.009> make<00:01:16.130> these<00:01:16.310> shots<00:01:17.080> there<00:01:18.080> are

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
when I would make these shots there are

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.109 
when I would make these shots there are
two<00:01:18.409> brutes<00:01:18.680> after<00:01:19.250> you're<00:01:19.550> done<00:01:19.700> killing<00:01:20.000> all

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
two brutes after you're done killing all

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.109 
two brutes after you're done killing all
the<00:01:20.240> grunts<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.740> after<00:01:22.159> you're<00:01:22.550> done<00:01:22.640> sniping

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
the grunts so after you're done sniping

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.670 
the grunts so after you're done sniping
in<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.330> run<00:01:23.690> down<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.080> street<00:01:24.350> that<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.500> can

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
in a run down the street that you can

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680 
in a run down the street that you can
see<00:01:24.830> down<00:01:25.009> right<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.580> pick<00:01:26.300> up<00:01:26.450> one<00:01:26.659> of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
see down right now and pick up one of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.859 
see down right now and pick up one of
the<00:01:26.869> laser<00:01:27.350> pistols<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.660> from<00:01:29.660> the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the laser pistols that you from the

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.320 
the laser pistols that you from the
grunts<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.289> you<00:01:30.380> killed<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.880> right<00:01:32.300> now

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
grunts that you killed so right now

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.910 
grunts that you killed so right now
seems<00:01:32.780> like<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.930> good<00:01:32.990> time<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.350> think<00:01:33.500> all<00:01:33.800> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
seems like a good time I think all the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.999 
seems like a good time I think all the
grunts<00:01:34.190> are<00:01:34.280> dead<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:35.560> think<00:01:36.560> there<00:01:36.680> might<00:01:36.770> be

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
grunts are dead I think there might be

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.950 
grunts are dead I think there might be
one<00:01:37.369> or<00:01:37.460> two<00:01:37.490> left<00:01:37.700> in<00:01:37.850> these<00:01:37.940> brooch<00:01:38.690> always

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
spawn with different weapons every time

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.490

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500

just<00:06:30.250> really<00:06:30.430> low<00:06:30.670> on<00:06:30.700> pistol<00:06:31.120> ammo

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.800

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
the head too if you aim it well enough

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.180 
the head too if you aim it well enough
and<00:06:41.900> go<00:06:42.900> back<00:06:43.050> in<00:06:43.169> the<00:06:43.259> sniper<00:06:43.530> power<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:44.069> get

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
and go back in the sniper power to get

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.409 
and go back in the sniper power to get

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
that a sniper rifle switch it out for

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.149 
that a sniper rifle switch it out for
your<00:06:48.720> laser<00:06:48.900> pistol<00:06:49.349> not<00:06:49.710> going<00:06:49.860> to<00:06:49.919> need<00:06:50.039> it

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
your laser pistol not going to need it

00:06:50.159 --> 00:07:00.279 
your laser pistol not going to need it
really<00:06:50.280> and<00:06:52.220> glitch

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.649 

and<00:07:00.409> that's<00:07:01.069> it<00:07:01.219> for<00:07:01.339> this<00:07:01.430> part<00:07:01.909> so<00:07:02.240> we'll<00:07:02.509> see

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:02.659
