lost stops I tried get out and run I

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.360 
lost stops I tried get out and run I
think<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.240> we<00:02:45.480> jump<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.900> them<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:47.160> could

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
think that we jump on them that it could

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.090 
think that we jump on them that it could
set<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.450> tone<00:02:48.660> for<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> game<00:02:49.020> especially<00:02:49.680> in

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
set the tone for the game especially in

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.430 
set the tone for the game especially in
early<00:02:50.310> game<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.840> that's<00:02:52.290> what

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
early game like that so that's what

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.740 
early game like that so that's what
we're<00:02:52.560> gonna<00:02:52.709> try<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:59.510> never<00:03:00.510> thought<00:03:00.690> about
