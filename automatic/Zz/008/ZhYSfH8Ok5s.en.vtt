00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.369 

this<00:00:04.350> wasn't<00:00:04.650> as<00:00:04.920> raggedy<00:00:05.509> as<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.839> as<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.230> was

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
this wasn't as raggedy as I as I was

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.549 
this wasn't as raggedy as I as I was
expecting<00:00:07.710> it<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.069> be<00:00:08.809> usually<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.990> go<00:00:10.170> you

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
expecting it to be usually you go you

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.220 
expecting it to be usually you go you
know<00:00:10.679> from<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> inner<00:00:11.880> spring<00:00:12.090> ball<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
know from the inner spring ball to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.169 
know from the inner spring ball to
August<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.830> you're<00:00:14.280> all<00:00:14.519> excited<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.120> first

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
August and you're all excited at first

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
August and you're all excited at first
practice<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:15.960> off<00:00:16.139> when<00:00:16.410> spring<00:00:16.859> ball<00:00:17.039> is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
practice just off when spring ball is

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.820 
practice just off when spring ball is
not<00:00:17.730> much<00:00:17.940> different<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.109> thought<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.800> had

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
not much different I thought we had

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.620 
not much different I thought we had
pretty<00:00:20.070> good<00:00:20.189> body<00:00:20.550> control<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.480> today

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
pretty good body control out here today

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.109 
pretty good body control out here today
and<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.960> thought<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.350> responded<00:00:22.529> well

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
and I thought we responded well

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.099 
and I thought we responded well
schematically<00:00:24.119> both<00:00:24.390> offensively<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
schematically both offensively and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929 
schematically both offensively and
defensively<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.160> thought<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> tempo<00:00:26.789> was

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
defensively and I thought the tempo was

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.340 
defensively and I thought the tempo was
really<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.660> good<00:00:28.429> linebackers<00:00:32.270> yeah<00:00:33.350> it's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
really very good linebackers yeah it's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580 
really very good linebackers yeah it's
certainly<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.780> probably<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
certainly the you know probably the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.090 
certainly the you know probably the
youngest<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.960> group<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.410> defensive<00:00:40.920> side

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
youngest a group on the defensive side

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.240 
youngest a group on the defensive side
of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> ball<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.230> maybe<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
of the ball and and you know maybe the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
of the ball and and you know maybe the
thinnest<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.960> entire<00:00:46.200> front<00:00:46.500> seven

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
thinnest as well the entire front seven

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.770 
thinnest as well the entire front seven
is<00:00:47.460> both<00:00:48.000> young<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.329> green<00:00:49.789> what<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> saw<00:00:51.329> out

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
is both young and green what I saw out

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
is both young and green what I saw out
of<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.739> group<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.309> well<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
of out of that group as well as the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
of out of that group as well as the
front<00:00:54.300> guys<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.800> running

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
front guys that I think we're running

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
front guys that I think we're running
better<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> front<00:00:58.199> seven<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
better with with the front seven and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
better with with the front seven and
then<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.219> overall<00:00:59.670> Jake<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> AJ

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
then we have overall Jake and AJ

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
then we have overall Jake and AJ
certainly<00:01:01.050> ran<00:01:01.260> Willie<00:01:01.500> went<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.010> well

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
certainly ran Willie went really well

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
certainly ran Willie went really well
but<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.030> wasn't<00:01:03.210> anybody<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.840> there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but there wasn't anybody out there

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
but there wasn't anybody out there
amongst<00:01:04.530> those<00:01:04.619> linebackers<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.400> didn't

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
amongst those linebackers that didn't

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.050

those<00:01:25.350> expectations<00:01:25.770> climb<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.450> even

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
those expectations climb and and even

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.179 
those expectations climb and and even
though<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.200> team<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> younger<00:01:29.040> than

past I think that's important for him I
don't<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:35.180> quiet<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
don't think you can be quiet and be the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.720 
don't think you can be quiet and be the
leading<00:02:37.560> quarterback<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> football<00:02:38.580> team

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
leading quarterback on a football team

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.280 
leading quarterback on a football team
and<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.420> thought<00:02:39.450> he<00:02:39.750> was<00:02:39.900> different<00:02:40.080> in

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
and I and I thought he was different in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.520 
and I and I thought he was different in
that<00:02:40.320> regard<00:02:40.560> today<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.820> everybody

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
that regard today like everybody

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.230 
that regard today like everybody
everybody's<00:02:43.530> improve<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.920> everything<00:02:44.460> and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
everybody's improve on everything and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.670 
everybody's improve on everything and
and<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:46.280> thought<00:02:47.280> both<00:02:47.550> grant<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.180> Sam's<00:02:48.680> arms

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and I thought both grant and Sam's arms

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.580 
and I thought both grant and Sam's arms
look<00:02:50.550> stronger<00:02:51.080> than<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:52.230> did<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:52.410> we

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
look stronger than they did when we

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.200 
look stronger than they did when we
finished<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.280> December<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.030> that's

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
finished in December and that's

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.880 
finished in December and that's
encouraged<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.960> comes<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.320> nine<00:02:55.620> hard

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
encouraged and that comes from nine hard

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.310 
encouraged and that comes from nine hard
weeks<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.310> training<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.720> your<00:02:57.930> your
