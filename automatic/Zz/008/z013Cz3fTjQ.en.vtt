of the third one and grab it and then

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.050 
of the third one and grab it and then
put<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.750> last<00:03:14.930> bucket<00:03:15.319> in<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.830> corner<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:17.000> if

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
put the last bucket in the corner but if

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.420 
put the last bucket in the corner but if
you<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.209> with<00:03:17.360> for<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:18.769> still<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.190> grab

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
you do with for you still have to grab

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.979 
you do with for you still have to grab
it<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.000> little<00:03:20.239> bit<00:03:20.360> easier<00:03:20.540> because

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it but it's a little bit easier because

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.710 
it but it's a little bit easier because
now<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.049> place<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.980> then<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.160> can<00:03:25.720> just

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
now you place it and then you can just

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.080 
now you place it and then you can just
watch<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.200> video<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:31.640> kind<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.819> hard<00:03:32.030> to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
watch the video it's kind of hard to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.089 
watch the video it's kind of hard to
explain<00:03:32.239> let<00:03:32.870> me<00:03:32.959> see<00:03:33.200> how<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.590> take<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.040> away

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
explain let me see how I take it away

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.289 
explain let me see how I take it away
and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:35.230> does<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.819> you<00:03:37.819> have<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.150> do

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
and then it does that you have to do

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.440 
and then it does that you have to do
that<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.829> do<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.760> other<00:03:40.879> way<00:03:41.060> it'll

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
that if you do the other way it'll

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.720 
that if you do the other way it'll
overflow<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.900> do<00:03:45.079> not<00:03:45.379> want<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.310> now

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
overflow you do not want that and now

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.850 
overflow you do not want that and now
get<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.180> lava<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.780> place<00:03:48.500> them<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:48.769> the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
get you lava and place them in the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.240 
get you lava and place them in the
corner<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.850> bottom<00:03:50.389> layer<00:03:51.069> you'll<00:03:52.069> see

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
corner of the bottom layer you'll see

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.370 
corner of the bottom layer you'll see
it'll<00:03:52.609> flow<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.420> I'll<00:03:53.480> make<00:03:53.600> cobblestone<00:03:54.200> on

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
it'll flow and I'll make cobblestone on

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.990 
it'll flow and I'll make cobblestone on
the<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.769> sides<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.700> put<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:55.940> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
the on the sides and you put it the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.090 
the on the sides and you put it the
other<00:03:56.030> one<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.540> now<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.590> whole<00:03:57.889> layer

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
other one and now that the whole layer

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.490 
other one and now that the whole layer
will<00:03:58.370> be<00:03:58.400> cobblestone<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.239> only<00:03:59.989> mine<00:04:00.230> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
will be cobblestone and only mine the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.789 
will be cobblestone and only mine the
two<00:04:00.680> middle<00:04:00.920> ones<00:04:02.019> they<00:04:03.019> will<00:04:03.200> keep<00:04:03.349> going

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
two middle ones they will keep going

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.740 
two middle ones they will keep going
back<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.099> back<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:06.459> it'll<00:04:07.459> just<00:04:07.639> be<00:04:08.389> forever

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750
