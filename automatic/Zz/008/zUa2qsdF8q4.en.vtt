00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 ok guys then today let's play at a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.560
 game that none of you believe can 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.719
 to expect 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.110
 well what I saw to show it 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.809
 slider for iphone which we are on an iphone 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.539
 4s is seen that I downloaded this 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.900
 I play and I really enjoyed it 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.380
 I'll show you I'm recording with one 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.000
 HD video camera quality will not be 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 exceptional but I wanted to force 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 show it to you so nothing we do e 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.829
 chance farscape we do in mode 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.899
 day and we make the map there are the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.219
 mafia and the map of the cemetery the map 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.500
 of the city 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.410
 we will naturally make the mortar for the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 cemetery then remained in severance 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.809
 free skate eyes I need to find signs 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.910
 Well we start to escape 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.390
 no name of you the scenario is 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.530
 practically identical I look for guys 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.220
 to show as much as possible 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.850
 of course but I can't do too much 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.890
 unfortunately the means do not lend you know 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 however the graphics are really nothing 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 bad if you see the little square like this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 blurred and just the game like that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 guys anyway how to say nothing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 graphics are not bad at all but rather videos 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.570
 tell the truth and I'm showing it in 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.979
 how much he left me pleasantly 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.680
 surprised the scares above all are 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.170
 quite big enough 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.140
 so how can you observe and is a 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.200
 game really made greer and in my opinion 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.659
 really has nothing to envy to al 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.880
 his we could say elder brother e 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.250
 would be the one for the computer now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.009
 videos are seen on the under but this is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.130
 really well done I wanted to say 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 you can't try it and review it with you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 come the atmosphere that is created 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.649
 pretty nice that we're playing in 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.810
 day mode but we have another 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.030
 night mode this does not consider it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.820
 boys indeed temples as I want 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.980
 just show you what it is 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.040
 is 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.000
 so nothing this trip does not 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:17.060
 we can run like on the computer name 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.820
 the temples have seen the slider several times 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.730
 I recently did the rounds that roll 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.770
 I honestly recommended one 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.740
 disappointment in how much how to say 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.360
 oh guys you can be 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.580
 in short, the other moment 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.820
 however focus on camera 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.360
 damn, anyway, I said that I have 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.930
 slam disappointment considered disappointment 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.020
 as it was it is too monotonous and 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.140
 repetitive and slow we can say 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.510
 as a game while the other landers can 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.150
 say that they were much better 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.200
 however, when the pages are there, yes 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.090
 he hears a strange noise we can say 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.310
 that were they are pages but they are those 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.090
 call signs with collect sign 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.480
 and so on anyway guys apologize for 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.060
 voice but I'm terribly cooled 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.340
 so much for a change anyway I have you 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.860
 shown by many to this day that is 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.290
 and now I'd like to go out and show you the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.900
 familiarity that is that have a night 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.209
 vision that is nothing that makes the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.120
 night morality we do it in the of 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.460
 city ​​and gods really really made it 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.170
 very well 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.580
 I wanted to come here we have a torch there 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.280
 we can turn on you can't see anymore 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.020
 nothing and turn off the torch really 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.120
 boys and I was sorry 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.170
 pleasantly surprised by this trend 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.330
 because it's great I really hope that 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.510
 you can appreciate this video is who 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.270
 has an iphone who has an iphone or ipad 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.850
 why not download it as it should be said 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.970
 at many times you practically focus 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.490
 camcorder thanks upstream of the night is 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.340
 practically identical to those for the 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.820
 computer in my opinion also falck amelio 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.180
 certainly on the computer we are in 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.250
 forest in which we are in a city 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.250
 you see the cars as they are made 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.840
 well then score really fluid as a game 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.300
 come come this sound there is 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.170
 feeling maybe street sound this wants 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.650
 to say that it is close decreases a page 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.930
 those do he go near the only ones 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.530
 there is a page this strange feels 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.560
 sound 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.490
 now I'm not finding this page 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.490
 a peace unit where the heck 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:48.009
 that 's the night slider in the slam between 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.379
 the other is shitting under this much 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.909
 zero boys game at times when 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:57.809
 you really really get scared too 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.809
 worse than the computer 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.529
 keep hearing this noise in 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.009
 the background is just the distance 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:07.929
 page 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.449
 anyway, I don't want to be happy 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:13.629
 stop me they are Campoli because they do it 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.639
 in short, a video camera is not 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.240
 however eco fabio found a page of 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.319
 we pay the lives and transfer the exhibition 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.539
 the window of a page in the boys I 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.150
 I tell him that my son ends 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.670
 council 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.030
 this perfect aspect why not 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.030
 I played 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.480
 the boys and not even on purpose 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.880
 close make us fucked so nothing 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.370
 I showed you this slider that is me 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.810
 really enjoyed it 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.460
 let me know what you think of it 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.620
 this slam lost life is proven if 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.480
 you want to try it, I invite you to try it 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.250
 because really well done 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.710
 having said this as I always say snow video 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.260
 let a nice I like a commentary is 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.830
 as always from wrap torino and all this a 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.830
