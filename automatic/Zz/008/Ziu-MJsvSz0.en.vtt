level 26 or 27 30 and it levels go up to
I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.110> 50<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> pick<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.299> those

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
I think 50 but if you pick one of those

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.139 
I think 50 but if you pick one of those
then<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.259> gonna<00:02:01.500> mod<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.640> character<00:02:03.000> that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.420 

actually<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.549> don't<00:03:02.849> suggest<00:03:03.540> well<00:03:04.260> don't<00:03:05.219> max

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
actually I don't suggest well don't max

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.830 
actually I don't suggest well don't max
out<00:03:05.609> your<00:03:05.639> med<00:03:05.909> kits<00:03:06.180> because<00:03:06.599> then<00:03:06.750> it'll

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
out your med kits because then it'll

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.459 
out your med kits because then it'll
take<00:03:07.079> up<00:03:07.260> all<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:08.219> space<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:10.290> your

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
take up all of your space in your

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.470 
take up all of your space in your
inventory<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:11.219> I<00:03:11.819> think<00:03:12.120> you're<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.329> have

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
inventory so I think you're gonna have

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.000 
inventory so I think you're gonna have
10<00:03:14.780> 10<00:03:15.780> per<00:03:16.079> slot<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.949> say<00:03:17.129> if<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.280> have<00:03:17.370> 14<00:03:19.010> 14

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
10 10 per slot so say if you have 14 14

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.490 
10 10 per slot so say if you have 14 14
free<00:03:20.549> empty<00:03:21.060> inventory<00:03:21.599> spaces<00:03:22.229> you<00:03:22.349> could

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
free empty inventory spaces you could

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.670 
free empty inventory spaces you could
have<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.739> total<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.879> think<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:24.900> 140<00:03:25.729> medkits

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
have a total of I think is 140 medkits

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.909 
have a total of I think is 140 medkits
money<00:03:28.680> ways<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:31.049> can<00:03:31.169> enter<00:03:31.199> custom<00:03:31.799> number
