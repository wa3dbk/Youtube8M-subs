00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.870
 and race 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:22.080
 the staff of the team spoke Olhanense 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 minda heat of the day advanced wars party 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.390
 here to make my first battle 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.029
 In the game you know that I always 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.899
 I showed all game modes call of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.630
 such as the gang xix 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.879
 however the critics a brawn more 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.090
 simple here my character that has 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.789
 an incredible super symbol made by me 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 but it is a simple taste and we are going 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.739
 expel now it 's ok we here 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.680
 This is the first day of battle they have 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.110
 prices at level 45 boot that way this 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.539
 rock and roll and is not in any 50 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.640
 way this is going to be a great game you 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.920
 I want to leave the application 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.559
 felt can not buy the super game 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 cheap is a partnership that has as far 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 You can use my code and buy it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.450
 Cheapest price ever and can play 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.670
 where is this map? 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 the government wants to win because the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.240
 first is the first time I go 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.310
 play but start talking you can use the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 code the hidden data and in this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 now the cheapest price in the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.330
 market you can see it does not exist anymore 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.880
 cheap and one thousand euros bpi if you can 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.600
 play online for example the pirate version 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.700
 everything we already used to some clear game is you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.100
 can not play online just this great 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 difference will be going of discretion I 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.630
 I'm ready 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:54.030
 Only it's already done my class. 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 I was not coming in, I do not know 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.759
 who plays is we can think that a fan 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.969
 that is whenever we get feedback 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.390
 someone who just from hilton hotels play 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.349
 Live ie the brother it was personal 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.170
 It's really up to us to win there. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:20.379
 answer - 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:22.000
 Okay, it 's not the first one here, okay. Okay. 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:28.810
 let's keep our first person 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.420
 so compared to ok we have a pill 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.829
 rock and death 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.480
 I do not know why, but it 's natural. 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.129
 when he met the character's mother 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:51.250
 maybe the sensitivity 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:52.180
 'm sorry already started years together I 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.540
 I'm lazy 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:02.200
 so why not do anything 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.019
 wow ok great is great that we do not 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.470
 we got the grenade and things like that 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:12.599
 even sit here continue walking 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.599
 It was not good at all. 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.170
 OK 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.359
 calm not only buy our mine 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.889
 quickly I still do not know how well 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.780
 use these things I'll have to 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:31.440
 I'd say it's okay, I 'd say 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.470
 I'll have to use it, but it's easy. 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:42.910
 quickly this this our pec watch 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:45.599
 I think if we lawyers and what not 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.599
 not 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.280
 and hence we do not fall into the rankings 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.380
 Then I do not know why. 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.670
 Do not you get my character Dora ? 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:08.850
 I want 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:10.500
 ours to portugal someone behind us 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.240
 We are and I could not become like myself. 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.870
 I wanted to go the other way to try 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:24.150
 to the maximum not die more 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:31.500
 fast and died, however, or anything 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:32.430
 incredible started there badly at school 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.850
 negative 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.150
 it never happened before she's like this 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:54.090
 I was always waiting for a position 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:56.190
 better take someone calm and calm not 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.830
 have capital this perhaps nobody from the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:09.690
 game do things like this things 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:18.590
 different from normal until at last the 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:22.250
 time in these fields must be equal to 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.250
 my face 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.180
 Okay, I'm not ashamed in the face. 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.500
 Ok I joined a grenade and he goes 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.830

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:39.530
 I did not say ah ok I founded fumbel 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.980
 He jumped to say that I was for 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.980
 their communities 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.720
 OK 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:06:00.230
 and it's good okay're inside another view 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:02.600
 the staff for now breathe a little 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.360
 better breathe to get the little bird 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:13.070
 vital 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:16.960
 Okay, I did not do it and we're here. 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:20.150
 Up now is the back tried 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.550

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.130
 and I tolerate an audience breathing more 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.840
 breathe is good I love breathing of life 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.520
 It's ok, it 's okay, no one, I'll get home. 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.570
 I only apologize for my 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.910
 call of duty unit skills 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.190
 to try not to die 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.900
 looking everywhere I do not have 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:07:01.150
