00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
my hair's been at these twists for

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.240 
my hair's been at these twists for
exactly<00:00:02.879> nine<00:00:03.240> weeks<00:00:03.540> now<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.049> while<00:00:05.040> it's

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
exactly nine weeks now and while it's

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.240 
exactly nine weeks now and while it's
grown<00:00:05.490> well<00:00:05.700> especially<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:07.200> almost<00:00:07.830> daily

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
grown well especially with almost daily

stimulator<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:12.150> ends<00:00:12.540> look<00:00:12.809> very<00:00:13.110> weak<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
stimulator the ends look very weak so

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.750 
stimulator the ends look very weak so
when<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> unbraided<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.440> decided<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
when I unbraided it I decided to do a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.300 
when I unbraided it I decided to do a
hot<00:00:18.119> oil<00:00:18.510> treatment<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.710> would<00:00:19.859> strengthen

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
hot oil treatment that would strengthen

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.120 
hot oil treatment that would strengthen
the<00:00:20.760> ends<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.420> reduces<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.590> reduce<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the ends and reduces and reduce the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.830 
the ends and reduces and reduce the
chances<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> getting<00:00:23.850> split<00:00:24.359> ends<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
chances of getting split ends and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.290 
chances of getting split ends and
breakage<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> very<00:00:26.519> simple<00:00:26.910> hot<00:00:27.090> oil

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
breakage this is a very simple hot oil

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.450 
breakage this is a very simple hot oil
treatment<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.680> unlike<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> hot<00:00:29.310> oil

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
treatment and it's unlike the hot oil

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.569 
treatment and it's unlike the hot oil
treatment<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.060> showed<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.420> before<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:31.470> is

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
treatment I showed you before which is

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
treatment I showed you before which is
also<00:00:32.579> good<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.880> fortifying<00:00:33.360> hair<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
also good for fortifying hair but is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
also good for fortifying hair but is
especially<00:00:34.559> good<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.309> hair<00:00:35.790> growth

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
especially good for hair growth

especially good for hair growth
stimulation<00:00:37.040> this<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> need<00:00:38.780> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
this was diluted it ended up being about

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.760 
this was diluted it ended up being about
30<00:00:47.129> mils<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.809> quite<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.620> your

30 mils which is quite a lot if your

30 mils which is quite a lot if your
