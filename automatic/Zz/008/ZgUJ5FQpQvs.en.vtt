 10 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.089
 it's a pride in the seventh week 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.039
 the mark of trust on behalf of m 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.070
 to me 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.360
 say 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.720
 that shows it's great that we value what I have been doing at the club since my arrival 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 at 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.670
 cla 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.870
 at 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.530
 on the contrary 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.200
 the three representatives in the points a relay to fly to the coach this

 previous seasons the brio 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 and that's for sure 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.120
 in e2 texas are an example at rest 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.530
 for all the captains years 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.000
 at the level of the rigor of the seriousness of the work 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.229
 and here they are, I've judged a lot more loaded and I'm doing a lot of server 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.770
 it's exasperation the goal 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 I do not see in ek the captaincy is surely 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.240
 given the examples to show rigor in the investigations on one is and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.040
 from the south rallied all the while all the membership for the same purpose and 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.929
 it is true that good the Bordeaux since 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.219
 for three years I i think that playing games like fashion 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.960
 champions league 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 it makes me progress I want 10% and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.570
 10 the capitanat mahamat may be allowed to further express myself with but 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.850
 my colleagues 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 that's why 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 you take it 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.939
 it is important to 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.579
 they showed examples in all circumstances and for 100 th 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.969
 I want to say 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.640
 he has to try to gather everyone tries to debes 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.640
 the degree the pull the group up and 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.199

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.939
 no 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.259
 I think competitor% 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.919
 e to illuminate it next 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.689
 for 100 euros recapitalize city is sometimes for presenting 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.059
 he was happy 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:02.189
 it's true that yes maybe that but percent 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.760
 he predicts a little more pressure but good for a hundred and more 10% 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.579
 it takes time for character to have to know fraud 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 passionate a place 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.209
 why have I created things to correct I I'm speaking as 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.389
 some do it because my the water captain was there could 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.439
 be 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.549
 the company had only 3 2 3 kg years of experience in pro 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.539
 proving to me the link 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.289

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.819
 try to arrange 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.939
 Allah 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.409
 super nintendo of the captain over the next 24 months who 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.149
 its partners and 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.010

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.739
 good I do not think so I think 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.270
 this figure is something about it 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.309
 and that's how the character 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.309
 having had to assume
