00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that sort of thing

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.400 
that sort of thing
also<00:00:32.880> again<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> unique<00:00:33.719> thing<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:33.960> this

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
also again the unique thing about this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
also again the unique thing about this
metal<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.430> machine<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> made<00:00:35.969> from

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
metal that this machine is made from

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.600 
metal that this machine is made from
instead<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> being<00:00:37.680> made<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.160> standard

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
instead of being made from a standard

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
instead of being made from a standard
grade<00:00:38.850> metal<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.450> an<00:00:39.540> aluminum<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.290> made

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
grade metal or an aluminum it's made

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.889 
grade metal or an aluminum it's made
from<00:00:40.739> magnesium<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> again<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.660> lighter

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
from magnesium so again it's lighter

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.080 
from magnesium so again it's lighter
than<00:00:43.140> aluminum<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.370> probably<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
than aluminum but it's it's probably a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.690 
than aluminum but it's it's probably a
little<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.390> stronger<00:00:45.780> than<00:00:45.989> steel<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> let's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
little bit stronger than steel so let's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.490 
little bit stronger than steel so let's
go<00:00:47.789> ahead<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.149> come<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> presser
