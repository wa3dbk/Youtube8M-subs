about the existence of anger which is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.900 
about the existence of anger which is
like<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> fervor<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.289> creature<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.640> now<00:00:26.789> they

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
like a fervor but a creature so now they

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
like a fervor but a creature so now they
are<00:00:27.029> both<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.420> deck<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.779> took<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.109> Shaku

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
are both in the deck I took out Shaku

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.669 
are both in the deck I took out Shaku
and<00:00:28.830> bringer<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.650> avatar<00:00:31.650> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679

destroy<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.950> thing<00:00:35.219> effects<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.960> creatures

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.860 
destroy your thing effects on creatures
and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.800> think<00:00:40.800> her<00:00:41.270> three-day<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> major<00:00:42.629> turn

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and I think her three-day a major turn

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.610 
and I think her three-day a major turn
thing<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.129> yourself<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:46.410> difficult

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
thing to yourself was a little difficult

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.959 
thing to yourself was a little difficult
when<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.129> trying<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.550> things<00:00:47.850> like

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
when I'm trying to use things like

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.029 
when I'm trying to use things like
slaughter<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.739> there's<00:00:49.890> something

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
slaughter and I think there's something

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
slaughter and I think there's something
else<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.879> cost<00:00:51.120> me<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> bunch<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
else in here that cost me a bunch of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.790 
else in here that cost me a bunch of
life<00:00:51.690> ashes<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.289> ashes<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.829> whatnot<00:00:53.960> um<00:00:54.960> what

it's<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.600> restriction<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> stack<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it's the restriction on the stack that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's the restriction on the stack that
makes<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.070> pretty<00:01:50.220> sweet<00:01:50.579> although<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:52.259> know

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
makes it pretty sweet although you know

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100 
makes it pretty sweet although you know
I<00:01:52.409> wouldn't<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.220> opposed<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.509> building<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
I wouldn't be opposed to building a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
I wouldn't be opposed to building a
different<00:01:55.470> deck<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.799> newer<00:01:55.950> cars<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
different deck with newer cars just to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.310 
different deck with newer cars just to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
see how good the deck could be although

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
see how good the deck could be although
