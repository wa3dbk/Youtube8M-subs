00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
this is it basically just a launcher and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.890 
this is it basically just a launcher and
it<00:00:08.550> has<00:00:08.670> all<00:00:08.910> these<00:00:09.030> different<00:00:09.450> mod<00:00:09.599> packs

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
it has all these different mod packs

it has all these different mod packs
they're<00:00:10.260> all<00:00:10.530> listed<00:00:10.740> here<00:00:10.950> there<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.910> also

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
they're all listed here there is also

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.350 
they're all listed here there is also
the<00:00:12.509> box<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.190> something<00:00:15.150> like

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the box I think it is something like

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.910 
the box I think it is something like
that<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> there's<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.379> other<00:00:16.529> ones<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:16.890> well

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
that and there's some other ones as well

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.700 
that and there's some other ones as well
but<00:00:17.550> basically<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.720> really<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.560> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
but basically this is really as in to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.390 
but basically this is really as in to
install<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:21.240> usually<00:00:22.080> will<00:00:22.619> work<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.100> any

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
install and it usually will work on any

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160 
install and it usually will work on any
update<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> later<00:00:25.050> update

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
update so if you're on a later update

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230 
update so if you're on a later update
and<00:00:25.710> you're<00:00:25.830> watching<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.189> video<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:27.060> will

and you're watching this video it will

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.339 
and you're watching this video it will
most<00:00:27.510> likely<00:00:27.630> work<00:00:28.230> unless<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.519> whole

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
most likely work unless the like whole

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.350

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
most browsers it just pops up somewhere

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
most browsers it just pops up somewhere
but<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> drag<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> your

and it's not on the latest update that
is<00:02:32.760> fine<00:02:33.030> guys<00:02:33.300> nothing<00:02:34.020> went<00:02:34.200> wrong<00:02:34.410> it's

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
is fine guys nothing went wrong it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.100 
is fine guys nothing went wrong it's
just<00:02:35.070> because<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.300> mods<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.930> might

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
just because all the mods in it might

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.770 
just because all the mods in it might
not<00:02:37.440> been<00:02:37.620> updated<00:02:38.000> therefore<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.300> needs<00:02:39.330> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
not been updated therefore it needs to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.990 
not been updated therefore it needs to
be<00:02:40.770> on<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.950> lower<00:02:41.160> update<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.790> all<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.330> work

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
be on a lower update so all of them work

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.940 
be on a lower update so all of them work
so<00:02:44.750> once<00:02:44.960> it's<00:02:45.140> done<00:02:45.290> should<00:02:45.620> come<00:02:45.800> up<00:02:45.890> with
