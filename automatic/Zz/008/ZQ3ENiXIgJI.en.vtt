00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.730
 hello everyone to all and morgane so we 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
 meet up to talk about one of the infos 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.959
 important of last night's whitbread 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.550
 apart from the fact that the iron banner 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.230
 come back this Tuesday and you're going 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.890
 finally be able to acquire the helmet that 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.210
 It's awesome 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.130
 so I make you a dedicated video 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.990
 on how to do on how well 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.190
 started this last one to do but one 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.730
 not going to dwell on it in this 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.500
 video 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.850
 so I apologize to some on 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.130
 facebook and flood was already in 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.050
 place no no you need an update 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.370
 for things to change and so 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.020
 this possibility is the possibility 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.819
 to simply dismantle lodges 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.649
 against reputation two factions 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:40.940
 so I find it rather the new year 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.350
 in the same state of mind as the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.260
 material changes we were left 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.789
 varied opportunities to use our 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.440
 resources finally and not 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.899
 necessarily use them for 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.100
 the main use especially for 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.389
 the big players and who have a lot 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.399
 hours of play and so have a lot 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.600
 for example of these praises and they go 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.210
 so be able to increase more quickly 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.069
 their factions and acquire a package that 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.129
 which will probably please them more 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:05.180
 to note besides what do I say did 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.620
 a post 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.420
 today the community manager 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.710
 two buggies actually evoking the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.960
 community requests that were 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340
 the most recurrent and among these 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.990
 requests that are requests that are going 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.030
 to be treated seriously with you 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.829
 really linger there so we have the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 possibility to transmit eefje these 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.070
 objects go euro players 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.229
 know well wise diablo players 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.539
 also which is therefore to give 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.740
 the appearance of an item another item 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.450
 do for example that your life this 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.920
 icebreaker and the head of a stoic if 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.780
 you prefer the historical visual 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.399
 I do not hope also in the points 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.740
 recurring community we have the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.490
 private matches in trial of course huh 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.259
 it's something that I 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.450
 I would appreciate a lot too 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.689
 Skins on weapons and hair 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.770
 facial on your characters 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.880
 knowing that would mean he 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.409
 would see who are putting back any 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.329
 something that can re customize its 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.159
 because we're not going to recreate a 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.450
 personal and their motorcycles level 20 just 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.390
 to be able to put a mustache on him 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.929
 a beard but all its gold aspects off 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.439
 hardship 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.109
 except pvp are purely aspects 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.460
 rpg purely mmo so why not this 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.880
 would be nice it would give a little bit 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.679
 plus this aspect there to the destiny game that in 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.350
 missing a little bit of course they get 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.380
 seek them at the border with the fps 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.210
 the mmo so that's so I hope that 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.650
 this little info video will have pleased you 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.150
 as always I try to give you 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.550
 all the info as soon as they are there 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.620
 so it was last night 7 weekly update 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.940
 please go see on bonnie 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.410
 point morning you can go see that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.880
 by yourself as soon as it comes out hesitate 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.710
 not to follow this page simply 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.490
 and I find very quickly on the chain 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.490
 and on the stream
