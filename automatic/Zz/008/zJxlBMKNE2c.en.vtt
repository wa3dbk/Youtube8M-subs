00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.460 
at 30 psi I'm racing around 34 so this
one<00:03:42.430> reads<00:03:42.640> up<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.000> 45<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:44.200> far<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:44.440> been

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
one reads up to 45 so far it's been

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.780 
one reads up to 45 so far it's been
pretty<00:03:44.710> good<00:03:45.240> cheap<00:03:46.240> in<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.480> works<00:03:47.790> upgrade

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
pretty good cheap in the works upgrade

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.700 
pretty good cheap in the works upgrade
the<00:03:48.910> seats<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:50.050> Recaro<00:03:50.580> SPG<00:03:51.580> bucket<00:03:51.880> seats

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
the seats to Recaro SPG bucket seats

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.860 
the seats to Recaro SPG bucket seats
much<00:03:53.710> lighter<00:03:54.010> than<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.460> stock<00:03:54.670> ones<00:03:57.870> you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
much lighter than the stock ones you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.110 
much lighter than the stock ones you
know<00:03:58.990> how<00:03:59.170> to<00:04:00.090> put<00:04:01.090> some<00:04:01.270> resistors

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.220 

so<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.110> lights<00:04:05.319> won't<00:04:05.530> come<00:04:05.650> on

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:53.129 

I<00:04:31.169> mean<00:04:48.510> holding<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:50.680> is<00:04:50.830> an<00:04:50.949> M<00:04:51.039> R<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:52.139> that's

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
I mean holding this is an M R so that's

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.029 
I mean holding this is an M R so that's
dope<00:04:53.500> lunches

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
dope lunches

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:02.910 
dope lunches
still<00:04:54.280> holding<00:04:54.490> pretty<00:04:54.699> good<00:04:59.910> room
