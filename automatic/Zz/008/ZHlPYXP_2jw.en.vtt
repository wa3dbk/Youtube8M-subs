cricket now has a bunch of stats and
abilities<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:24.449> means<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:25.439> more

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
abilities which means that a lot more

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.429 
abilities which means that a lot more
variety<00:00:26.189> comes<00:00:26.400> down<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> pitch<00:00:27.170> I've<00:00:28.170> just

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
variety comes down the pitch I've just

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.320 
variety comes down the pitch I've just
size<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.949> when<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> pretty<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.029> played

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
size that when I pretty well and played

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.709 
size that when I pretty well and played
a<00:00:30.359> cover<00:00:30.599> drive<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> am<00:00:32.279> tapping<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
a cover drive and now I am tapping to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.200 
a cover drive and now I am tapping to
control<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.230> runners<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.649> make<00:00:34.800> them<00:00:34.980> go<00:00:35.210> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
control my runners and make them go I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
control my runners and make them go I
have<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.930> got<00:00:37.140> lucky<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:38.070> I've

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
have just got lucky there because I've

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.860 
have just got lucky there because I've
overthrown<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.510> always<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
overthrown and there's always a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.389 
overthrown and there's always a
temptation<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.530> try<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> squeeze<00:00:41.160> another

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
temptation to try and squeeze another

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.619 
temptation to try and squeeze another
wing<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> never<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.300> when<00:00:42.510> they'll

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
wing because you never know when they'll

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.250 
wing because you never know when they'll
mess<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:44.180> six<00:00:45.180> runs<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.690> quite<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> haul

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
mess it up six runs that's quite a haul

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.440 
mess it up six runs that's quite a haul
I'll<00:00:46.500> take<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.920> let's<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I'll take it let's see if I can do that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
I'll take it let's see if I can do that
again<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.129> same<00:00:50.820> shot

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
again and you can see same shot

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
again and you can see same shot
different<00:00:51.570> results<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.260> about<00:00:52.590> timing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
different results it's all about timing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
different results it's all about timing
ball<00:00:53.579> position<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.180> slop<00:00:54.480> shot<00:00:54.719> selection

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
ball position and slop shot selection

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.010 
ball position and slop shot selection
our<00:00:56.070> physics<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.760> quite<00:00:57.030> advanced<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
our physics are quite advanced so it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
our physics are quite advanced so it
takes<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> bit<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.620> finesse<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.280> able<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> get

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
takes a bit of finesse to be able to get

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.790 
takes a bit of finesse to be able to get
boundary<00:01:00.030> after<00:01:00.329> boundary<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.500> I've

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
boundary after boundary right here I've

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.820 
boundary after boundary right here I've
tried<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.190> tried<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.850> okay<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.480> great

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
tried and tried so okay it's not great

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.170 
tried and tried so okay it's not great
I'll<00:01:04.830> sit<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.189> wait<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> next<00:01:05.790> one

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I'll sit and wait for the next one

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
I'll sit and wait for the next one
I'll<00:01:06.630> check<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.140> field<00:01:07.439> make<00:01:08.100> sure<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.580> I've

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
I'll check the field make sure that I've

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
I'll check the field make sure that I've
got<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.939> strategy<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> gaps

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
got my strategy right and know the gaps

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
got my strategy right and know the gaps
up<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:12.320> that<00:01:13.320> drives<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:13.979> better<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.820> with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
up and that drives a bit better but with

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.200 
up and that drives a bit better but with
where's<00:01:15.540> results<00:01:16.759> after<00:01:17.759> looking<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
where's results after looking at the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
where's results after looking at the
field<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> looking<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> delivery<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
field and looking at the delivery I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
field and looking at the delivery I
think<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> drive<00:01:20.460> still<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
think the drive still the way to go and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.980 
think the drive still the way to go and
that<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.590> better<00:01:22.880> it's<00:01:23.880> amazing<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that one is much better it's amazing the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
that one is much better it's amazing the
difference<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.619> makes<00:01:25.890> getting<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> timing

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
difference it makes getting the timing

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.749 
difference it makes getting the timing
and<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> ball<00:01:27.299> position<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
and the ball position just right and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
and the ball position just right and
this<00:01:29.759> cover<00:01:30.090> drive<00:01:30.390> shows<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.930> again<00:01:31.170> after

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
this cover drive shows it again after

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
this cover drive shows it again after
the<00:01:31.710> fairly<00:01:32.340> weak<00:01:32.549> once<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.000> started<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.570> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the fairly weak once I started with I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450 
the fairly weak once I started with I
think<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.560> getting<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> roll<00:01:35.040> which

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
think I'm just getting on a roll which

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.679 
think I'm just getting on a roll which
is<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> pity<00:01:35.909> because<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> end<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is a pity because it's the end of the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.039 
is a pity because it's the end of the
innings<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.220> good<00:01:38.490> score<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
innings but it's a good score and I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.480 
innings but it's a good score and I
should<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> able<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> defend<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
should be able to defend it in the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420 
should be able to defend it in the
bowling<00:01:42.290> first<00:01:43.290> stage<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.860> bowling<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
bowling first stage of bowling is

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
bowling first stage of bowling is
choosing<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> bowler<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.259> mixed

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
choosing a bowler I'm going for mixed

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you're going in real-time as the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.800 
you're going in real-time as the
indicator<00:02:07.229> needles<00:02:07.770> move<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:09.539> one

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
indicator needles move and this one

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.750 
indicator needles move and this one
gesture<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.860> make<00:02:11.160> down<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> flight

gesture that you make down the flight

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
gesture that you make down the flight
path<00:02:12.030> controls<00:02:12.569> every<00:02:12.900> aspect<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
path controls every aspect of the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
path controls every aspect of the
delivery<00:02:13.980> you'll<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.760> here<00:02:15.030> when<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> drag

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
delivery you'll see here when I drag

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.119 
delivery you'll see here when I drag
down<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.989> right<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.410> pulls<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.920> line

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
down to the right it pulls the line

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.979 
down to the right it pulls the line
right<00:02:17.580> off<00:02:17.610> course<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.209> right<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.780> kills

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
right off course the right and it kills

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.670 
right off course the right and it kills
my<00:02:19.170> accuracy<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.540> am<00:02:21.540> probably<00:02:21.989> getting<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.650> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
my accuracy I am probably getting what I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.170 
my accuracy I am probably getting what I
deserve<00:02:22.770> for<00:02:23.160> these<00:02:23.459> deliveries<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
deserve for these deliveries at the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.479 
deserve for these deliveries at the
moment<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.470> I'll<00:02:25.770> take<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:26.310> strategic

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
moment so I'll take a more strategic

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.259 
moment so I'll take a more strategic
approach<00:02:27.030> I'll<00:02:27.989> check<00:02:28.680> my<00:02:28.890> field<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.640> choose

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
approach I'll check my field and choose

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.030 
approach I'll check my field and choose
something<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.870> little<00:02:31.140> more<00:02:31.170> attacking<00:02:34.040> then

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
something a little more attacking then

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.619 
something a little more attacking then
I'll<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> good<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.239> about<00:02:36.330> my

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
I'll have a good think about my

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.720 
I'll have a good think about my
deliveries<00:02:37.140> flick<00:02:37.800> through<00:02:37.980> them<00:02:38.280> see<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
deliveries flick through them see the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
deliveries flick through them see the
previews<00:02:39.180> play<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.690> screen<00:02:40.050> before<00:02:40.620> I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
previews play out on the screen before I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.449 
previews play out on the screen before I
select<00:02:41.310> something<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.129> batter's

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
select something just like the batter's

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.610 
select something just like the batter's
the<00:02:44.640> ball<00:02:44.819> at<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.660> range<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.349> stats

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
the ball at all have a range of stats

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.220 
the ball at all have a range of stats
and<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.370> well<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.610> go<00:02:47.849> if<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.120> gesture<00:02:48.660> feeds

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and how well I go if the gesture feeds

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.589 
and how well I go if the gesture feeds
into<00:02:49.830> those<00:02:50.340> stats<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.879> determine<00:02:51.390> how

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
into those stats to determine how

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.470 
into those stats to determine how
accurate<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> delivery<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.950> at<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.269> moment

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
accurate the delivery is at the moment

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.559 
accurate the delivery is at the moment
I'm<00:02:54.720> bowling<00:02:55.200> slow<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.129> off<00:02:56.459> target<00:02:57.000> which<00:02:57.540> is

pretty safe for the batters I should try

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.920 
pretty safe for the batters I should try
