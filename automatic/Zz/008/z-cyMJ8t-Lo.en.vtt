while searching the map and battling if

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.089 
while searching the map and battling if
we<00:03:02.239> made<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.540> robots<00:03:02.930> larger<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.680> map<00:03:03.920> would

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
we made the robots larger the map would

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.449 
we made the robots larger the map would
also<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.209> be<00:03:05.660> larger<00:03:06.230> which<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.860> not<00:03:07.069> just

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
also have to be larger which is not just

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.039 
also have to be larger which is not just
a<00:03:07.549> problem<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.180> games<00:03:08.360> overall<00:03:08.750> budget

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
a problem of the games overall budget

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.860 
a problem of the games overall budget
but<00:03:09.739> also<00:03:09.920> searching<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.880> map<00:03:11.090> would<00:03:11.390> take<00:03:11.690> an

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
but also searching the map would take an

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.979 
but also searching the map would take an
overly<00:03:12.290> long<00:03:12.440> time<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.099> human<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:14.120> been<00:03:14.420> 15

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
overly long time as a human it's been 15

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.600 
overly long time as a human it's been 15
years<00:03:15.019> since<00:03:15.290> smallest<00:03:15.829> soft<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.220> founded
