to build a wood burning gas generator if

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.880 
to build a wood burning gas generator if
you<00:00:14.790> think<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.389> making<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.379> present

Jared Patterson a Pitt State student who
actually<00:00:20.340> built<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.210> contraption<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:22.529> his

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
actually built this contraption for his

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.340 
actually built this contraption for his
course<00:00:23.220> project<00:00:24.029> when<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> first<00:00:24.810> look<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
course project when you first look at it

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.130 
course project when you first look at it
it's<00:00:25.500> kind<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.800> intimidating<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it's kind of intimidating and it was to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's kind of intimidating and it was to
me<00:00:28.260> too<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.730> when<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> first<00:00:29.849> saw<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.390> didn't

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
me too I when I first saw it I didn't

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
me too I when I first saw it I didn't
know<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.869> was<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.099> only<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
know what it was and that was only a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.290 
know what it was and that was only a
couple<00:00:32.430> months<00:00:32.759> ago

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
couple months ago

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080 
couple months ago
it<00:00:33.600> basically<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.469> takes<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.340> energy<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
it basically just takes the energy that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.049 
it basically just takes the energy that
is<00:00:36.510> trapped<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.020> wood<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:38.340> convert<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
is trapped in wood and we convert it to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.200 
is trapped in wood and we convert it to
a<00:00:39.270> gas<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.040> burning<00:00:41.040> an<00:00:41.190> engine<00:00:41.610> sounds

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
a gas and burning an engine sounds

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
a gas and burning an engine sounds
simple<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> idea<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.010> presented

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
simple right well the idea was presented

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
simple right well the idea was presented
in<00:00:44.610> Scott<00:00:44.969> Norman's<00:00:45.420> fuels<00:00:45.899> combustion<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think that that's probably the best

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.459 
think that that's probably the best
thing<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.620> any<00:00:56.629> college<00:00:57.629> instructor<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> be

able to see a student excel at something

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.410 
able to see a student excel at something
beyond<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:02.100> expectations<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.180> take
