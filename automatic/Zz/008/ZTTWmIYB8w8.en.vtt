00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.379
 well here he saw the episode of 'el chavo del 8' where the guy became the 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.470
 dead because he pretended to be run over and everyone got sad 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.610
 remember that after that episode began to pass trouble episodes 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.099
 repeated 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.329
 It turns out that after the DVD came out with the episodes, it passed itself off as 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:22.269
 an error the fact that that episode was 143 but the previous episode is 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.300
 marked as 141 however the date between which those episodes were signed 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.960
 was when the producers and the actors took a break of four months and 

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:35.850
 the programs broadcast repeated episodes the lost episode 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.860
 the 142 of the guy from 8 was a supposed counting error the ancients said 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.180
 producers in televisa but what really happened is that they signed a 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.280
 alternate episode to the death of the guy from 8 where the consequence of the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.740
 mischief of the guy resulted in that he ended up run over really was a 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.660
 strange episode began with the popular song of the beginning but the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.970
 audio was somewhat out of phase about five seconds and left a strange silence 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.450
 as static for the remaining five seconds after which 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.920
 the song ended 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.110
 the episode began normal with a normal view of the neighborhood but 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.610
 no weight 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.130
 character entered the scene however the camera changed its focus towards 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.740
 doors as if a character would come out but did not come out 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.149
 the process was repeated with all the cameras strangely you hear the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.420
 murmur whenever the camera does not come to the house of Don ramÃ³n but not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 you suddenly understand you heard the sound of hurried footsteps and enter 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.230
 the guy from eight on stage but there seems to be no focus on him 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.870
 the doors are still focused non-stop and the chago only seems to be 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.220
 doing something near the laundry and the barrel the recorded laughter begin to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.909
 sound for no reason when the guy left the shipment
