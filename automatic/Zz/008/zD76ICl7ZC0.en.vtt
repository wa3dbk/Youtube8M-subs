dlc coating that has gone through a
stone<00:01:26.640> wash<00:01:26.820> process<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.899> normal<00:01:28.530> finish

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
stone wash process now the normal finish

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.340 
stone wash process now the normal finish
of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.610> skyline<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> bead<00:01:30.750> blast<00:01:31.020> finish

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
of the skyline is a bead blast finish

of the skyline is a bead blast finish
but<00:01:32.780> you'll<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.429> very

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
but you'll see that this is very

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.290 
but you'll see that this is very
different<00:01:36.330> from<00:01:37.080> most<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.920> other

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
different from most of the other

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.340 
different from most of the other
variations<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> skyline<00:01:39.899> that<00:01:40.080> have<00:01:40.200> yet

variations of the skyline that have yet

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
variations of the skyline that have yet
to<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.670> matches<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.119> very

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
to come out now it matches up very

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.499 
to come out now it matches up very
nicely<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> black<00:01:43.410> g10<00:01:43.679> here<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:44.509> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
nicely with the black g10 here and it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
nicely with the black g10 here and it
has<00:01:45.780> been<00:01:45.959> said<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.319> this<00:01:46.679> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.069> gives<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
has been said that this kind of gives it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.059 
has been said that this kind of gives it
a<00:01:47.429> pre<00:01:47.729> worn<00:01:48.060> pocket<00:01:48.810> worn<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.500> look<00:01:49.770> and

a pre worn pocket worn kind of look and
a<00:01:51.030> good<00:01:51.330> thing<00:01:51.600> about<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.319> that<00:01:52.350> despite

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
a good thing about that is that despite

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.680 
a good thing about that is that despite
any<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:53.940> you<00:01:54.179> would<00:01:54.420> put<00:01:54.630> on
