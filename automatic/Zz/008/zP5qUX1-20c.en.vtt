00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think if I could see my wheels are more

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.550 
think if I could see my wheels are more
confident<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.060> can't<00:01:27.329> see<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.509> wheels<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
confident I can't see my wheels be so

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.020 
confident I can't see my wheels be so
good<00:01:28.740> that's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.759> interesting

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
good that's a really interesting

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.639 
good that's a really interesting
perspective<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.619> know

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
perspective because that's you know

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:32.990 
perspective because that's you know
that's<00:01:31.860> quite<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> juxtaposition<00:01:32.280> isn't<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that's quite a juxtaposition isn't it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780 
that's quite a juxtaposition isn't it
you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.710> be<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.799> magnanimous<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> say

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you know to be as magnanimous as you say

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.280 
you know to be as magnanimous as you say
him<00:01:35.939> being<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:36.270> hopeless<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> lot

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
him being so hopeless in that's a lot

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.870 
him being so hopeless in that's a lot
road<00:01:37.439> racing<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:37.920> yet<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.790> an

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629 
to the longevity of the of the formula

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.899 
to the longevity of the of the formula
because<00:05:11.929> it<00:05:12.079> is<00:05:12.289> in<00:05:12.889> such<00:05:13.339> good<00:05:13.849> health<00:05:14.029> I

the<00:05:23.479> good<00:05:23.599> of<00:05:23.659> the<00:05:23.779> formula<00:05:25.059> but<00:05:26.059> I<00:05:27.069> think<00:05:28.069> if

00:05:29.049 --> 00:05:29.059 
the good of the formula but I think if

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.399 
the good of the formula but I think if
