00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.370
 the asking trade is not worth to 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.830
 Who has seen my lecture who already 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.630
 watched here ok 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.839
 If someone could tell me what the 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.610
 largest discovery of 1876 this year was 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.440
 created a product that is between us until 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.180
 today, what more prophetic thing 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.880
 anyone has idea 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.920
 I think we invents new people right 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.420
 new people by competitive that the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 person what if you do not know there 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.310
 so thats how i go french your ipad 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.860
 so ahead I have you have an ipad 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.720
 and a Malaysian started much further ahead 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.820
 so it 's unique because people 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.040
 Buy these light made me go get the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.660
 neuromarketing because I said that to 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.730
 presentation of the mixture of my word 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.010
 for this renewal but we've already seen 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.360
 already has become a commodity and almost 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.700
 We do not have to do things impossible. 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.170
 unimaginable to sell only that there are 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.240
 several companies already doing things 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.800
 unimaginable people are not thousand 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.390
 things go in your head today 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.030
 all consumers think first 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.010
 12 deaths in which you have to 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.390
 change the perception that moment 10 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.370
 even bringing your own 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.020
 product has to ensure that the timing of 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.580
 truth be positive and the people 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.250
 creating a list rather than simply 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.080
 Buy the word on google then like 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.100
 companies are doing to call the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.840
 people's attention 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.690
 I entered very large company website 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 So I see who alone where we are 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.950
 our mission our vision our values 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.550
 x that x who buys mission and value 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.450
 because 95% of these purchases are 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.159
 unconscious then taking in 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.710
 there is a business 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.810
 neuromarketing do not know if bruno has arrived 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.909
 to comment on January metrics one 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.030
 campaign has to have three neuromed cas 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.820
 attention memory emotion ok 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.620
 and then I have to make sure that I go 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.840
 to draw attention that I will have a high 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.880
 level of mobilization that is otherwise 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.830
 thing I saw a business so do more 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.680
 or less pick the brand do not remember 11 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.650
 had no memory had attention just not 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.390
 had mobilization okay and also have to have 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.710
 emotion we record things by 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.690
 emotion just ask you what 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.850
 happened on November 20 of the year 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.110
 few will know that it is 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.899
 doing that day 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.370
 Now for you, what have you done or are you doing? 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.709
 making September 11 remember 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.080
 because there is a trauma associated with it 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.640
 an emotion or wondering how the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.790
 your wedding day women will 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.470
 remember wedding details like 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.330
 was the day your child was born and if 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.489
 even if it is also this is very 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.319
 close to the old one of a medium brain 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.590
 that the brain of emotions 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.959
 then it is closely linked to emotion okay then 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.000
 taking this into account I will 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.579
 show you this campaign and give 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.409
 how it has elements that are 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.140
 interesting to the brain so 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.709
 that might call so much attention and theme 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.709
 June 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360
 was also with bruno milar of einstein 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.340
 that beside the reason and the people also 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.180
 controlled monkey is the side more 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.770
 rational right so I love Coke I 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.350
 I take at least three a day that I know 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.040
 that the cup has a goal then 34 comodato 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.330
 more 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.520
 So I know it's a form of me. 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.750
 help coca cola continue 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.810
 promoting the happiness the world the PRP 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.910
 the future lies in what companies 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.680
 are worried about what kind of emotions 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.380
 they will generate in consumers 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.209
 related to their products in 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.280
 have a business called pockets had the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.050
 transformation of the sugar commodity is not 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.540
 more sugar has premium sugar 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.330
 dirty and organic so all the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.130
 types and then how companies transform 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.019
 commodity or show a commercial of 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.790
 something that is commodity but communication 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.550
 is not charismatic and commercial is a 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.709
 campaign that you will understand that changes 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.690
 various neural patterns to make 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.300
 you pay more attention to the table 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.000
 brain is selfish and responds for you 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.709
 You and you do not ask what the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.769
 revenue from innovation there is 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.180
 innovation there are no 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.829
 after innovating in communication and 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.049
 technology in people 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.150
 I would like to say goodbye to her 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.079
 farewell to the van that for me was mine 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.030
 parents, this is bad if no one expects 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.850
 which today has achieved in some way 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.590
 make you feel diverse sensations 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.239
 and emotions 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.100
