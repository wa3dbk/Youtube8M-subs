00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.650
 them 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.889
 today in learn to drive we are going to 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.809
 teach how to start on a slope 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:16.280
 much more inclined is pending can 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.560
 have approximately between 40 35 40 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.690
 degrees is a very steep slope in 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240
 a very normal city ​​of colombia 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.230
 true then so that you are 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.760
 calmer and support or help with the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.060
 handbrake for the kart not you 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.010
 send back 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.690
 and have security and be calm 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.610
 if for some reason they have to take a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.170
 skirt of these because it 's inevitable in 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.660
 his journey to work for the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.940
 university then we rely on the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.320
 handbrake so that the car or the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.710
 emergency so the car is safe 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.449
 We are going to put the first one and already with 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.160
 the handbrake ready here in your hand 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.040
 we are ready to go down 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.829
 quickly and we do the exercise 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.960
 normal to sink the accelerator while 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.350
 let's loose the front let's do 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.839
 the test right now then I have the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.750
 handbrake hold strongly and I'll 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.909
 to release the pedal brake and oscar 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.460
 vacuum cleaner and Emilio I started doing what 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.510
 same as I did on the other occasion 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.909
 exactly the same but what happens that 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.340
 already one day I'm going to release the brake 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.960
 emergency like this the emergency brake in 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.720
 this moment is low and has just released 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.119
 I climbed the clutch 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.790
 and I have the accelerator and here I can 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.770
 make the same slope the same as 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.850
 I'm doing the point we made in 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.990
 a softer rise then 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 we find him 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 then here we finish uploading the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.500
 pending 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.659
 for some reason they do not end well I have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 enough strength 3 has to follow 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.990
 doing the exercise until the car 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.630
 finish climbing the slope remember 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.460
 clutch throttle clutch accelerator 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.530
 See you at the next of learning to 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 driving like this we climb an incline with 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.820
 a very high inclination
