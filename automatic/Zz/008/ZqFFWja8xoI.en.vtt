00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.360
 the preparation for these games 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.270
 globally it was believed that he would get 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.460
 this medal because the truth did not have 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 budget I wanted to lower my brand 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.500
 but next week we will be 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.030
 competing in russia I think that it is 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.830
 a prize for the work that has been 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.000
 done all year and a prize to this 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.620
 public also what came to us 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.090
 accompany then even though I do not know 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.420
 achieved the gold that was the goal 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.460
 I gave him everything he had and there 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.020
 a reward anything can 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.740
 spend the same touch an exit this morning 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 I read very hard 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.000
 I was the world record 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.590
 now but a bronze medal and so 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.180
 it's the sport 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 let's wait for the next opportunity to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.740
 a rematch with this result today is 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.260
 continues to show that Colombia is 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.300
 world swimming power with fins 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.730
 Of course I think we have been improving 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.710
 every time we show that we are better and 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.000

 I'm satisfied with the work 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.300

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.950
 of gold to leave the name higher 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.049
