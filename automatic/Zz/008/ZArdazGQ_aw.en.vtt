in<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.720> yoga<00:00:03.870> wheezing<00:00:11.389> I'm<00:00:12.389> not<00:00:12.570> gonna<00:00:12.780> say

in my yoga wheezing I'm not gonna say
that<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.620> final<00:00:14.070> show<00:00:14.219> if<00:00:14.370> they

that I think this final show if they

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.499 
that I think this final show if they
both<00:00:14.670> need<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> sit<00:00:15.179> down

both need to sit down

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.900 
both need to sit down
it's<00:00:15.839> looking<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:16.730> if<00:00:17.730> they

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's looking like that but if they

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.029 
it's looking like that but if they
