before<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:28.059> LED<00:00:28.419> burns<00:00:28.599> out<00:00:28.960> there's<00:00:29.860> much

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
before the LED burns out there's much

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.380 
before the LED burns out there's much
easier<00:00:30.550> way<00:00:32.250> yeah<00:00:33.250> most<00:00:33.910> people<00:00:33.969> ain't<00:00:34.210> gonna

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
easier way yeah most people ain't gonna

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.549 
easier way yeah most people ain't gonna
recognize<00:00:34.750> that<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:36.399> says<00:00:36.700> right<00:00:36.879> on<00:00:36.910> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
recognize that it says right on it

do any damage to the LED let me turn the
camera<00:01:25.930> around<00:01:25.960> I'll<00:01:26.260> show<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.500> exactly<00:01:26.740> what

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
camera around I'll show you exactly what

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.180 
camera around I'll show you exactly what
I'm<00:01:27.040> talking<00:01:27.370> about

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
I'm talking about

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.500 
I'm talking about
okay<00:01:30.190> another<00:01:30.460> good<00:01:30.700> reason<00:01:30.910> for<00:01:31.390> why<00:01:31.480> you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
okay another good reason for why you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.220 
okay another good reason for why you
want<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.110> use<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.650> test<00:01:32.890> your<00:01:33.070> LEDs<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:34.230> if

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
want to use this to test your LEDs is if

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.590 
want to use this to test your LEDs is if
you<00:01:35.380> got<00:01:35.500> like<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> little<00:01:35.800> scrap<00:01:36.640> pack<00:01:36.970> like<00:01:37.450> I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
you got like a little scrap pack like I

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.040 
you got like a little scrap pack like I
do<00:01:37.660> here<00:01:38.170> different<00:01:38.680> resistors<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.630> LEDs<00:01:40.630> and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
do here different resistors and LEDs and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.340 
do here different resistors and LEDs and
transistors<00:01:41.980> and<00:01:42.160> stuff<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:43.350> have

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
transistors and stuff like that I have

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.400 
transistors and stuff like that I have
five<00:01:44.890> millimeter<00:01:45.430> LEDs<00:01:46.360> seven<00:01:46.720> here<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.080> then

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
five millimeter LEDs seven here and then

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.150 
five millimeter LEDs seven here and then
I<00:01:47.440> also<00:01:47.740> have<00:01:49.020> three<00:01:50.020> millimeter<00:01:50.500> LEDs

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
I also have three millimeter LEDs

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.700 
I also have three millimeter LEDs
sitting<00:01:51.490> here<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.690> problem<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:53.140> they're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
sitting here and the problem is they're

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.800 
sitting here and the problem is they're
all<00:01:53.740> clear<00:01:54.220> tops<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:55.090> don't<00:01:55.480> know<00:01:55.570> if<00:01:55.660> this

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
all clear tops so I don't know if this

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.060 
all clear tops so I don't know if this
is<00:01:55.990> white<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.850> blue<00:01:57.850> or<00:01:58.740> ultraviolet<00:01:59.740> or

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
is white or blue or ultraviolet or

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.070 
is white or blue or ultraviolet or
infrared<00:02:00.160> or<00:02:01.120> anything<00:02:01.360> like<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:01.990> just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
infrared or anything like that it's just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.000 
infrared or anything like that it's just
ad<00:02:02.440> clear<00:02:03.070> LED<00:02:03.520> at<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.760> point<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.860> why

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
ad clear LED at this point so that's why

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.410 
ad clear LED at this point so that's why
this<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.190> also<00:02:06.370> good<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.700> have<00:02:06.820> testing<00:02:07.240> real

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
this is also good to have testing real

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.330 
this is also good to have testing real
quick<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.349> plug<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:11.340> see

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
quick so I can just plug it in and see

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.509 
quick so I can just plug it in and see
it's<00:02:12.519> basically<00:02:13.180> an<00:02:13.360> off<00:02:13.510> white<00:02:13.750> LED<00:02:14.519> it's

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
it's basically an off white LED it's

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.880 
it's basically an off white LED it's
great<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:15.849> testing<00:02:16.000> them<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.709> thought<00:02:17.709> grab

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
great for testing them I thought grab

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.440 
great for testing them I thought grab
one<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> little<00:02:18.370> three<00:02:18.580> millimeter<00:02:18.970> LEDs

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
one of the little three millimeter LEDs

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.330 
one of the little three millimeter LEDs
I'm<00:02:20.200> taking<00:02:20.470> them<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.620> stock

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
I'm taking them on stock

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.400 
I'm taking them on stock
test<00:02:23.340> them<00:02:23.520> real<00:02:23.700> quick<00:02:25.070> find<00:02:26.070> out<00:02:26.310> Oh<00:02:27.410> once

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410

test them real quick find out Oh once
again<00:02:28.620> good<00:02:28.740> connection<00:02:29.160> these<00:02:29.880> are<00:02:30.120> bright

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
again good connection these are bright

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.830 
again good connection these are bright
blue<00:02:31.460> LEDs<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.730> you're<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
blue LEDs then if you're like me and you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.030 
blue LEDs then if you're like me and you
go<00:02:36.930> rummaging<00:02:37.170> through<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> trash<00:02:37.800> every

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
go rummaging through the trash every

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.300 
go rummaging through the trash every
once<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.400> while<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.390> no<00:02:39.540> ID<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:40.020> this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
once in a while you get no ID like this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.840 
once in a while you get no ID like this
it's<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.460> flat<00:02:41.700> top<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.410> also<00:02:43.620> has<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.400> little

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
it's a flat top but it also has a little

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.760 
it's a flat top but it also has a little
black<00:02:45.270> spot<00:02:45.300> inside<00:02:46.050> there<00:02:46.320> too

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
black spot inside there too

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.100 
black spot inside there too
looks<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> little<00:02:47.250> microchip<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.150> got<00:02:48.990> this

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
looks like a little microchip I got this

from the Jersey Shore area and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.850 
from the Jersey Shore area and
everything<00:02:54.600> was<00:02:54.810> corroded<00:02:55.320> inside<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.770> it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
everything was corroded inside of it

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.880 
everything was corroded inside of it
even<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.220> solar<00:02:56.490> panel<00:02:56.970> little<00:02:57.890> amorphous

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.600 
board inside it was corroded the battery
terminals<00:03:04.230> were<00:03:04.320> completely<00:03:04.650> shot<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.460> is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
terminals were completely shot this is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.160 
terminals were completely shot this is
the<00:03:05.700> only<00:03:05.910> thing<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:06.330> saved<00:03:06.750> from<00:03:07.050> it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the only thing I actually saved from it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.750 
the only thing I actually saved from it
and<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.740> want<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.070> if<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.250> actually<00:03:08.280> works

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and I want to see if it actually works

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.810 
and I want to see if it actually works
so<00:03:08.970> here's<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.690> perfect<00:03:09.960> example<00:03:10.670> why<00:03:11.670> it's

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
so here's a perfect example why it's

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.220 
so here's a perfect example why it's
just<00:03:11.970> easy<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.360> have<00:03:12.540> one<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.780> these<00:03:12.870> around

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
just easy to have one of these around

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.490 
just easy to have one of these around
and<00:03:13.440> test<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.960> and<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.320> does<00:03:16.470> work<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:18.500> that's

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
and test it and it does work and that's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.170 
and test it and it does work and that's
what<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:19.770> little<00:03:20.100> chip<00:03:20.310> inside<00:03:20.700> there<00:03:20.970> is

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
what that little chip inside there is

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.230 
what that little chip inside there is
for<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.130> actually<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.460> called<00:03:23.820> slow

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
for this is actually a called slow

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.470 
for this is actually a called slow
color-changing<00:03:25.200> led<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:26.130> will<00:03:26.700> sit<00:03:27.120> here<00:03:27.300> and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
color-changing led it will sit here and

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.100 
color-changing led it will sit here and
cycle<00:03:27.930> through<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.940> little<00:03:30.420> lithium<00:03:30.840> ion

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
cycle through and a little lithium ion

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.360 
cycle through and a little lithium ion
battery<00:03:31.470> even<00:03:31.650> though<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:31.980> doesn't<00:03:32.190> give<00:03:32.280> out

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
battery even though it doesn't give out

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
battery even though it doesn't give out
that<00:03:32.430> much<00:03:32.910> amperage<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:35.150> safe<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
that much amperage for it is safe to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.630 
that much amperage for it is safe to
power<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:38.010> gives<00:03:38.220> enough<00:03:38.430> power

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
power this and it gives enough power

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.850 
power this and it gives enough power
that<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.000> cycle<00:03:39.450> through<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.500> colors

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
that it can cycle through all the colors

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.560 
that it can cycle through all the colors
and<00:03:41.160> let<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.580> little<00:03:41.640> chip<00:03:42.060> inside<00:03:42.330> there

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
and let that little chip inside there

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.550 
and let that little chip inside there
work<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:44.820> if<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.300> ever<00:03:45.420> see<00:03:45.630> an<00:03:45.720> OD<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:46.290> that

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
work so if you ever see an OD like that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.710 
work so if you ever see an OD like that
if<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.250> has<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> little<00:03:47.580> black<00:03:48.000> thing<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.450> side

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
if it has a little black thing on side

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600 
if it has a little black thing on side
there<00:03:48.959> that's<00:03:49.470> your<00:03:49.650> little<00:03:49.830> microchip<00:03:50.430> and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
there that's your little microchip and

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.270 
there that's your little microchip and
that<00:03:51.090> controls<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.470> cycling<00:03:52.920> through<00:03:53.130> all

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
that controls the cycling through all

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.380 
that controls the cycling through all
the<00:03:53.370> different<00:03:53.550> colors<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.209> built

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
the different colors that are built

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.690 
the different colors that are built
inside<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.019> LED<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.769> it's<00:03:56.250> still<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.580> a

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
inside of this LED and it's still just a

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.580 
inside of this LED and it's still just a
2<00:03:56.880> pin<00:03:57.090> package<00:03:58.130> or<00:03:59.209> also<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.320> little

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
2 pin package or also you get little

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.390 
2 pin package or also you get little
green<00:04:01.860> LEDs<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:03.330> one<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.780> got<00:04:04.080> out<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.709> an<00:04:05.100> old

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
green LEDs this one I got out of an old

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.720 
green LEDs this one I got out of an old
HP<00:04:05.970> printer<00:04:06.300> that<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.510> pulled<00:04:06.870> apart<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:08.580> had

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
HP printer that I pulled apart and I had

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.780 
HP printer that I pulled apart and I had
no<00:04:08.850> clue<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.239> works<00:04:12.050> not<00:04:13.050> very<00:04:13.260> bright<00:04:13.470> one

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
no clue if it works not very bright one

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.430 
no clue if it works not very bright one
what<00:04:14.790> if<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.030> keep<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.269> connection<00:04:15.450> bed<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:16.410> a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
what if I keep the connection bed not a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.289 
what if I keep the connection bed not a
very<00:04:16.620> bright<00:04:16.769> one<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.580> does<00:04:17.850> show<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.180> does

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
very bright one but it does show it does

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.550 
very bright one but it does show it does
work<00:04:18.919> now<00:04:19.919> again<00:04:20.160> it's<00:04:21.150> slightly<00:04:22.019> warm<00:04:22.200> to

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
work now again it's slightly warm to

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.050 
work now again it's slightly warm to
touch<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.220> don't<00:04:23.430> leave<00:04:23.550> these<00:04:23.669> plugged<00:04:23.910> in

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
touch so don't leave these plugged in

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.730 
touch so don't leave these plugged in
too<00:04:24.240> long<00:04:24.450> otherwise<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.020> could<00:04:25.530> risk

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
too long otherwise you could risk

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.490 
too long otherwise you could risk
burning<00:04:26.100> out<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.669> lower<00:04:26.940> voltage<00:04:27.180> LEDs<00:04:27.780> again

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
burning out the lower voltage LEDs again

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.980 
burning out the lower voltage LEDs again

like the greens or Reds the yellows
Amber's<00:04:31.979> their<00:04:32.550> lower<00:04:32.760> voltage<00:04:33.210> only<00:04:33.419> need

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
Amber's their lower voltage only need

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.220 
Amber's their lower voltage only need
like

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
like

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.270 
like
things<00:04:34.410> like<00:04:34.500> 1/2<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.670> 2<00:04:35.910> volts<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.980> is<00:04:38.160> a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
things like 1/2 to 2 volts so this is a

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.170 
things like 1/2 to 2 volts so this is a
3<00:04:38.550> volt<00:04:38.700> lithium<00:04:39.120> ion<00:04:39.360> battery<00:04:39.750> inside<00:04:40.140> here

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
3 volt lithium ion battery inside here

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.560 
3 volt lithium ion battery inside here
it<00:04:42.180> will<00:04:42.390> eventually<00:04:42.540> burn<00:04:43.170> these<00:04:43.410> up<00:04:44.570> so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
it will eventually burn these up so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.330 
it will eventually burn these up so
that's<00:04:45.870> my<00:04:46.020> little<00:04:46.170> tip<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.650> trick<00:04:46.740> for

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
that's my little tip and trick for

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.270 
that's my little tip and trick for
people<00:04:47.580> who<00:04:47.700> love<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.940> play<00:04:48.480> with<00:04:48.510> LEDs<00:04:49.380> so

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
people who love to play with LEDs so

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.010 
people who love to play with LEDs so
until<00:04:51.000> next<00:04:51.150> time<00:04:51.770> have<00:04:52.770> fun
