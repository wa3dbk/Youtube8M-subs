off the back that is it took forever for

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.209 
off the back that is it took forever for
the<00:00:11.309> controller<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.820> come<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.990> took<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:14.160> least

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
so that's one bad thing but hopefully

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.880 
so that's one bad thing but hopefully
the<00:00:21.119> controller<00:00:21.510> makes<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:23.359> because

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
the controller makes up for it because

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.589
