How to improve the usability of a website?

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.259
What is usability? Usability is a concept
that characterizes the overall user-friendly

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.890
interface, intuitive navigation and access
to information on the website. You need to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.700
remember the following factors to achieve
a high level of usability.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.700
7Â±2

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.789
The ability of human short-term memory is
limited and can not handle more than 5-9 items

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.510
at the same time. Therefore, the navigation
menu is not worth doing more than 5-7 points.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.820
The rule of 3 clicks

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.230
Make the whole information accessible in 3
clicks for the user visited your site with

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.230
pleasure. If it is impossible, make sure that
the user always knows where he has been and

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.440
where he needs to move on.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.850
The rule of 2 seconds

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.850
Two seconds - this is the time for which the
reaction must take place on a website after

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.200
any user action.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.030
80/20 rule or the Pareto

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
Take into account the opinion of only those
users who are really important to your business.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.659
Usually there are no more than 20% of total
of your site visitors, but they bring 80%

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.240
of benefit.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.780
Aim for a logical

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.780
All elements of your site should be built
on the same method. This will ensure the simplicity

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.900
and the ease of navigation.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.350
Quick Way

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.520
Make it possible to perform basic functions
on your website by a quick method, such as

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.390
using hotkeys or direct links.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.509
Cancelling of actions

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.409
Provide an easy way to cancel or to fix the
perfect user actions.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.110
Under control

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.799
The user must be sure that he manages the
process and moves to the right direction.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.240
Feedback

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.240
The website should always have a form of feedback
or an affordable way to communicate with you.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.920
This will show your concern about the user.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770
Do not overload the short-term memory

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.149
Do not overload the website with additional
elements that interfere to focus on basic

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.570
information, otherwise the user can simply
forget the reason of visiting the website.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.810
Do not forget that the simplicity, accessibility
and consistency are the most important parameters

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.819
of a convenient and intuitive websites.
