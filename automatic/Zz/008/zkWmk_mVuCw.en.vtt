00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hi guys, how are you? We'll learn how to do it. 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.700
 these luminaires made with the glass of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.010
 preserve 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 so now let's go to the necessary material 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.790
 You will need preserved glass after 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.410
 You're going to take it out is that label here. 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 because glass has to have everything 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
 transparent 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.100
 You're going to need ink. I 'll use the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.039
 spray paint but if you want you can 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 use the pva ink without the normal 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.670
 you use the pva ink and you will need 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.080
 a brush is so I advise it to be 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.149
 This roller brush because I found it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 it was a lot better to paint 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.590
 cover just as well as linen 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 and in the parts where the volume reached you 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.399
 You can paint with a brush and I 'll be 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.440
 using these inks too 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.320
 I 'm going to wear white to do that. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 effect you saw around me 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 drawing, you 're going to need a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.550
 self-adhesive tape and a tape for 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 increase a little more 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.219
 decoration 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 You'll need scissors and candles. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.619
 this one are the scented candles that okay 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.330
 I had there or those old ladies 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.119
 simpler here normal 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.060
 ok let's go then I 'll walk first 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 I'll start by cutting it here on paper 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.360
 adhesive a heart so I was double 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.360
 like this 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.050
 and I will remember the shape of a heart 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:38.510
 Okay, now I 'm going to get the glass. 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:41.720
 I'll take the heart is here where is 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.790
 Look, I'm going to highlight my sheet here and 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.370
 I'll put it right here, I'll go 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.370
 center right here my heart 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.730
 Ready now you have to press well. 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.180
 the self-adhesive paper mainly here 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.240
 on the edges look ready now we're going 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.070
 To paint like I said I chose this 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.010
 spray paint and it's with her that I go 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.560
 trying to paint does not spray paint 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.380
 so very closely goes in a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.930
 distance a little farther away 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.060
 because if you pass too close to the ink 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.700
 will become thick and will then drain the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.360
 ideal is small splashed so more 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.360
 far're 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.620
 now I'm going to accelerate the process of 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.049
 drying with dryer pa 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.540
 now how can you see the ink already 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.879
 dried out i'm going to take this paper 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.950
 from here we 'll see how 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.459
 is that drawing was here with 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:03:02.220
 care I'll remove that it complies 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:07.629
 this self-adhesive role here people ready 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:13.590
 Look, we just took it and now we're going to give it 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:16.450
 It's the last detail here that I'm going to get 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.680
 here in my ink box I go 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.049
 Pick up white color and I'll make a detail 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.590
 around the heart so now with a 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.439
 white paint is with a little pussy so I 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.709
 I'm going to draw a picture here around the 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.709
 heart 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.620
 I'm ready, people, I've already finished peace beyond 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.730
 do a detail 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:58.950
 Now we'll get something done. 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.650
 people going to tie will make a good tie 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.660
 pretty here in front 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.660
 ready to people already may tie 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.110
 Look how beautiful the painting stayed 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:16.320
 Perfectly well covered the glass well 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.000
 now here's a blue model with the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.660
 little stars 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.180
 then just us choose the candle is 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.830
 so now I'm going to light the candle 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.790
 put candles inside we will see 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.790

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.890
