00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.500
 hello god today we continue talking about 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.720
 self-locking papers and for that 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.460
 today we are going to use unlike the 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.630
 last video shown that we use the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.289
 reverse today we're going to use the 8 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.739
 we will assemble it as it is known 8 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.909
 Italian we will ride 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.849
 directly on the rope of this the 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:31.449
 finger in a lateral position and such 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.699
 way that produces we start the one that 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.190
 produce a self- blocking we will start with 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.410
 a self-locking position and for 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.329
 descend only we will have to 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.530
 interact we have to act on 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.839
 the downloading is worth it to start this 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.670
 this rattle the before any 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.620
 eventuality we will only have to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.350
 stop exercising force on him and 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.480
 automatically our device without 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.969
 nothing added without any other element 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.980
 added will auto block according 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.920
 let's move on to explain it 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.420
 coactive 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.540
 as always we have the rope 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.090
 predisposed by which we are going to peel 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.330
 we take the 8 as we always do 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 we passed a loop through the large building 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.250
 we introduce it and attentive here not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.680
 we ended up not worth going back to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.960
 go through the small hole but 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 At this point what we do is between 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 turn not to turn downwards from 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.070
 agreement we take a turn down and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.290
 we put it back inside 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.909
 in this way what we get is 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.530
 produce a strangulation of the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.110
 rope in this case in the sense that 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 we are interested downwards as 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 you can observe when I load weight 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.380
 over the element when biting the rope 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.869
 to the sea with the other one is strangled 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.760
 however in the position of promotion not 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.070
 there is no problem is released but the 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.340
 moment when I reload weight as 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.259
 I say there is extravagance that either 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 you have to keep in mind that in this 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.720
 position on 8 we will remain as 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.610
 observe in lateral position at the time 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.070
 of carrying weight we will observe that the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.590
 small hole will move towards the 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.030
 top of agreement let's go to 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.410
 prove it 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.410
 for this we leave randomly 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.760
 everything we can 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.960
 from there we will use as 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.670
 always the long havana to enter us 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.050
 where we will do we will 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.390
 anchor in the lower part of the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.460
 big hole we're going to anchor here 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.740
 fair 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.700
 and think a little more so that a 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.160
 little bit more perfect right now 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.170
 we are ready to start the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.110
 rappelling maneuver when I 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.110
 I remember I 'll be auto blocked 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.360
 as you can see right now as you 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 I was commenting I'm auto blocking loose 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.819
 the rope and I'm hanging there's nothing 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.879
 in the interactive room and I'm 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.650
 blocked as I say for editing the 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.280
 descent that is what I have to do 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.319
 as I said before or directly 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.659
 with your hand take the small hole and 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.420
 operate it downwards according to turn 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.239
 8 down when it starts to go down 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.220
 I notice that I extend 66 you see the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.349
 destroyer at the moment in which I 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.329
 Any circumstance occurs or 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.060
 I just want to stop just 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.790
 I have to release the hand of 8 on 8 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.390
 he gets up again he strangles 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.420
 I got the rope and it fit perfectly 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.790
 auto blocked agreed to repeat for 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.890
 that you check what I said action towards 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.129
 down today going down I'm going forward has the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.500
 point where I'm interested I loose and it 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.850
 autonomy 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.630
 in addition another descent more that is going to us 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.830
 allow to face the rappels with 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.640
 security at all times of agreement 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:13.140
 8 Italian mode to make a 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.770
 auto descent what ado 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.770
 goodbye
