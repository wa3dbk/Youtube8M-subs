just do this for ten minutes and you're
done<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.440> your<00:02:19.530> iphone<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> i<00:02:21.510> can't<00:02:21.959> believe

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
done with your iphone so i can't believe

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.869 
done with your iphone so i can't believe
is<00:02:22.379> what<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.560> feels<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.829> on<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.129> stand<00:02:23.519> let's

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
is what it feels like on a stand let's

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.400 
is what it feels like on a stand let's
see<00:02:24.030> what<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.180> feels<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.170> street

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
see what it feels like on the street

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.619 
see what it feels like on the street
let's<00:02:25.769> go<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:26.640> cool<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.209> really

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
now i'm going to be doing the real bike

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.039 
now i'm going to be doing the real bike
ride<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.400> let's<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:44.940> what<00:02:45.060> i<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.269> make<00:02:45.599> is

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
ride and let's see what i can make is

00:02:46.049 --> 00:03:05.340 
ride and let's see what i can make is
what<00:02:46.319> kind<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.620> energy<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:47.280> make

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.670 

either<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.160> was<00:03:06.580> really<00:03:07.000> fun<00:03:07.240> guys<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:08.110> didn't

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
either that was really fun guys I didn't

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.310 
either that was really fun guys I didn't
even<00:03:08.740> feel<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.640> was<00:03:09.970> making<00:03:10.330> any<00:03:10.570> extra

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
even feel like I was making any extra

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.890 
even feel like I was making any extra
effort<00:03:11.800> at<00:03:11.980> all<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.760> making<00:03:13.150> energy<00:03:13.330> it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
effort at all in making energy it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.070 
effort at all in making energy it's
pretty<00:03:14.080> easy<00:03:14.290> huh<00:03:14.530> very<00:03:15.100> cool<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.730> love<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.150> how

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
pretty easy huh very cool I love it how

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.930 
pretty easy huh very cool I love it how
many<00:03:17.350> times<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.160> charge<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:18.730> battery

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
many times can I charge this battery

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.970 
many times can I charge this battery
well<00:03:19.600> this<00:03:19.840> battery<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.260> good<00:03:20.710> for<00:03:20.890> about

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
well this battery is good for about

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.900 
well this battery is good for about
2,000<00:03:21.730> charges<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.250> way<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.550> think<00:03:24.760> about

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
2,000 charges and the way to think about

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.510 
2,000 charges and the way to think about
it<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> rechargeable<00:03:26.170> battery<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.740> has

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
it it's a rechargeable battery and has

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.600 
it it's a rechargeable battery and has
the<00:03:27.730> equivalent<00:03:28.030> its<00:03:29.020> life<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.530> about<00:03:29.710> 15,000

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
the equivalent its life is about 15,000

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.920 
the equivalent its life is about 15,000
double-a<00:03:30.940> batteries<00:03:31.390> that's<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.630> good<00:03:31.750> way<00:03:31.870> to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
double-a batteries that's a good way to

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.260 
double-a batteries that's a good way to
compare<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:33.060> thousands<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.150> AA<00:03:34.240> batteries

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
compare it to thousands of AA batteries

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.510 
compare it to thousands of AA batteries
so<00:03:35.260> how<00:03:35.410> long<00:03:35.650> am<00:03:35.800> I<00:03:35.890> going<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.100> pay<00:03:36.220> off<00:03:36.250> my

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
so how long am I going to pay off my

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.790 
so how long am I going to pay off my
investments<00:03:37.210> well<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.350> way<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> think

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
investments well so the way to think

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.590 
investments well so the way to think
about<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.640> if<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.060> were<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.300> buy<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
about it is if you were to buy the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.690 
about it is if you were to buy the
equivalent<00:03:41.170> energy<00:03:41.320> in<00:03:41.800> double-a<00:03:42.310> batteries

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
equivalent energy in double-a batteries

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.320 
equivalent energy in double-a batteries
its<00:03:42.910> 150th<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.960> cost<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.530> 50<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.980> 150<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:46.060> one

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
its 150th the cost so 50 to 150 to one

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.820 
its 150th the cost so 50 to 150 to one
so<00:03:46.900> I'm<00:03:47.050> going<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.290> be<00:03:47.380> paying<00:03:47.530> off<00:03:47.650> my

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
so I'm going to be paying off my

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.820 
so I'm going to be paying off my
investment<00:03:48.250> pretty<00:03:48.640> soon<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.840> hope<00:03:50.050> so<00:03:50.380> i<00:03:50.410> am

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
investment pretty soon I hope so i am

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.800 
investment pretty soon I hope so i am
and<00:03:51.190> having<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.000> lot<00:03:52.120> more<00:03:52.150> fun<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.660> same

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
and having a lot more fun at the same

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.790 
and having a lot more fun at the same
time<00:03:53.020> very<00:03:53.470> cool<00:03:53.920> i<00:03:54.100> love<00:03:54.550> it
