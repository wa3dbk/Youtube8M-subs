00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 I do not know if you ever stopped to think 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 but because in england the staff 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:26.760
 drive the opposite side of the car already 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.300
 stopped to fix this already for 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.210
 why this needs more 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.969
 audience explains to you now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 It all started in medieval times where 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.200
 knights thought it best to walk 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.760
 horse on the left side as 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.570
 there was more frankness with the hand 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 right 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.280
 it was easier to attack the opponent 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.690
 something of the sort like that of attack 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.039
 but it all began in medieval times 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 here in the other that two people have the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.969
 possibility to play on the right side 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.780
 where you have a vision totally 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.850
 differentiated from the one you are 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
 accustomed to driving on the left 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 of the vehicle but out of the whole design 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.799
 it's the same is a normal car is a way 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.840
 normal is a normal vehicle 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.290
 the only thing that changes is your 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.420
 inside the pedals are in the same order 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 that we are accustomed to be the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.869
 which is that you step on the clutch it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.600
 It will not come to the accelerator. 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.030
 it is still the clutch but the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 exchange goes on in the middle so you go 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.490
 have to use the gearshift as the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.310
 your left hand a little complicated 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 beyond the first moments however you 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.939
 Can drive a truck, I'd say 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 which would be complicated in the 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.000
 maneuvering a directed part by driving 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.259
 would be easy because every vehicle is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 easy to drive 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.479
 however seasonal it is a great 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.909
 problem said English is not 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.890
 exclusively from England because some 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.010
 other countries such as japan 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.710
 also uses 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.290
 only on the right side of the vehicle is not a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 thing totally exclusive of england 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.930
 but I believe it was invented by 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.420
 there in that medieval time a certain galley 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.830
 Then subscribe to our channel left 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 haiti in this video and share with 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.020
 friends for them to know what went 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.600
 invented English direction also a 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.430
 little bit of why it was invented right 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.950
 I'm going to stay here a big hug to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.950
 You know each other more
