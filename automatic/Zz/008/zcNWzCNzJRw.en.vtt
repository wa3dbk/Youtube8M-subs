by<00:00:35.650> bison<00:00:36.180> I've<00:00:37.180> been<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.360> big<00:00:37.540> rugby<00:00:37.870> fan<00:00:38.230> so

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
by bison I've been a big rugby fan so

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.760 
by bison I've been a big rugby fan so
maybe<00:00:38.860> twenty<00:00:39.280> odd<00:00:39.370> years<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.880> then<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:41.620> no

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
maybe twenty odd years and then I had no

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.650 
maybe twenty odd years and then I had no
knowledge<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.250> rugby<00:00:42.640> perhaps<00:00:42.940> outside<00:00:43.480> of

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
knowledge of rugby perhaps outside of

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.090 
knowledge of rugby perhaps outside of
her<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:44.320> know<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.710> countries<00:00:45.070> that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
her you know that the countries that

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.000 
her you know that the countries that
stage<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.730> perform<00:00:46.059> at<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.300> world<00:00:46.480> cup<00:00:46.690> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
stage and perform at the world cup and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.140 
stage and perform at the world cup and
so<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:48.100> was<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.309> good<00:00:48.400> chance<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.879> get<00:00:49.030> to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
so this was a good chance to get to

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.000 
so this was a good chance to get to
investigate<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.660> communities<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.440> provide

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
investigate the communities and provide

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.640 
investigate the communities and provide
them<00:00:51.430> with<00:00:51.490> a<00:00:51.700> perhaps<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.240> platform<00:00:52.750> to<00:00:52.840> talk

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
them with a perhaps a platform to talk

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.290 
them with a perhaps a platform to talk
about<00:00:53.830> what<00:00:54.220> their<00:00:54.370> needs<00:00:54.520> are<00:00:54.820> what<00:00:55.060> what

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
about what their needs are what what

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
in general it's all very admirable but

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.969

go through such a barren landscape for

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.030 
go through such a barren landscape for
