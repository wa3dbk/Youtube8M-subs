drive down this this the knee goes this
way<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.220> called<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.179> way<00:00:31.250> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
way is actually called this way this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.350 
way is actually called this way this
curve<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.200> go<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.010> same<00:00:35.760> time<00:00:36.059> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
curve you go this way and same time this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.110 
curve you go this way and same time this
one<00:00:36.660> goes<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:40.370> see<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> different

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
one goes this way see this is different

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
one goes this way see this is different
plane<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.410> need<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:44.840> here<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.770> need<00:00:47.129> code

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
plane this need go here this need code

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.860 
plane this need go here this need code
here<00:00:49.219> that's<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.300> wall<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:53.280> ball

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
here that's because this wall this ball

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.060 
here that's because this wall this ball
rotating<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:56.030> three-dimensional<00:00:57.710> it's<00:00:58.710> not

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
rotating is three-dimensional it's not

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.939 
rotating is three-dimensional it's not
only<00:00:59.460> turning<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.300> lot<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> people<00:01:01.050> do

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
only turning here a lot of people do

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.230 
only turning here a lot of people do
usual<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.640> there<00:01:03.710> we<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> read<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> again

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
usual like there we get it read it again

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.770 
usual like there we get it read it again
because<00:01:06.869> you're<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> same<00:01:07.920> plank

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
because you're in the same plank

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.820 
because you're in the same plank
but<00:01:09.780> once<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.290> fall<00:01:11.630> rotating

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
but once this fall rotating

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
but once this fall rotating
three-dimensional<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.970> goes<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.540> this

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
three-dimensional so this goes down this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.450 
three-dimensional so this goes down this
goes<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:17.150> yeah<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.840> try<00:01:19.080> again<00:01:19.460> push

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
goes out yeah you can try again push

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:37.870 
goes out yeah you can try again push
here

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880 

this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> safecracker<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> same

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
this is safecracker this is the same

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.480 
this is safecracker this is the same
practice<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:43.080> think<00:01:43.260> is<00:01:43.770> still

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
practice and what I don't think is still

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.090 
practice and what I don't think is still
same<00:01:44.880> friend<00:01:47.000> does<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> same<00:01:48.510> treasure<00:01:49.100> it's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
same friend does this same treasure it's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.380 
same friend does this same treasure it's
like<00:01:50.370> this<00:01:50.610> fall<00:01:51.110> three<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
like this fall three the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.820 
like this fall three the
three-dimensional<00:01:54.390> rotating<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.850> expending

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
three-dimensional rotating and expending

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.850 
three-dimensional rotating and expending
then<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:59.010> get<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> train<00:01:59.730> down<00:01:59.970> your<00:02:00.210> lane<00:02:00.860> it's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
then you get a train down your lane it's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.020 
then you get a train down your lane it's
very<00:02:02.490> hard<00:02:03.000> training<00:02:04.010> train<00:02:05.010> this<00:02:05.310> way<00:02:05.370> but

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
very hard training train this way but

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.530 
very hard training train this way but
stay<00:02:06.270> head<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.410> can<00:02:07.590> open<00:02:07.830> your

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
stay head this way so you can open your

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:26.390 
stay head this way so you can open your
attendant<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.860> circle<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.680> feel<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
attendant this is one circle you feel a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
attendant this is one circle you feel a
lot<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.790> pressure<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.960> not<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> hardness

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
lot of pressure but not a hardness

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.270 
lot of pressure but not a hardness
because<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.750> pressure<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.440> most<00:02:31.740> heart

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
because the pressure the most heart

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.500 
because the pressure the most heart
pressure<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.110> bottom<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.680> my<00:02:34.890> seat<00:02:35.510> so

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
pressure is on the bottom of my seat so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.310 
pressure is on the bottom of my seat so
all<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.020> taking<00:02:37.580> my<00:02:38.580> hand<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:42.290> needed<00:02:43.290> that

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
all the taking my hand I needed that

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.970 
all the taking my hand I needed that
pressure<00:02:44.070> same<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:45.060> he<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.450> pushing<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.770> is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
pressure same as he is pushing this is

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.870 
pressure same as he is pushing this is
same<00:02:47.310> pressure<00:02:47.780> over<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:49.130> then<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.160> turned

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
same pressure over there then I turned

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.930 
same pressure over there then I turned
this<00:02:51.890> circle<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.670> way<00:02:55.040> yeah<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.640> reason

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
this circle this way yeah the reason

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.180 
this circle this way yeah the reason
that<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.090> turn<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.510> way<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:58.190> he's

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that I turn this way because he's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.540 
that I turn this way because he's
pressure<00:02:59.580> go<00:03:00.030> see<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.430> need<00:03:02.430> it

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
pressure go see of this one I need it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.760 
pressure go see of this one I need it
gave<00:03:02.790> him<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.390> room<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.520> back<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:06.150> and

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
gave him more room if I go back here and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.180 
gave him more room if I go back here and
go<00:03:07.820> forth<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.120> forth<00:03:09.420> yeah<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.650> depends

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
go forth and forth yeah so this depends

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.479 
go forth and forth yeah so this depends
of<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:12.120> center<00:03:12.600> here<00:03:12.930> he's<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.160> side<00:03:14.459> of

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
of my center here he's on this side of

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.450 
of my center here he's on this side of
my<00:03:14.820> center<00:03:15.270> or<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.690> other<00:03:15.870> side

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
my center or the other side

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.600 
my center or the other side
my<00:03:16.610> son<00:03:16.870> try<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> get<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.560> out<00:03:18.770> yet<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.460> on

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
my son try to get this out yet to be on

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.270 
my son try to get this out yet to be on
this<00:03:19.790> side<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.360> my<00:03:20.540> center<00:03:21.020> and<00:03:21.470> turn<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:22.040> way

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
this side of my center and turn this way

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.700 
this side of my center and turn this way
so<00:03:26.110> that's<00:03:27.110> called<00:03:27.470> TV<00:03:28.040> listening<00:03:29.000> depression

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
so that's called TV listening depression

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.190 
so that's called TV listening depression
listening<00:03:30.710> worse<00:03:31.010> yet<00:03:31.460> he<00:03:32.120> is<00:03:32.240> not<00:03:32.450> -<00:03:32.720> this

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
listening worse yet he is not - this
