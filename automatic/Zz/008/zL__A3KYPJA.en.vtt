off that dome to make the cake level I'm

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.060 
off that dome to make the cake level I'm
using<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.600> serrated<00:00:48.840> knife<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.710> cuts<00:00:49.920> through

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
using a serrated knife that cuts through

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.139 
using a serrated knife that cuts through
the<00:00:50.160> cake<00:00:50.340> really<00:00:50.670> easily

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the cake really easily

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.770 
the cake really easily
now<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.230> discard<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.210> or<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.390> snacks

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
now you just discard that or make snacks

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
now you just discard that or make snacks
for<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> cute<00:00:55.379> yes<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
for the cute yes which is what we do it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
for the cute yes which is what we do it
all<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.610> yourself<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.140> flip<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
all for yourself and then just flip it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
all for yourself and then just flip it
over<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.070> side<00:00:59.280> has<00:00:59.550> fewer<00:00:59.850> crumbs

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
over because this side has fewer crumbs

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
over because this side has fewer crumbs
so<00:01:00.359> it'll<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.600> easier<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> frost<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.949> there's<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
so it'll be easier to frost so there's a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
so it'll be easier to frost so there's a
template<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> lay<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:04.049> on

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
template we're going to lay it out on

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
template we're going to lay it out on
the<00:01:04.769> cake<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:06.439> some<00:01:07.439> two<00:01:07.590> parts<00:01:08.010> okay<00:01:08.909> then

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the cake and some two parts okay then

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.969 
the cake and some two parts okay then
we're<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> cut<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.770> I'm

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
we're just going to cut it out with I'm

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
we're just going to cut it out with I'm
using<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> small<00:01:11.640> serrated<00:01:12.150> knife<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
using a small serrated knife like a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
using a small serrated knife like a
paring<00:01:12.930> knife<00:01:13.110> would<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.250> serration

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
paring knife would do well the serration

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.300 
paring knife would do well the serration
makes<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> easier<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> cut<00:01:15.689> through<00:01:19.159> how<00:01:20.159> long

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
makes it easier to cut through how long

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.469 
makes it easier to cut through how long
did<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> chill<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> cake<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.180> before<00:01:21.420> you

an<00:01:23.159> hour<00:01:23.369> before<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.479> cut<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.470> way

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
an hour before you cut it and that way

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
an hour before you cut it and that way
they'll<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.040> fewer<00:01:26.310> crumbs<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:26.909> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
