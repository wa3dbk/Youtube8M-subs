luscious it was great I could do
anything<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.519> wanted<00:03:03.549> but<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.900> always

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
anything I wanted but then I always

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.110 
anything I wanted but then I always
realize<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:05.980> well<00:03:06.280> when<00:03:06.519> people<00:03:07.060> go

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
realize it like well when people go

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.820 
realize it like well when people go
through<00:03:07.330> chemotherapy<00:03:07.600> they<00:03:08.350> lose<00:03:08.650> their

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
through chemotherapy they lose their

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.170 
through chemotherapy they lose their
hair<00:03:09.010> they<00:03:09.250> don't<00:03:09.430> have<00:03:09.549> something<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.150> they

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
