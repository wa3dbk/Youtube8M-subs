00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
have really a lot of strange ideas and I

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.959 
have really a lot of strange ideas and I
think<00:00:08.820> many<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.870> them<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.490> pretty<00:00:11.490> bizarre

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
think many of them are pretty bizarre

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.089

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
visits from the military scientists do

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.849 
visits from the military scientists do
you<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> mean<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.050> understand<00:00:19.529> what

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you know I mean do you understand what

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.260 
you know I mean do you understand what
their<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.490> they're<00:00:20.640> doing<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.090> well<00:00:21.240> let's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
their what they're doing here well let's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.570 
their what they're doing here well let's
come<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.170> mean<00:00:22.350> when<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.590> senses<00:00:23.160> come<00:00:23.400> in

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
come in you mean when the senses come in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.150 
come in you mean when the senses come in
and<00:00:23.730> shoot<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.210> beams<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.830> yeah<00:00:25.830> they're

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and shoot the beams up yeah they're

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
and shoot the beams up yeah they're
shooting<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.240> beams<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.769> that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
shooting the beams up and I think that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.310 
shooting the beams up and I think that
heats<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:30.119> small<00:00:30.570> space<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
heats a little small space in the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
heats a little small space in the
ionosphere<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.579> you've<00:00:33.210> got<00:00:33.390> guys<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
ionosphere and then you've got guys that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.729 
ionosphere and then you've got guys that
are<00:00:34.140> sitting<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> computers<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:37.110> people

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
are sitting on computers you got people

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
are sitting on computers you got people
putting<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.690> weather<00:00:39.690> polls<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.320> measure

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
putting up weather polls that measure

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080 
putting up weather polls that measure
weather<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> everything<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.030> mean

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
weather and everything like that I mean

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
weather and everything like that I mean
there's<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.480> that's<00:00:42.690> spooky<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.530> here

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
there's so that's spooky going on here

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.799 
there's so that's spooky going on here
there<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.640> been<00:00:44.760> claims<00:00:45.030> made<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.450> some

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
there have been claims made by some

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.040 
there have been claims made by some
scientists<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.780> heat<00:00:49.020> up

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
scientists that that you could heat up

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.189 
scientists that that you could heat up
the<00:00:49.320> ionosphere<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.039> effect<00:00:50.309> local<00:00:50.670> weather

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
the ionosphere in effect local weather

if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.379> were<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.520> eastland<00:00:53.969> patents<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
if you were to do eastland patents I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360 
if you were to do eastland patents I
have<00:00:54.840> no<00:00:54.989> doubt<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> case<00:00:55.770> claims<00:00:56.219> are

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
have no doubt that's the case claims are

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
have no doubt that's the case claims are
being<00:00:56.550> made<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> could<00:00:57.090> disrupt<00:00:57.360> global

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

our<00:01:47.530> attention<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.310> there<00:01:48.520> was<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> document

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
our attention that there was a document

of a technical technical memorandum I I

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.969 
of a technical technical memorandum I I
think<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.390> was<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.509> 195<00:01:53.229> or<00:01:53.259> something<00:01:53.830> like

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
think it was a 195 or something like

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.460 
think it was a 195 or something like
that<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.640> reading<00:01:55.450> right<00:01:55.780> in<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.049> front<00:01:56.350> of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
that and reading right in the front of

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.730 
that and reading right in the front of
it

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.149 
it
they<00:01:57.549> said<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.299> bottom<00:01:58.840> line<00:01:59.020> although<00:01:59.740> this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
they said that bottom line although this

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.969 
they said that bottom line although this
is<00:02:00.399> here<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.000> does<00:02:01.299> not<00:02:01.330> constitute

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is here it does not constitute

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.469 
is here it does not constitute
publication<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.550> doesn't<00:02:03.850> exist<00:02:04.149> it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
publication it doesn't exist it

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.630 
publication it doesn't exist it
basically<00:02:04.960> doesn't<00:02:05.259> exist<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.310> was<00:02:06.429> kind

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
basically doesn't exist so it was kind
