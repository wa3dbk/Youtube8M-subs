00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi my nas and fuel and today we 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.330
 is found for a video a little bit 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.280
 special since today I'm going 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.480
 try to teach you 45 things that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.050
 you probably do not know about 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 Minecraft 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 I had already made a video in this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.570
 like two years ago I invite you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.760
 to see her if you're interested 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.090
 for the progress made but no more 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.800
 wait here are the 45 thing it's gone 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 the sheep keep their wool even 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 when they are invisible 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.449
 you are more likely to catch a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 fish when it rains if the area in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 which you are fishing is not 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 directly visible in the sky you have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 less chance of catching a fish 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.090
 the items bounce when they are 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 launched on stairs you can 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.659
 fix the equipment chained mail 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 with him doing while you fish 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.899
 with a silver fishing rod you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.820
 can switch to a non- fishing rod 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.800
 delighted the facts are preserved and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.930
 this will prevent your changing couch 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.269
 and take damage to preserve 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.519
 the facts outing your sword you 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.769
 can for example shoot an arrow on 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.119
 the furniture that wanted to kill and righteous 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.020
 who touches him switcher on the sword 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:09.140
 the outing the effect will be preserved this is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.520
 also valid for potions 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 walking on the soul sounds placed at 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.400
 side of the lawe will set you on fire even 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.840
 if you do not enter the lava 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.970
 the orientation of a lilypad only depends on 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.320
 of its coordinates which means that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 no matter how many times you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.619
 break it or put them down and no matter 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.630
 your orientation 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.210
 the orientation of lilypad will always be 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 there even if there is snow next to it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.689
 is impossible to grow 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.950
 big trees of the jungle 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.840
 there are several methods to do 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.670
 levitate the blocks subjected to gravity the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 more known being used in me from the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.899
 jungle a girlfriend you put the sand 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.479
 on the cocoben to break you law of the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.100
 jungle and that's the block submitted to the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.710
 gravity that is trying to avoid it 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.600
 you can use the compass and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.490
 the clock without needing to be fit 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 and just looking at the orientation of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 the arrow in the kraft table 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 the only way to have a jogging arc and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.299
 to use a book the f4 key you 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 allows you to get rid of zh shader 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.200
 when they are on the ground the boats 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:17.120
 make it possible to clear snow from starz 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.120
 are immune to explosions 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.709
 and pigs can go back to the ladders 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.000
 this is also the case for the vines 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.190
 you can plant sugar cane 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900
 in the water from the moment there is 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.920
 a block of adjacent to this cane to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.659
 sugar it is possible with strings 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.799
 or vines to fly the blocks 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.799
 subject to gravity 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.200
 the wheat blocks regenerates dycker to 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.200
 horses 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.390
 if you renamed a mob egg the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.780
 member in question will be asked with the name 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.280
 chosen with a punch bow you can 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.870
 make very big skeleton jump 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.700
 and the zombies do not burn on the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.860
 suspects rain moisturizes the earth the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.060
 sky color changes according to the biomes 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.590
 the cauldron filled with water you 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.750
 allow to relax the armor in 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.049
 leather that will use water you can 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.329
 extinguish the fire with the second that 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.400
 will use some water in a ring card 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.000
 will take you damage even in 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 falling in the water 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.780
 if you do shift + click on a TNT 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.769
 with a lighter the latter 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.769
 will not explode right away 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:49.019
 cobwebs reduce 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:50.069
 explosion damage you can know 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.659
 the number of health points of your 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.640
 dog using the height of it's 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.709
 that the higher the tail the higher the point of 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.470
 view they lose their lives that drop 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.180
 I ordered him back is that the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.169
 kids do not see when you're in 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.769
 sheets sugar canes through well 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.970
 only in vans 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.950
 you can change the order from to 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.569
 server using the shift key at 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:19.169
 houches ifvb saw from below the hat 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.699
 stone is invisible seen from below the 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.699
 shell repeater is invisible 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.419
 it is possible not to bounce on 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.900
 the islam blocks it is just enough to 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.639
 leave the space key pressed 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.349
 than annoying you to use a piston 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.660
 to break the dragon egg you can 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.729
 use a torch to put under 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.160
 of the work cassel blog on which the 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.110
 does this last pose of ropraz all 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.389
 like a block of sand if you buy 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.590
 a big zombie men his peers do not 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.819
 will not be pissed off after you 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.349
 the fens gate changes height 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.750
 when placed between two 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.580
 cowboy stone walls you can 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.069
 use of the year the world for 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.449
 feed your water hens and that's it 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.219
 already finished I hope he had 12 will 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.569
 the more I hope you have learned from 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.860
 things if that's the case do not hesitate to 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.599
