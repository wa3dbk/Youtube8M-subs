00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.020
 aimar a sac lighthouse geison and today is day 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.689
 of training sessions that will discuss 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.119
 today is the decree created by Dante 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.360
 tunnel but first I want to remember everyone 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.310
 consulting is through consulting the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.739
 registration for more information and one year 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.810
 and there, I want to leave one too. 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.660
 message of the joint promotion of 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.510
 partners ex-cordel personal supplements 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 The hydro fusion I entered wd cuts 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.480
 with a 20% discount on the person 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.270
 supplement from the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 institution also confirm 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.360
 now let's go to rep training 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.130
 Dante so gave he pleads for greater 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.950
 results in training a lot 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.410
 more free but not at all 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.490
 as a staff that trains between biceps 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.890
 every day 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.470
 the premise is to train a musician several 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.549
 but with very high intensity in 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 low volume 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.079
 he claims gains up to two times and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.130
 mail to the training sessions to be 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.499
 classic 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.569
 there is an obvious relationship with 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:21.030
 training fit ev and kick but the dante 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:24.119
 he says he has nothing to do with it, he disagrees 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.889
 to fully dedicate the training to the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.920
 It's strange since for me the training 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:30.389
 It's very similar to the hit 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.710
 difference high frequency of workouts one 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:34.619
 muscle group 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.079
 the differential start and this training is 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.999
 that you do not do that insulators 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.770
 the idea of ​​training and working 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.079
 joint exercises 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.049
 the idea of ​​it is that a 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.850
 progression of charges tell us if 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.549
 this progression is very difficult. 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.529
 limited because it is true there are 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 different varieties to mount or 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.939
 training program but a priori you will 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.469
 choose three preferred exercises for 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.520
 each muscle group 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.490
 remembering that the useless exercise 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.170
 specular are the main target here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.229
 after choosing the exercise goes 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.780
 choosing division of training can vary 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.790
 between 1 and 3 in the know and abc 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.130
 the split open you will train three 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.500
 times in the week and on ABC television 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.480
 will be four times a week the idea 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.150
 gives a rest day after training 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.160
 being that in the abc format the rest does not 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.600
 Will exist 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.170
 let's always go to the training examples ab 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.030
 in case the training of Monday 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.340
 could be made the triceps shoulder and 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.980
 back and the back workout is 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.830
 between the gap and volume in the case 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.110
 back-to -width training is when 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.960
 take the candy activism in training 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.340
 back volume picks up the smaller 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.400
 lumbar trapezius 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.490
 so it's more the pull and another more the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.190
 paddling the fourth biceps workout 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.070
 posterior quadriceps thighs 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.080
 and calves and sixth training has 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.070
 the same groups in the training of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.970
 Monday 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.190
 so will do an exercise 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.290
 different from the idea of ​​choosing three 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.210
 times for each muscle group by 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.360
 example you chose chest and bench press 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.170
 straight and leaning in decline you go 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.540
 do 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.360
 the bench press in the second bench press 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.480
 inclined in the sixth and the declining bench press 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.680
 in the following fourth s10 all 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.840
 the muscles 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.090
 note that training involves many 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.440
 but the premise is one of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.459
 low volume and high training 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.560
 intensity 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.959
 so I have of each grouping consists 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.640
 in localized heating and followed by 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.830
 a series to failure for each 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.200
 This grouping will only be a 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.080
 exercise and a series until failure 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.540
 Then you leave for the next trial. 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.000
 heaters at 3 to 5 series without 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.910
 worry about cadence and obviously with 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.280
 reduced weight and can go up a little 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.670
 to each heating series other logic 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.950
 It is very similar to the ability and now 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.150
 my advanced techniques that can be 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.489
 used 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.100
 As you progress in the tremble that 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.110
 coincidentally or not again with 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.050
 exception of the alstom company are the same 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.239
 of the g20 also the good old rech pause 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.820
 where you make the series until failure 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.520
 rest because seconds again until 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.359
 15 seconds makes the last one 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.400
 series 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.590
 in this technique of doing in repetition 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 end of each series one always do 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.360
 against slow and so that training does not 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.289
 works with full failure and five failure 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.330
 with the center we also have the repetition 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.030
 static is to make a 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.930
 hydroelectric power plant after the 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.210
 exercise 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.729
 the subway and in this case, nothing else is 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.550
 hold the weight stopped for the next 20 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.710
 for example the bench press you will hold the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.930
 bar with the angle of about 90 degrees 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.060
 of the arm in relation to the arm 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.759
 we also have the spatial repetitions that 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.949
 following the example of the bench press you go 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.289
 hold the bar, I stay doing 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.210
 mini repetitions very short movements 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.650
 at the same point it during the 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.410
 same 20 seconds 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.199
 the technique of extreme elongation after 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.389
 series that is used in the indicated fst 7 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.090
 which is also called playing the maximum 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.460
 musician who has just been trained and 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.210
 finalize a technique named from we 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.570
 do not make is to do the other 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.520
 same year after the end of the series and 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.009
 hit an x number of repetitions 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.410
 let's give an example you have your thirst there 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.199
 and engagement after failing you 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.910
 goes pro leg press and makes 20 and petitions is 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.130
 you may not be able to do the 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.440
 direct adjustment will do as many 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.180
 to breathe five times will 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.580
 doing until you reach asm team 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.220
 this technique need not be 20 and 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.250
 petitions as objective may be more 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.610
 perceived in 30 to 50 but the 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.490
 The idea is to keep fewer reps and 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.039
 on the penalty of training to 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.919
 The idea is to hit whether it's in 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.199
 repetitions every workout one after another 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.940
 between 6 and 12 weeks 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.620
 at this point you will download 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.650
 In training, you will stay two weeks. 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.419
 training with about 80% of the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.699
 loads are using 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.159
 You can change the exercises you wanted. 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.840
 keep is at your discretion 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.030
 after that stage he returns to heavy training 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.340
 again that in the same way one can 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.919
 change totally or partially 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.780
 there are also a number of indications 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.960
 Which are the best to put 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.699
 advanced techniques which do not 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.830
 no way and a lot of small 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.659
 variations for each muscle pain but I 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.159
 I do not want to stretch any further then 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.979
 I will put in the application an example of 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.810
 30 you have a notion and for whom 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.490
 want to dig deeper or the internet with 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.099
 back yes it must be hard to find 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.250
 more information would you like to test it 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.020
 willingness for geniuses cost on the channel is enough 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.280
 do not forget to evaluate if the 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.080
 favorite 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.080
 It's a hug and even more.
