know those people who didn't dance
before<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:10.149> think<00:02:10.329> that's<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.780> most

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
before I think that's the most

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.890 
before I think that's the most
satisfying<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.739> think<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.670> team<00:02:12.940> they<00:02:13.599> always

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
satisfying I think the team they always

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.309 
satisfying I think the team they always
bond

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
bond

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.349 
bond
we<00:02:14.410> always<00:02:14.530> bond<00:02:14.829> with<00:02:15.040> each<00:02:15.099> other<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.239> I

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
we always bond with each other and I

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.960 
we always bond with each other and I
think<00:02:16.599> I<00:02:17.349> really<00:02:18.099> brings<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.459> team<00:02:18.670> together

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
think I really brings a team together

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.089 
think I really brings a team together
and<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.319> makes<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:20.739> good

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
and it just makes a really good

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.879 
and it just makes a really good
