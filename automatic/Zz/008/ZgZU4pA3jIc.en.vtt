00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.549
 good 2002 to a good new video more 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.620
 news about call of duty call of duty 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 cost you know you can provide the name 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.980
 of modern warfare 4 and occupy this new 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.330
 well you know that recently in a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.550
 online store 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 basically he's the smart guy with his 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.449
 possible cover with its possible cover 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.669
 official, well, nobody you know is a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.259
 Fake needs six originals to see if 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.029
 lack and such and good in which 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.739
 basically puts into details in that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.390
 page like we are going to have an engine 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.489
 chart that will be for the next 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.009
 generation and for this and good enough 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.500
 things more not of this style not things that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.120
 really, since it was no longer a monkey 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 have a new graphic engine already 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.420
 suppose at least we hope that already 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 have a graphic engine for the next 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.850
 generation you know it's possible that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.589
 the official announcement is released on May 1 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.199
 has also leaked a kind of 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.570
 no such propaganda to that in which 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.039
 point to May 1 may release 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.019
 advertising because there will already be a trailer or 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 something like that let's hope so 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.170
 because good May 1 is falling 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 with which little we will not see if it is true 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.600
 or lie within very little this 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.519
 kind of things and today the news occupies us 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.250
 is that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.840
 a Spanish website that sells 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.340
 videogames and such will extract and good from the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.079
 I would know enough because I usually buy 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.780
 in the games there because they do not give the 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.590
 enlisted call of duty ghosts with that 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.850
 cover that we saw a few days ago and 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.649
 good will also call attention not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.299
 departure puts November 11 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.829
 November in what we already know 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.780
 all that is always usually in November 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.729
 but hey it got quite the attention of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.130
 that already use all that cover not that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.539
 cover of the game and especially then not 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.100
 had started to list with that name 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.590
 I do not think retailers and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.689
 wholesalers are not usually imbeciles 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.610
 they usually put the names and 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.860
 titles and such of the games and do this 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.030
 kind of things with which almost every time 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.849
 it is clearer to me that it is going to be the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.619
 official name or at least it does not fit 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:49.970
 almost doubt so good we'll see to see if 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.979
 May 1st is just presenting the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.390
 new game what is happening what is 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.039
 what happens to us and nothing we want to know 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.509
 let's hope that May 1 comes 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.399
 or if you do not show up to say something 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.840
 to confirm it so good nothing more 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.450
 I leave the description the link 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.069
 so you can see on the cover and just like 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.659
 already as I say in this Spanish page 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.020
 and nothing we go in the next video until 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.020
 the next
