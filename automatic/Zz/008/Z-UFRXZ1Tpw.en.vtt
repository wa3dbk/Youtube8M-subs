00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello and welcome again 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.850
 Over 90 in the garden did not let me down 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.200
 yes, the good old hobby gardeners seem 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.580
 times to be over long ago 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.049
 the fronts were clear on one 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.880
 There were crops on one side 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.859
 side the weeds there became one 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 vehemently opposed the other was allowed 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.130
 have stopped today has become 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.349
 the fronts is already softened 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.880
 It used to be valuable as it never used 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.079
 how spinach appears today in whole 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.669
 other light while the word earlier 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.750
 was vehemently opposed like this one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.650
 Today it is considered rubbery vegetables in four 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.940
 star or four star restaurants 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.920
 I speak of vulture 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.470
 Today it is quiet the bird gland know 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 and in later films we'll do it 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.110
 salad out there look again 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 I've liked me that is such a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.190
 put 34 square meters in the greenhouse 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.310
 I just let them grow and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 I now have 120 cm high 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.350
 carpet of the finest bird of prey or the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.689
 but then it's too bad for the chickens 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 feed follow me after the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.420
 name tags lining who Scheider everything 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 to feed to the chickens 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.659
 so now we were looking at how to get the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
 plant recognizes that there are some 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.619
 Identifier I have them all 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.210
 I'm not a big read 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.159
 wild plants professional so a small 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.749
 white flowers now in winter 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.280
 bad to recognize but they are there 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:37.590
 that is one feature of the other 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.829
 if she was so driven take time to be there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.420
 You notice that the leaves always 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.759
 Opposite is yes against constantly means 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 nowadays I believe so and in the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.549
 leaf axles just like tomatoes 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.289
 new shoots grow another 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.479
 identifier much clearer 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.590
 in my opinion, but if I am 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.119
 that breaks apart and style 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.549
 then I pull in there 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.889
 such a rubbery content of 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.750
 the style is much more stable again 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:12.150
 outside around 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.209
 another sign but that of mine 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.190
 Look for the best sign 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.260
 always to the knowledge if you so one 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.670
 take a game and not hold against 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.159
 they will then find on the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
 one side of a series of hair stands and 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.299
 the rest of the whole plant and in the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.230
 style is untrue 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:35.730
 therefore relatively easy to recognize them 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 not always synonymous for the layman 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.650
 still in the grass but i want me 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.000
 be surprised 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.400
 I 'm a little bit heavy on that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.829
 to collect things outside in the pampa 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.810
 because I'm never sure if there is not 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.569
 just 10 minutes of 100 cross-country skiing 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.680
 here I'm pretty sure has 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.000
 grows here peacefully in front of you 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.890
 the door from the greenhouse is to her 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.410
 has come not even cats like Rhine 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.829
 I still enjoy eating okay I 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.129
 I've explained to you like birdie too 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.019
 recognize is the taste comes later 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.819
 Who else we know recently in the garden 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.190
 this netbook youtube channel haase each one 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.599
 more of these ducks chickens themselves 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.459
 make life interesting 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.459
 then synonymous movies of me as the link to 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.389
 subscribe like -button press 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.040

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.030
 They know if they eat it or if they do 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.209
 to take that as weeds
