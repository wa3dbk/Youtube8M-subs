00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
a typical three strand braid just going

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.130 
a typical three strand braid just going
to<00:01:54.119> section<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.570> off<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> bottom

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 

I'm<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.800> do<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.220> same<00:01:59.250> thing<00:01:59.520> on<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> other

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I'm gonna do the same thing on the other

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.870 
I'm gonna do the same thing on the other
side<00:02:00.960> give<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> little<00:02:01.680> spray<00:02:06.800> brush<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:08.039> going

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
side give a little spray brush it going

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.760 
side give a little spray brush it going
forward<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.840> we're<00:02:10.080> gonna<00:02:10.170> start<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.590> braid

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
forward and we're gonna start the braid

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
forward and we're gonna start the braid
on<00:02:10.800> top<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.340> her<00:02:11.459> ear<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.610> what<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
on top of her ear and then now what you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.970 
on top of her ear and then now what you
do<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:17.010> take<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.310> braid<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:19.770> bring

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
do is you take one braid and you bring

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.030 
do is you take one braid and you bring
it<00:02:20.100> over<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.740> grab<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
it over like so and then you grab a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.830 
it over like so and then you grab a
couple<00:02:23.459> pins<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.920> pin<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.160> down<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.840> like

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
couple pins and you pin it down I like

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.500 
couple pins and you pin it down I like
to<00:02:28.020> pin<00:02:28.260> into<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.950> braid<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:30.000> necessarily

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
to pin into the braid not necessarily

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
to pin into the braid not necessarily
just<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> end<00:02:31.050> because<00:02:31.350> sometimes<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.920> do

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
just the end because sometimes if you do

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.460 
just the end because sometimes if you do
the<00:02:32.160> ends<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:32.700> slip<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.720> pin<00:02:33.959> into

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the ends it can slip but if you pin into

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.430 
the ends it can slip but if you pin into
the<00:02:34.500> braid<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:36.150> kind<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.510> keeps<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> down<00:02:37.080> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
the braid it kind of keeps it down and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.290 
the braid it kind of keeps it down and
after<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.010> pin<00:02:38.190> into<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> braid<00:02:38.880> then<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
after you pin into the braid then you

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300 
after you pin into the braid then you
can<00:02:39.480> pin<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.890> we're<00:02:40.980> gonna<00:02:41.100> do<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
can pin that in and we're gonna do the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.050 
can pin that in and we're gonna do the
same<00:02:41.550> thing<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.720> other<00:02:42.930> way<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.820> grab<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
same thing the other way and you grab a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.060 
same thing the other way and you grab a
couple<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.480> hands<00:02:48.260> we're<00:02:49.260> pinning<00:02:49.470> into<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
couple of hands we're pinning into the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.970 
couple of hands we're pinning into the
braid<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:52.440> we'll<00:02:52.769> print<00:02:53.010> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.190 

if<00:02:59.980> what<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.340> looks<00:03:00.489> like<00:03:00.670> from<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:00.909> front

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
if what it looks like from the front

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.030 
if what it looks like from the front
super-cute<00:03:02.200> give<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.920> final<00:03:03.190> spray<00:03:03.840> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
super-cute give it a final spray and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.100
