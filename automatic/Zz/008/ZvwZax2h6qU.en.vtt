00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.719
 already in Brazil is 13 now let's try a 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.760
 I'm just here with the 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.170
 This is the logitech release. 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.640
 jean 920 steering wheel for xbox or nipc it is 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.880
 a totally new model and I played 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.050
 here the project carlos of the island and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.340
 The feeling I really had is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.680
 driving a car obviously does not have a 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.630
 race car yet but this one to 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.550
 very cool experience because he has 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.829
 two engines now seems force feedback 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.510
 which is when you make a turn for a 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.390
 side and feel the pressure of the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.920
 car weight of the car forcing the steering wheel 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.510
 so it's very accurate you can do it 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.250
 feel the gear shift too 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.620
 you can use here have these two 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.540
 two butterflies here to reduce or 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.309
 you can have an optional accessory here 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.140
 which is the manual gearbox 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.690
 you can play in normal cars here 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.340
 It's very accurate too, so this is it. 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.739
 these two engines that you have inside 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.960
 besides giving an accuracy here at the time of 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.260
 Do you make the turns? 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.969
 you can feel the gear shift is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.770
 important you see the car as the car 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:09.020
 behaves every model behaves 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.149
 different from project carlos 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.799
 imagine that future simulator games 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.259
 as forces and will also be compatible 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.060
 already announced when it was to get this 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.130
 model here will be compatible then 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.840
 You're going to have all this answer I found 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.740
 well, it's very good to play a lot 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.600
 simple, right? 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.789
 the pedals also have new rubbers 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.100
 new mechanisms for you to feel 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.810
 throttle and brake pressure in the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.840
 then an hour of braking you will feel 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.909
 has some resistance there to give 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.469
 a sense of driving 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.119
 really a car racing a car 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.359
 It really is for those who like it. 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.889
 Race same right I really liked 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.689
 play with the butterflies more than 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.520
 I met here because my brother already here 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.319
 on the steering wheel does not get easier have 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.869
 here also clutch a case the project 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.310
 coffee can the clutch me just like me 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.409
 I recommend to anyone who really knows how to play 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.299
 I play the game because you can not stay 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.069
 if you do not press the clutch on the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.659
 the right time to force the engine the engine 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.249
 break ends race 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.049
 he has a number of options here in 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.520
 front is pretty cool she has the buttons 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.009
 here you control a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.000
 directional buttons here to here 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.520
 menu is so so 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.230
 is rubberized to hold leather well 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.440
 here to know the center of the steering wheel 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.620
 he turns well the sides he can do 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.600
 here a half a dozen here to power 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.490
 make the turns more closed 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.030
 I think it's cool, the other is here. 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.560
 of me is the 1 g 29 that is from 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.940
 playstation 4 pc 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.890
 He has different things and even 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.990
 same system the same the same two 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.150
 engines as I mentioned the same precision 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.220
 I played and there are also some functions 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.170
 the one in front there already indicated for 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.760
 playstation 4 ipc games 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.010
 Logitech said that this one in the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.450
 United States these two devices and 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.190
 two flyers will cost $ 400 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.300
 arrives in October they guarantee do not have 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.730
 price or release date in Brazil 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.739
 but they guarantee that it will be released on 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.540
 national market as soon as possible. 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.010
 I think it's very cool, it's very cool to have this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.680
 experience of being able to play a simulator 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.930
 neco as all these features here of course 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.130
 the steering wheel and the pedals is 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.959
 optional accessory but the steering wheel pedals 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.910
 is a country part of the seat set not 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.820
 and you would have to ride it clear that everything 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.170
 this set wanted to appear accessory 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.060
 here to have at home with that subject 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.860
 nice here but anyway if you do not 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.750
 What time is it for you to ride home? 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.489
 it's really worth it if you're a fan of 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.530
 I enjoyed this race very much for 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.750
 xbox the year is pretty cool double is also 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.000
 because you have a team resource in the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.860
 other animal buttons for shape looks 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.200
 a steering wheel of formula 1 but it's quite cool 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.260
 and or if I could I would not have several in 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.910
 house does not lack space but is very nice 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.470
 so people stay connected on the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.470
 brazil gene at e3
