anyone<00:01:23.910> buddy<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.570> Spartans<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.230> sorry<00:01:25.470> I'm

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
anyone buddy like Spartans I'm sorry I'm

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
anyone buddy like Spartans I'm sorry I'm
getting<00:01:26.340> caught<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.000> words<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
getting caught up on my words but this

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.690 
getting caught up on my words but this
is<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> big<00:01:28.710> reason<00:01:29.130> why<00:01:29.160> I<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.580> they

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is the big reason why I think they

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
is the big reason why I think they
should<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.330> huge<00:01:30.840> return<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:31.530> leads

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
should have a huge return with you leads

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
should have a huge return with you leads
maybe<00:01:32.010> even<00:01:32.250> Prometheans<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> think

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
maybe even Prometheans I know I think

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
maybe even Prometheans I know I think
that'd<00:01:33.660> be<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.200> next<00:01:34.350> step<00:01:34.680> further

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that'd be going the next step further

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
that'd be going the next step further
but<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.120> they're<00:01:36.510> gonna<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.780> anything<00:01:37.080> they

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
but if they're gonna do anything they

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 
but if they're gonna do anything they
need<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> bring<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:38.100> elites<00:01:38.580> as<00:01:38.820> playable

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
need to bring back elites as playable

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
need to bring back elites as playable
characters<00:01:39.480> and<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.830> shouldn't<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.340> make

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
characters and they shouldn't just make

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.250 
characters and they shouldn't just make
it<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:42.000> ely<00:01:42.300> they<00:01:42.480> should<00:01:42.630> make<00:01:42.660> different

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
it one ely they should make different

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.410 
it one ely they should make different
armor<00:01:43.620> sets<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.400> elite<00:01:44.760> just<00:01:45.150> like<00:01:45.300> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
armor sets for the elite just like the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.640 
armor sets for the elite just like the
Spartans<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.230> do<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.500> did

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
Spartans now they can do what they did

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.560 
Spartans now they can do what they did
with<00:01:46.890> reach<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:47.880> did<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.330> good

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
with reach because they did really good

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.750 
with reach because they did really good
that<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.650> if<00:01:49.980> they're<00:01:50.160> gonna<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.580> that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
that way but if they're gonna do it that

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.610 
that way but if they're gonna do it that
way<00:01:50.910> they<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.480> it<00:01:51.630> right<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.380> armor

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
way they got to do it right the armor

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.200 
way they got to do it right the armor
has<00:01:52.800> to<00:01:52.980> make<00:01:53.130> sense<00:01:53.370> where<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.760> is<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.120> it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
has to make sense where it is and it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.230 
has to make sense where it is and it
can't<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:55.080> unusual<00:01:55.620> like<00:01:56.520> made<00:01:57.000> up

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
can't just be some unusual like made up

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
can't just be some unusual like made up
design<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.900> if<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.350> did<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.800> unusual

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
design know if they did make the unusual

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
design know if they did make the unusual
made<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.520> design<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.940> should<00:02:00.090> make<00:02:00.120> it<00:02:00.330> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
made up design they should make it so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.210 
made up design they should make it so
you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.720> customize<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> Spartan

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
you can customize it just like a Spartan

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.340 
you can customize it just like a Spartan
so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.580> put<00:02:02.730> whatever<00:02:02.880> armor<00:02:03.390> definitely

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
so you can put whatever armor definitely

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.780 
so you can put whatever armor definitely
you<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.040> different<00:02:05.220> sets<00:02:05.640> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you want from all different sets of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.540 
you want from all different sets of
armor<00:02:06.060> pieces<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.900> those<00:02:07.080> elites<00:02:07.410> so<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
armor pieces for those elites so this is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.780 
armor pieces for those elites so this is
my<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:09.060> big<00:02:09.090> dot<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.410> topic<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:11.340> when

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
my really big dot on this topic now when

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
my really big dot on this topic now when
I<00:02:11.819> also<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.239> about<00:02:12.360> play<00:02:12.690> playable

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I also think about play playable

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.050 
I also think about play playable
characters<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.610> arbiter

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
characters I think of with the arbiter

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.390 
characters I think of with the arbiter
in<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.360> campaign<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:16.469> in<00:02:16.650> Halo<00:02:16.950> 2<00:02:17.010> where<00:02:17.370> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
in the campaign like in Halo 2 where you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.610 
in the campaign like in Halo 2 where you
could<00:02:17.609> play<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.299> master<00:02:18.749> chief<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
could play as the master chief and the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.100 
could play as the master chief and the
arbiter<00:02:20.189> now<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> find<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.939> to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.959> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
arbiter now I find that to be a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.650 
arbiter now I find that to be a
really<00:02:22.410> great<00:02:22.650> feature<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:24.240> they<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.450> make

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
really great feature and if they do make

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.060 
really great feature and if they do make
halo<00:02:24.810> 2<00:02:25.020> anniversary<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.770> going<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.950> be<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
halo 2 anniversary that's going to be a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.190 
halo 2 anniversary that's going to be a
great<00:02:26.280> feature<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.820> come<00:02:27.120> back<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.540> tons<00:02:28.080> of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
great feature to come back and tons of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.430 
great feature to come back and tons of
fans<00:02:28.410> will<00:02:28.740> enjoy<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.340> plus<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:30.990> put<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
fans will enjoy that plus if they put it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.110 
fans will enjoy that plus if they put it
in<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.800> next<00:02:32.010> halo<00:02:32.340> game<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.060> know

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
in the next halo game because I know

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.210 
in the next halo game because I know
that<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.600> arbiter<00:02:34.200> has<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> big<00:02:34.800> part<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.100> do

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
that the arbiter has a big part to do

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.310 
that the arbiter has a big part to do
with<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.700> they<00:02:36.210> put<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> arbiter<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
with it if they put the arbiter in the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.710 
with it if they put the arbiter in the
next<00:02:37.530> day<00:02:37.590> looking<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.980> play<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.580> um<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.630> like

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
next day looking to play is um just like

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.300 
next day looking to play is um just like
the<00:02:39.840> master<00:02:40.020> chief<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.500> different<00:02:40.800> missions<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
the master chief in different missions I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
the master chief in different missions I
think<00:02:41.880> that'd<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.480> great<00:02:42.870> way<00:02:43.080> to

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
think that'd be a really great way to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.110 
think that'd be a really great way to
set<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.550> they're<00:02:44.670> gonna<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
set it up but if they're gonna do it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.760 
set it up but if they're gonna do it
they<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.600> do<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.900> right<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.380> if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
they have to do it right because if

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.170 
they have to do it right because if
there's<00:02:46.920> only<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.160> eight<00:02:47.490> missions<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
there's only like eight missions and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.660 
there's only like eight missions and
you're<00:02:48.270> playing<00:02:48.390> as<00:02:48.930> one<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.680> six<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.520> seven

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
you're playing as one like six or seven

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.280 
you're playing as one like six or seven
of<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.940> missions<00:02:51.240> then<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.600> make<00:02:51.780> no<00:02:51.990> sense

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
of the missions then it make no sense

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.860 
of the missions then it make no sense
whatsoever<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.790> whatever<00:02:54.030> whatever<00:02:54.630> they

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
whatsoever so whatever whatever they

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.260 
whatsoever so whatever whatever they
decide<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.230> deal<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.490> just<00:02:57.120> hope

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
decide to deal with this I just hope

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.430 
decide to deal with this I just hope
they<00:02:57.450> make<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:57.959> choice<00:02:58.200> because

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
they make the right choice because

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.040 
they make the right choice because
honestly<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.130> think<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:02:59.700> of<00:03:00.090> us<00:03:00.390> really<00:03:00.840> want
