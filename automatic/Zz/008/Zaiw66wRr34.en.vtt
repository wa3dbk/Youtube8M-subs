00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
other horses and that's I think one day

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790 
other horses and that's I think one day
that<00:02:51.090> make<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.540> all<00:02:51.690> very<00:02:51.720> special<00:02:52.260> when<00:02:52.650> we

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
that make it all very special when we

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.860 
that make it all very special when we
remember<00:02:53.160> there<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.970> bad<00:02:54.150> days<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.600> well<00:02:54.750> as

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
remember there the bad days as well as

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.809 
remember there the bad days as well as
the<00:02:55.019> good<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:56.010> how<00:02:56.160> does<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.370> new<00:02:56.610> horse

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the good so how does a new horse

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.229 
the good so how does a new horse
challenge<00:02:57.269> yourself<00:02:57.690> how<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.500> develop<00:02:58.920> I

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
challenge yourself how to to develop I

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.380 
challenge yourself how to to develop I
think<00:03:00.239> every<00:03:00.569> horse<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> new<00:03:01.440> challenge<00:03:01.920> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
think every horse is a new challenge and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.000 
think every horse is a new challenge and
I<00:03:03.390> think<00:03:03.600> that's<00:03:03.750> what<00:03:03.930> makes<00:03:04.140> our<00:03:04.350> sport<00:03:04.769> so

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
I think that's what makes our sport so

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.640 
I think that's what makes our sport so
special<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.420> man<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.260> woman<00:03:07.500> can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
special and that a man and a woman can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.440 
special and that a man and a woman can
compete<00:03:07.980> against<00:03:08.310> one<00:03:08.519> another<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:09.030> equal

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
compete against one another on equal

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.059 
compete against one another on equal
terms<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:11.010> every<00:03:11.310> horse<00:03:11.550> has<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.019> career

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
terms and that every horse has a career

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.320 
terms and that every horse has a career
but<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> opportunity<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.209> an

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
but you have the opportunity as an

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.560

back with with Keira and Richard so I've
come<00:06:24.010> full<00:06:24.160> circle<00:06:24.220> and<00:06:25.150> how<00:06:25.510> have<00:06:25.810> they

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
come full circle and how have they

shaped<00:06:26.260> you

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.950 

I<00:06:28.620> think<00:06:29.220> the<00:06:29.400> people<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.820> you<00:06:30.150> meet<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.630> the

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
I think the people that you meet and the

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.740 
I think the people that you meet and the
sport<00:06:31.320> and<00:06:31.620> your<00:06:31.770> horses<00:06:32.220> shaping<00:06:32.700> I<00:06:33.000> think

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
sport and your horses shaping I think

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.970 
sport and your horses shaping I think
it's<00:06:34.620> it's<00:06:35.160> a<00:06:35.280> journey<00:06:35.580> all<00:06:35.880> along<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:36.600> I

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
it's it's a journey all along and I

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.230 
it's it's a journey all along and I
think<00:06:37.980> you<00:06:38.100> learn<00:06:38.250> something<00:06:38.730> from<00:06:38.880> everybody

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
think you learn something from everybody

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.720 
think you learn something from everybody
I<00:06:39.630> don't<00:06:40.080> think<00:06:40.290> there's<00:06:40.530> any<00:06:40.980> one<00:06:41.220> person

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
I don't think there's any one person

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.730 
I don't think there's any one person
that<00:06:41.880> can<00:06:42.090> take<00:06:42.270> full<00:06:42.540> credit<00:06:42.780> but<00:06:43.230> everybody

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
that can take full credit but everybody

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.520 
that can take full credit but everybody
has<00:06:43.980> credit<00:06:44.430> for<00:06:45.060> everything<00:06:45.450> so<00:06:46.260> if<00:06:46.410> you're

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
has credit for everything so if you're

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.740 
has credit for everything so if you're
going<00:06:46.650> to<00:06:46.710> give<00:06:46.860> the<00:06:47.010> WDM<00:06:47.490> audience<00:06:47.910> three<00:06:48.419> and

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
think there's a lot of luck involved and

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.450 
think there's a lot of luck involved and
I<00:07:27.060> think<00:07:27.090> that's<00:07:27.479> the<00:07:27.720> the<00:07:28.650> main<00:07:28.860> thing<00:07:28.889> also

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
I think that's the the main thing also

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.760 
I think that's the the main thing also
with<00:07:29.760> the<00:07:29.850> horses<00:07:30.330> I<00:07:30.540> mean<00:07:31.050> they<00:07:31.380> have<00:07:31.530> to<00:07:31.560> be

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
with the horses I mean they have to be

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.750 
with the horses I mean they have to be
healthy<00:07:31.979> and<00:07:32.280> happy

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.760 
healthy and happy

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.580 
healthy and happy
and<00:07:32.940> I<00:07:33.660> think<00:07:33.720> that's<00:07:34.020> what<00:07:34.169> we<00:07:34.289> all<00:07:34.440> strive

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:34.590 
and I think that's what we all strive

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.390 
and I think that's what we all strive
for<00:07:35.100> to<00:07:35.789> have<00:07:36.180> happy<00:07:37.080> healthy<00:07:37.350> horses<00:07:37.830> and<00:07:38.250> be
