00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.270
 How long do you leave your car starting 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:12.110
 To protect the engine, especially in the same winter, we need warming up. 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:16.059
 How much would it be if I had to warm up again? 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.059
 Terrain. I found it through experiments. 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:25.610
 Even in the mid 1980's 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:30.020
 It was common sense to leave for a while after startup . 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.770
 Chinese New Year anhamyeon mechanical engine warm-up idling the air passages frozen boots 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:38.150
 This is because it is off or the car is the same. 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.280
 But this has diminished since more than a decade ago when electronic engines became commonplace. 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.699
 Why do they 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:52.070
 Nowadays, it is possible to use various operating conditions, namely cooling water temperature engine oil temperature 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:55.760
 Because we control all of diplomatic movement and control it electronically , 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.320
 You do not need to air a long time. 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 I tried to make it out of the actual winter season. 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.360
 Experimental infrared cars 20 hours without turning on the start in minus 11 degree field of view 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 Said over . 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.970
 Let's start the engine 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.369
 Ten seconds of coolant temperature rises 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:24.760
 Coolant and engine oil temperatures rise more steeply as you start your journey 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:28.390
 Standing gently to start would be more effective in fever . 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:32.590
 It is also true that ng 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.850
 Even if you start driving immediately , the engine speed drops only at the time of shifting 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.710
 The cooler's Rondo works up to normal . 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.090
 To get engine wear, oil must be evenly distributed to the engine, but personal time 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.730
 No need 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.820
 In Korea Weather finishing jjikeodo Why is earnestly spread within the intelligence within the 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.660
 Because the water is so gentle at the required site 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.110
 5 water from the Pagoda there is no need to Boise for a long time, 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.370
 The discloser is just a waste of time and fuel. 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.900
 Also, putting the gear in neutral and stepping on the accelerator pedal 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:12.490
 The water just touches the engine like a fast acceleration sphere . 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:18.420
 I started the engine, checked the tires, and started. 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.420
