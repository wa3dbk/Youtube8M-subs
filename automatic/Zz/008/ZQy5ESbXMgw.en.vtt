part of this exercise the last part of
this<00:00:56.309> lesson<00:00:56.550> involves<00:00:57.180> harmonizing<00:00:57.900> that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
this lesson involves harmonizing that

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.049 
this lesson involves harmonizing that
line<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:59.070> simple<00:00:59.370> voicings<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.879> we

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
line with some simple voicings that we

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729 
line with some simple voicings that we
use<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.479> part<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> first<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.650> we

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
use from part one so the first thing we

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.350 
use from part one so the first thing we
need<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.519> how<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.000> voicings

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
need to look at is how these voicings

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.780 
need to look at is how these voicings
are<00:01:03.510> constructed<00:01:04.050> so<00:01:04.260> these<00:01:05.159> voicings<00:01:05.580> are

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
are constructed so these voicings are

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.310 
are constructed so these voicings are
written<00:01:06.120> over<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.330> basic<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:06.930> five<00:01:07.140> one

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
written over a basic two five one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
written over a basic two five one
progression<00:01:07.970> let's<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.120> at<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
progression let's look at them first in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
progression let's look at them first in
the<00:01:09.840> key<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.140> C<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.070> our<00:01:11.100> progression<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.760> D

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the key of C so our progression is D

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.160

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 

you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.650> also<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.520> an<00:01:41.790> F<00:01:41.940> major

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you can also think of this as an F major

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.950 
you can also think of this as an F major
seven<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:43.080> D<00:01:43.260> or<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:44.220> major<00:01:44.700> seven<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.360> minor

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
third above the root of the chord

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.179 
third above the root of the chord
whichever<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> easiest<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.969 

okay<00:01:52.789> on<00:01:53.090> our<00:01:53.299> next<00:01:53.539> chord<00:01:53.780> our<00:01:53.929> g7<00:01:54.530> or<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.679> five

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
okay on our next chord our g7 or a five

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.620 
okay on our next chord our g7 or a five
chord<00:01:55.280> we're<00:01:55.880> gonna<00:01:55.969> have<00:01:56.179> an<00:01:56.299> altered

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
chord we're gonna have an altered

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.559 
chord we're gonna have an altered
dominant<00:01:57.109> chord<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.859> two<00:01:58.609> notes<00:01:58.969> are<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.509> to

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
dominant chord so two notes are going to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.569 
dominant chord so two notes are going to
be<00:01:59.630> altered<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.740> upper<00:02:01.219> part<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
be altered in the upper part of the

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.020 
be altered in the upper part of the
chord

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
chord

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.580 
chord
so<00:02:02.569> in<00:02:02.719> our<00:02:02.810> left<00:02:02.960> hand<00:02:03.049> we're<00:02:03.229> going<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.409> play

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so in our left hand we're going to play

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.639 
so in our left hand we're going to play
a<00:02:03.859> simple<00:02:04.219> shell<00:02:04.490> voicing<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.450> root<00:02:05.840> third<00:02:06.500> of

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
a simple shell voicing the root third of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.430 
a simple shell voicing the root third of
the<00:02:06.740> g7<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.569> our<00:02:08.660> right<00:02:08.869> hand<00:02:09.140> we're<00:02:09.349> gonna

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the g7 and in our right hand we're gonna

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.470 
the g7 and in our right hand we're gonna
play<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.860> seventh<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:11.180> flat<00:02:11.540> nine<00:02:12.010> third<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
play the seventh the flat nine third and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.350 
play the seventh the flat nine third and
B<00:02:14.720> sharp<00:02:14.959> five

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.470 

so<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.630> really<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.990> g7<00:02:20.650> flat<00:02:21.580> 9<00:02:21.819> sharp<00:02:22.209> 5

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so this is really a g7 flat 9 sharp 5

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.840 
so this is really a g7 flat 9 sharp 5
chord<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.950> let's<00:02:24.100> see<00:02:24.220> here<00:02:24.580> how<00:02:24.700> that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
chord so let's see here how that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.710 
chord so let's see here how that
resolves<00:02:25.270> from<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.510> 2<00:02:25.630> chord

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.510

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
hand a stack of thirds based on the 3rd

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.660 
hand a stack of thirds based on the 3rd
and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> 5th<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.450> 7th<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.590> 9th<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> C

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and the 5th and 7th and the 9th so a C

major<00:02:47.820> nine<00:02:48.090> chord<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.790> could<00:02:50.910> also

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
major nine chord here you could also

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.510 
major nine chord here you could also
think<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.750> an<00:02:51.900> E<00:02:52.080> minor<00:02:52.290> 7<00:02:52.800> over<00:02:53.040> C<00:02:53.280> or

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
think of this as an E minor 7 over C or

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.210 
think of this as an E minor 7 over C or
a<00:02:53.580> minor<00:02:54.390> 7<00:02:54.780> chord<00:02:54.810> built<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.530> major<00:02:55.890> third

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
a minor 7 chord built a major third

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.300 
a minor 7 chord built a major third
above<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.760> root

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.100 

then<00:03:02.880> give<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.300> exercise<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> little<00:03:04.020> more

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
then give this exercise a little more

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.839 
then give this exercise a little more
forward<00:03:04.380> motion<00:03:04.739> we're<00:03:04.920> going<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.280> resolve<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
forward motion we're going to resolve to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.729 
forward motion we're going to resolve to
a<00:03:05.880> six<00:03:06.209> chord<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:07.140> I've<00:03:07.230> made<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> little

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
a six chord but I've made it a little

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.979 
a six chord but I've made it a little
more<00:03:07.860> interesting<00:03:08.099> by<00:03:08.640> adding<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.239> sharp<00:03:09.510> 11<00:03:09.870> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
more interesting by adding a sharp 11 to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.290 
more interesting by adding a sharp 11 to
it<00:03:11.690> so<00:03:12.690> what<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:13.050> here<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.680> root<00:03:14.300> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
it so what we have here is the root the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.170 
it so what we have here is the root the
sixth<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.590> C<00:03:16.890> six<00:03:17.250> sharp<00:03:17.580> eleven<00:03:17.940> chord

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
sixth of the C six sharp eleven chord

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.330 
sixth of the C six sharp eleven chord
and<00:03:18.780> our<00:03:18.959> right<00:03:19.170> hand<00:03:19.200> we<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.980> ninth

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
and our right hand we have the ninth

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.330 
and our right hand we have the ninth
sharp<00:03:21.330> eleven<00:03:21.750> these<00:03:22.650> six<00:03:23.069> are<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
sharp eleven these six are the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.600 
sharp eleven these six are the
thirteenth<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.780> root<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> can

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
thirteenth and the root and you can

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.140 
thirteenth and the root and you can
think<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.819> this<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.599> d7<00:03:28.230> over<00:03:28.950> C<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.459> a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
think of this as a d7 over C or a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
think of this as a d7 over C or a
dominant<00:03:30.510> seven<00:03:30.989> chord<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.440> whole<00:03:31.769> step<00:03:32.010> above

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
dominant seven chord a whole step above

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.580 
dominant seven chord a whole step above
the<00:03:32.370> root<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.840> here's<00:03:34.019> what<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.230> sounds<00:03:34.350> like

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the root so here's what it sounds like

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:44.590 
the root so here's what it sounds like
all<00:03:34.739> put<00:03:34.890> together

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.580 

so<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> next<00:03:45.900> thing<00:03:46.050> that<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.230> did<00:03:46.320> with<00:03:46.440> this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
so the next thing that I did with this

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.830 
so the next thing that I did with this
exercise<00:03:46.890> was<00:03:47.700> try<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:47.910> write<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> melodic<00:03:48.630> line

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
exercise was try to write a melodic line

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.530 
exercise was try to write a melodic line
out<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.710> would<00:03:50.070> outline<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:51.030> voicings<00:03:51.480> that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
out that would outline the voicings that

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.210 
out that would outline the voicings that
we<00:03:51.690> played<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.050> first<00:03:52.200> part<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.130> we're

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
we played in the first part so we're

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.530 
we played in the first part so we're
going<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.370> use<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.550> same<00:03:53.760> simple<00:03:54.210> shell<00:03:54.390> voice

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
going to use the same simple shell voice

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.650 
going to use the same simple shell voice
inside<00:03:54.840> my<00:03:54.930> left<00:03:55.110> hand<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:57.120> our<00:03:57.240> right<00:03:57.450> hand

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
inside my left hand and our right hand

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.240 
inside my left hand and our right hand
we're<00:03:57.810> gonna<00:03:57.930> use<00:03:58.110> our<00:03:58.230> pezzi<00:03:58.530> O's<00:03:58.740> based<00:03:58.980> on

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
we're gonna use our pezzi O's based on

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.180 
we're gonna use our pezzi O's based on
those<00:03:59.930> voicings<00:04:00.930> from<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.200> first<00:04:01.380> part<00:04:01.620> so

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
those voicings from the first part so

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.640 
those voicings from the first part so
what<00:04:02.250> I've<00:04:02.370> done<00:04:02.520> is<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.910> start<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
what I've done is I start on the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.480 
what I've done is I start on the
second-to-last<00:04:04.650> note<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.190> each<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
second-to-last note in each of the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.790 
second-to-last note in each of the
voicing<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.090> our<00:04:06.210> first<00:04:06.360> voicing<00:04:06.810> I'm

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
voicing so in our first voicing I'm

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.830 
voicing so in our first voicing I'm
gonna<00:04:07.950> start<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.310> C<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:09.180> second-to-last

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
gonna start on the C the second-to-last

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.660 
gonna start on the C the second-to-last
highest<00:04:10.380> now<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.740> chord<00:04:10.950> I'm<00:04:11.430> going<00:04:11.610> to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
highest now to the chord I'm going to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:20.610 
highest now to the chord I'm going to
simply<00:04:11.940> go<00:04:11.970> down<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.330> voicing

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:31.409 

we're<00:04:21.160> going<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.489> our<00:04:21.609> g7<00:04:21.970> here<00:04:30.419> it's

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
we're going to our g7 here it's

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.150 
we're going to our g7 here it's
basically<00:04:31.540> a<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.169> simple<00:04:32.560> arpeggio

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
basically a just a simple arpeggio

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.939 
basically a just a simple arpeggio
movement<00:04:33.610> going<00:04:34.180> up<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.510> down<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.169> chords<00:04:35.560> so

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
movement going up and down the chords so

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:45.990 
movement going up and down the chords so
here<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.280> again<00:04:36.310> slowly

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.950 

you

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.730 

once<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.050> feel<00:04:54.200> comfortable<00:04:54.410> with<00:04:54.650> that

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
once you feel comfortable with that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.440 
once you feel comfortable with that
movement<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.430> last<00:04:55.640> step<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.060> each<00:04:56.210> of<00:04:56.360> these

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
movement the last step of each of these

the arpeggios from part two this

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.450 
the arpeggios from part two this
exercise<00:05:31.199> we're<00:05:31.680> gonna<00:05:31.770> play<00:05:31.980> our<00:05:32.070> voicing
