00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello youtuber what the whole if other 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.080
 people who want to know about this topic 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.059
 your friend xavi black greets you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.530
 this time I will talk about a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 subject that gave me a big headache 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.960
 which is the following the games for mini 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.630
 laptops or notebook that has been what 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.850
 same the point here is that many a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.920
 lack of a desktop pc we buy 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 a laptop or, failing that, a notebook 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 the thing is that normal laptops 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 They serve better for games and applications 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.009
 but the mini-laptops do not since these 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.320
 they were made and specially thought 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 for office jobs so your 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 processor does not run very complex games 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.969
 like the let for death gta 4 and in some 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 occasions in san andreas other 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 applications where you do not even 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 you can have illusions in installing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.160
 your notebook is for example the craft talk 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 this program serves to make talk to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 the images and give other effects 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.230
 funny pity another example is the and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 clone this serves to be 3d characters 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.370
 of type other people besides being able 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.629
 Give them animation to the point of power 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.989
 make a movie 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.899
 again pity 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.060
 If you have a cloud do not worry no 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.100
 everything is lost remember that with it 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.890
 you can still enter the internet to be 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.720
 jobs and so on I know you think that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.030
 anyway it would be great to be able 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.340
 enter it as a hobby or power 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.409
 put some great apps then 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.899
 Here are a few applications and 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.850
 games for your mini lap in terms of 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.179
 applications we refer to one of them 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.159
 is the next the best known text 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.320
 like a story with this you can have 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.690
 this voice as everything you write is 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.850
 you will hear this tool is very useful 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.610
 in case you should read a very long document 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.399
 only copies have and ready your equipment you 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.530
 will read everything to avoid videos one very 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.750
 Easy to use is the windows movie market 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.149
 in which you take images and add them 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.920
 sound is the program that I use too 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.890
 is the sony vegas but that I have not 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.049
 tested programs for photo editing 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.000
 for mini lar I did not meet but that 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.610
 does not mean that there is not 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.040
 now let's move on to the important thing the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.229
 video games the games that your notebook 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.270
 will run without any problem are those of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.790
 low requirements like the right of end 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.440
 periÃ©s this is a very good game other 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.090
 problem is that the mini does not have 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.880
 fp slot but do not worry 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.770
 there are adapters or you can download it 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.930
 direct internet other are the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.380
 emulators that would be those of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.360
 nintendo 64 playstation 1 game boy with 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 the game boy do yes up to the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.890
 nintendo ds when you download the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.440
 emulator you can play all the roms that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.440
 you discard it in case you do not know the roms 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 are the games if you are an arcade lover 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.340
 you can download the neo emulator 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.400
 geo that contains the games of the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.320
 little machines do not worry about anything you 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.690
 It does not look good, it will do much for both 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.160
 I work like to recreate you enjoy 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.989
 the games you can play 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.020
 accompanied by a joystick will make you 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.390
