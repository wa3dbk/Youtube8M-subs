something important a big chunk of the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.770 
something important a big chunk of the
paint<00:01:45.369> will<00:01:45.549> blow<00:01:45.700> off<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.149> masking<00:01:46.630> that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
paint will blow off of the masking that

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.080 
paint will blow off of the masking that
was<00:01:46.990> dried<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.380> get<00:01:48.280> into<00:01:48.490> your<00:01:48.549> good<00:01:48.759> paint

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
was dried and get into your good paint

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.149 
was dried and get into your good paint
so<00:01:49.329> it's<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.630> use<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.049> plastic<00:01:50.770> sheeting

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
so it's just use this plastic sheeting

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.530 
so it's just use this plastic sheeting
one<00:01:52.090> time<00:01:52.390> or<00:01:52.630> perhaps<00:01:52.780> two<00:01:53.229> times<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:54.219> never

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
one time or perhaps two times but never

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.160 
one time or perhaps two times but never
use<00:01:55.540> it<00:01:55.719> before<00:01:56.200> you're<00:01:56.350> going<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.619> color<00:01:56.860> coat

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
use it before you're going to color coat

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.469 
use it before you're going to color coat
you've<00:01:59.170> got<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.320> fixture<00:01:59.619> here<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.009> hold<00:02:00.219> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you've got a fixture here to hold the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.929 
you've got a fixture here to hold the
targa<00:02:01.479> top<00:02:01.770> edge<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.399> paint<00:02:03.640> all<00:02:03.789> of

targa top edge so I can paint all of

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.440 
targa top edge so I can paint all of
that<00:02:04.090> at<00:02:04.240> one<00:02:04.390> time<00:02:04.719> so<00:02:05.710> right<00:02:05.860> before<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.450> paint

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.190 
that at one time so right before I paint
I<00:02:07.719> took<00:02:07.899> some<00:02:08.050> compressed<00:02:08.530> air<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:10.020> blew<00:02:11.020> all

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
I took some compressed air and blew all

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.640 
I took some compressed air and blew all
the<00:02:11.560> nooks<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.700> cranny's<00:02:13.090> out<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.390> car

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
well so they'll further complicate

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.080

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
clear coat so it's gonna be a little bit

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.280 
clear coat so it's gonna be a little bit
of<00:03:28.069> an<00:03:28.160> experiment<00:03:28.760> for<00:03:28.940> me<00:03:29.000> I've<00:03:29.840> painted<00:03:30.049> a

the state of the art back then but we'll

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.900 
the state of the art back then but we'll
see<00:03:39.139> how<00:03:39.169> it<00:03:39.410> goes<00:03:39.590> for<00:03:39.859> this<00:03:39.980> base<00:03:40.310> coat<00:03:40.579> clear

on<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.120> corner<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:32.720> got<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:32.900> little<00:05:33.140> run

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
on the corner and I got a little run

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.620 
on the corner and I got a little run
down<00:05:33.500> there<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:34.640> what<00:05:34.910> I'm<00:05:34.970> gonna<00:05:35.090> do<00:05:35.270> is<00:05:35.390> set

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
down there so what I'm gonna do is set

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.540 
down there so what I'm gonna do is set
it<00:05:35.660> aside<00:05:35.870> let<00:05:36.230> it<00:05:36.350> dry<00:05:36.560> well<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.130> I'll<00:05:37.220> sand

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
it aside let it dry well and I'll sand

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.220 
it aside let it dry well and I'll sand
those<00:05:37.820> runs<00:05:38.480> out<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.870> give<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:38.990> one<00:05:39.200> final

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
those runs out and give it one final

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.590 
those runs out and give it one final
coat<00:05:39.800> of<00:05:40.040> yellow<00:05:40.370> before<00:05:40.640> I<00:05:40.820> clear<00:05:41.090> coat<00:05:41.330> that

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
coat of yellow before I clear coat that

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.930 
coat of yellow before I clear coat that
part<00:05:42.040> otherwise<00:05:43.040> these<00:05:43.310> other<00:05:43.520> parts<00:05:43.820> are

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
part otherwise these other parts are

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.280 
part otherwise these other parts are
gonna<00:05:44.060> get<00:05:44.270> clear<00:05:44.480> cluttered<00:05:44.810> here<00:05:44.990> in<00:05:45.080> about

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
gonna get clear cluttered here in about

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:52.659 
gonna get clear cluttered here in about
an<00:05:45.410> hour<00:05:45.530> or<00:05:45.710> so

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.330 

well

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
well

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.720 
well
try<00:05:54.639> to<00:05:54.700> clear<00:05:55.030> coats<00:05:55.300> on<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.660> car<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.740> you

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
try to clear coats on the car and you

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.310 
try to clear coats on the car and you
can<00:05:57.910> see<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.240> reflection<00:05:58.389> of<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.900> light<00:05:58.930> bulb

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
can see the reflection of the light bulb

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.160 
can see the reflection of the light bulb
in<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.560> so<00:05:59.920> all<00:06:00.100> in<00:06:00.250> all<00:06:00.340> I'm<00:06:00.490> pretty<00:06:00.730> happy

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
in it so all in all I'm pretty happy

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
in it so all in all I'm pretty happy
every<00:06:02.170> time<00:06:02.350> I<00:06:02.470> paint<00:06:02.710> there's<00:06:02.950> always<00:06:03.070> a

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
every time I paint there's always a

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.710 
every time I paint there's always a
learning<00:06:03.340> curve<00:06:03.730> because<00:06:03.940> it's<00:06:04.150> about<00:06:04.450> 10

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
learning curve because it's about 10

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.480 
learning curve because it's about 10
years<00:06:04.870> between<00:06:05.169> everything<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.740> paint<00:06:06.070> in

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
years between everything I paint in

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.810 
years between everything I paint in
sixty<00:06:06.970> years<00:06:07.150> old<00:06:07.330> now<00:06:08.340> one<00:06:09.340> thing<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:09.610> learned

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
sixty years old now one thing I learned

sixty years old now one thing I learned
with<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.000> clear<00:06:10.660> coat<00:06:10.900> is<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:12.389> you<00:06:13.389> have<00:06:13.510> to

with a clear coat is that you have to

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.210 
with a clear coat is that you have to
open<00:06:13.870> up<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.080> gun<00:06:14.230> a<00:06:14.260> little<00:06:14.380> bit<00:06:14.530> more<00:06:14.860> maybe

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
open up the gun a little bit more maybe

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.920 
open up the gun a little bit more maybe
place<00:06:15.520> a<00:06:15.880> little<00:06:15.970> bit<00:06:16.120> of<00:06:16.240> reduce<00:06:16.510> runner<00:06:16.810> to

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
place a little bit of reduce runner to

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.590 
place a little bit of reduce runner to
get<00:06:17.050> it<00:06:17.139> to<00:06:17.230> flow<00:06:17.410> out<00:06:17.440> well<00:06:18.090> so<00:06:19.090> this<00:06:19.270> parts

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
get it to flow out well so this parts
